Overview
Message from our Group CEO
I am very proud to present the first global Perfetti 
Van Melle (PVM) CSR report. We are a multinational 
confectionery group with a remarkable track record 
of success and growth in the markets in which 
we operate.
Over the years, we have built a great reputation 
for conducting business responsibly and to high 
ethical standards. Our priority is to preserve such  
a great reputation, as this is crucial to our success 
in the long term. 
With such a large organisation (31 production 
facilities, 38 companies and 17 ,887 employees) we 
feel the need to give clearer guidance to our people 
and to our stakeholders on the value of integrating 
CSR practices in both our daily operations and in 
our decision-making processes. 
This is our first structured and systematic approach 
to CSR on a global level, in previous years we have 
reported our CSR efforts, initiatives and programmes 
at a local level only. This report gives a more 
consistent structure and visibility to the priorities that 
impact the sustainability of our business globally.
OUR CONSUMERS
We are committed to ensuring the highest possible 
product safety and evolving our portfolio to best 
meet consumers’ lifestyle and dietary needs. 
Consumers’ needs and expectations always 
guide our progress in product development and 
innovation. New product developments always 
account for a significant part of our global turnover 
and much of this value comes from new products 
that combine the desire for gratification and 
pleasure with the need to reduce sugar intake and 
ensure the overall well-being of our consumers, in 
both the candy and in the chewing gum categories.
I am proud of the commitment that we are taking 
in being transparent with our consumers on the 
calorie content of our products: all our sugar-based 
candies and chocolate products will feature 
information on calorie content per piece. This  
clear, simple and straightforward information on 
the product label makes it easier for the consumer 
to calculate and compare energy intake and make 
the best choice based on their dietary needs.

continued
This first report will help us better focus our 
corporate social responsibility strategy for the  
years to come. We are conscious that real changes 
can only occur step by step, we need the support 
and involvement of all stakeholders; suppliers, 
commercial partners, employees and our 
consumers. This report demonstrates that we are 
determined and passionate about making CSR 
part of how we conduct business on a daily basis.
This project has been an engaging and learning 
experience for those colleagues involved from 
cross-functional and cross-geographical teams, 
and I would like to thank them and all my PVM 
colleagues around the world for their continued 
contribution to ensuring the long-term success 
of our group, based on concrete and authentic 
socially, environmentally sustainable actions.
 
Sameer Suneja
Executive Director and Group CEO
We are committed to removing artificial colourings 
from all our products, both new and existing. It 
will be a long and difficult process, as it implies 
reformulating a large number of products. We 
began the process a few years ago and we will 
continue with determination, to reconfirm our 
commitment to produce and deliver the safest 
products available for our consumers worldwide.
THE ENVIRONMENT & OUR PRODUCTION 
FACILITIES
Our manufacturing companies are taking great 
steps forward in managing their environmental 
impact. Most of our production facilities are 
ISO14001 certified, showing our determination 
to adapt our organisation and our manufacturing 
processes in a way that minimises our impact on 
the environment. Energy from renewable sources, 
in particular self-produced bio-gas from effluent 
treatment plants, is already in use at a number 
of manufacturing sites. In this first report, we are 
tracking our manufacturing carbon footprint on  
a global level. This will enable us to set global 
targets for the coming years.
SAFETY & HEALTH
Our manufacturing facilities are also making many 
efforts to guarantee that Health and Safety receive 
top priority action and attention. As illustrated in 
this report, we have taken commitments to ensure 
that all plants are fully compliant, not only with local 
and international legislation, but also with industry 
and stringent certification standards.
OUR PEOPLE
Our employees are our most precious asset. 
Attracting, motivating and engaging them is 
the most fascinating and rewarding task for 
management. Perfetti Van Melle benefits 
from its reputation as a fair employer, but we 
offer more than that at PVM. We have created 
an environment in which passion, expertise, 
entrepreneurship and friendliness thrive.  
The report highlights the steps taken and the 
importance of continuing and improving our 
practices to create a fair and engaging work 
environment for our employees. In 2015, we 
conducted our first global employee engagement 
survey which recorded a very positive global score, 
higher than the benchmark for food and beverages 
companies. In 2017, we will conduct our second 
global survey and we hope to report further 
progress in ensuring that all our employees 
can actually “unwrap their potential” at PVM.
OUR COMMUNITIES
Our operations play a role in the local communities 
in which they operate. Most communities provide 
our labour force, skills and competencies. We 
want to make a difference in those communities, 
in terms of supporting local social, cultural  
and medical needs. We have programmes 
and initiatives in place to help and support local 
communities and the report illustrates some good 
examples. We are keen to continue and further 
enhance our efforts to really improve the lives 
of many people living around us.

Overview
About this report
This is the first Perfetti Van Melle 
(PVM) global annual CSR report. 
The information in the report covers 
the period from 1 January to 
31 December 2016. PVM is one of 
the world’s largest manufacturers 
and distributors of confectionery 
and chewing gum with 38 Operating 
Companies worldwide. In this report, 
an Operating Company is the legal 
entity for which activities primarily 
consist of the production and/or 
sales of confectionery products. 
Manufacturing Operating Companies 
refers to legal entities with production 
facilities only. 
As we move towards a global, integrated and 
coordinated CSR approach, this report allows us to 
evaluate our Manufacturing Operating Companies’ 
current CSR efforts and to plan for the future. As 
this is a global CSR report, we intend to gradually 
expand the scope of this report by including our 
non-Manufacturing Operating Companies.
This report is prepared in accordance with the Global 
Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Standards 
(GRI Standards): Core. This report is also guided by 
the GRI G4 Food Processing Sector Disclosures. 
As this is our first report, there are no restatements 
of information and we have not sought external 
assurance.
We will publish our next report in 2018 which will 
cover data and improvements for the 2017 period.

Sustainability Report 2016
Always innovating what confectionery can do
At PVM we are focused on constantly improving 
our entire business: our products, our factories, 
our relationships with customers and suppliers, 
everything we do, in an effort to make a positive 
impact on people’s lives with our products. Our 
Purpose spans over the entire portfolio of brands 
and over all countries in which we operate.
In 2015 we shared with all our employees across 
the globe Our Blueprint for the Future, a plan 
designed to guide our Group in the next five 
years that highlights our company Purpose, 
sets an ambitious business goal, dynamic growth 
strategies and indicates the behaviours that all 
employees will adopt to ensure that we are all 
aligned in what we do.
This Blueprint for the Future, drawing from the 
Mission, Vision and Values that have been guiding 
the Group since 2001, is our roadmap that can 
guarantee our long-term success.

Overview
CSR at Perfetti Van Melle
We recognise and value the role 
we play in our communities. We are 
serious about corporate responsibility. 
We care passionately about and value 
our customers, our people and 
the environment. 
Most importantly, we are extremely particular  
about following the food law and regulations of the 
countries in which we operate. All ingredients are 
tested and certified food safe before use and are 
subject to strict quality controls to meet food safety 
standards. All our products go through extensive 
shelf life and stability tests. We are proud of our 
track record and happy to share information 
about our progress.
Our recipe for being responsible
In 2016, we established our global CSR framework 
“Being Responsible” that enables us to prioritise 
our global efforts around five key pillars and create 
specific actions within those pillars. This is closely 
aligned with our Mission and Values that guide our 
actions in conducting our business as responsible 
members of society. This CSR report is structured 
based on this framework.
OUR VALUES
The following values guide our actions:
Integrity Without Compromise
We conduct our business with honesty, integrity, and 
respect for those with whom we have relationships.
Achieving Excellence
We pursue quality in everything we do. We strive 
for continuous improvement in the way we operate. 
Unremitting attention is given to details at every stage 
and resources are used in the most efficient way.
Dedication to the Consumer
We will meet and exceed the differing needs and 
expectations of our consumers, offering them high 
quality, state-of-the-art and innovative products.
Care for our People
We are committed to creating a global workplace 
where teamwork, involvement, open communication, 
flexibility and fun exist. We treat our people fairly; 
we value different styles, skills, experiences 
and backgrounds and acknowledge that these 
differences result in greater creativity and better 
insights. We encourage them to take initiative and 
expect them to approach their jobs with passion 
and commitment. We offer our people training 
opportunities and ongoing development so that 
each individual can reach his or her full potential.
Social and Environmental Responsibility
We will conduct our business as responsible 
members of society, respecting the laws of the 
countries in which we operate, contributing to the 
progress of the local communities in line with the 
legitimate role of the business. We will operate safely, 
responsibly, and with sound environmental practices, 
aimed at minimising our impact on the environment 
and working toward long-term sustainability.
Independence 
We are committed to achieving ambitious business 
goals whilst securing our company’s profitability 
thus ensuring our independent growth.

Overview
CSR at Perfetti Van Melle: Stakeholder engagement
continued
Who we listened to
There are many types of stakeholder 
groups with whom we engage. When 
considering the groups which are 
essential to our results and the groups 
most affected by our activities, our 
most important stakeholders are:
 • Customers
 • Consumers
 • NGOs
 • Employees
 • Government
 • Suppliers
 • Media
We have regular contact with all our stakeholders 
as part of our daily activities to ensure that we 
are listening and meeting their expectations.
For this, our first global CSR report, we engaged 
205 internal stakeholders to determine the topics 
most important to us. Those included were 
managerial staff and above including Executive 
Committee members. 
How we ensure that our recipe works
We strive to act responsibly across a wide range 
of social and environmental issues, including 
positive community involvement, good 
environmental practices, product safety, 
responsible marketing, high employee 
engagement and good labour practices.
CSR at PVM has always been a matter of good 
management, ethical conduct and respect for our 
people, our partners, the environment and society. 
We are convinced that our customers, employees 
and all our stakeholders expect the best from us, 
and we would not accept any less of ourselves.
Under the Executive Committee’s direction and 
with the strong leadership of our CEO and support 
of our senior management team, CSR is being 
increasingly embedded throughout the company. 
Plans for investment at our production facilities 
take into consideration environmental impact 
goals; new product developments are subject to 
consumer needs; packaging is carefully evaluated 
in terms of environmentally friendly features; and 
we consider treating our employees well to be an 
ethical duty and a standard to be implemented 
at all our production facilities.
We established a global CSR governance structure 
to oversee the management and implementation 
of our global CSR approach. The CSR Steering 
Committee consists of cross-function senior leaders 
who oversee our CSR approach and report to the 
Group Executive Committee and CEO on progress. 
The CSR Project Team consists of cross-function 
middle management leaders who coordinate 
and execute the CSR strategy across six working 
groups. Five working groups are responsible for 
managing specific material topics identified 
and the sixth working group consists of regional 
coordinators that communicate and coordinate 
with the Manufacturing Operating Companies.
PVM is releasing its first CSR report to communicate 
to stakeholders our efforts, challenges and 
achievements in all of these areas. We strive to 
make reporting as transparent, comprehensive 
and relevant to our business as possible.

Get the right people in
Ensure we select the best people and

We have a robust hiring process including the 
use of psychometrics which is designed on our 
competencies. This ensures that we get the right 
candidate who is capable of doing the job as 
well as a good fit with the organisation.
Build and Reward Performance
Ensure the right skills, capabilities and focus  
to deliver in current role
We offer employees competitive remuneration 
packages commensurate with experience, 
performance and job responsibilities. To ensure 
that the remuneration package stays relevant 
and competitive, we participate in annual surveys 
to benchmark against the market. Depending 
on company performance, eligible employees 
receive an annual bonus/incentives payment.
Along with our performance management and 
remuneration policies and processes, we strongly 
support teamwork as a way of reaching and 
delivering an inspiring and ambitious set of 
common goals. We recognise and reward 
competencies and performance.
Grow a strong talent pipeline
Ensure we have the right people in the right 
numbers at the right time
We conduct a Talent review process which is a key 
component of our Talent Management practices. 
It focuses on our current leadership strength and 
future talent needs to support business goals.  
It aims to:
 • Assess the strength of leadership in  
key positions
 • Assess the strength of the succession bench
 • Identify successors for key positions
 • Plan interventions to meet talent needs: 
development, acquisition, replacements
Develop credible successors
Test succession hypothesis and action  
development needs
Investing and developing people to perform 
their current jobs more skilfully and efficiently is  
a priority and focus area for us. Our Leadership 
Development Programmes are directed towards 
identifying and grooming the leaders for tomorrow.
Develop an organisation that works
Ensure the right organisation and culture  
and the capability to manage change well
We engaged Willis Towers Watson to conduct 
our first global engagement survey in 2015. 
Over 13,000 employees, 97% of our workforce, 
participated in our first ever global Employee 
Engagement Survey. Our overall sustainable 
engagement score is higher than the benchmark of 
Food and Beverage companies worldwide and 2% 
lower than the Global High Performance Norm we 
are aspiring to. The engagement score reflects that 
we feel motivated, energised and enabled to deliver 
our best every day at work and sustain it over time. 
In 2017, a second global Employee Engagement 
Survey will be conducted.

Labour relations
In all the countries where we have Manufacturing 
Operating Companies, our employees are eligible 
to join unions with exceptions where unions do 
not allow certain employees to become members: 
expatriates in the USA and Vietnam, senior 
managers in Nigeria and the USA, human resource 
managers in Nigeria and non-factory workers in 
Mexico. This means 93% of our employees are 
eligible to join unions of which 52% are part 
of a union. 
We had two incidents of industrial disputes in 2016. 
In August, workers in our Shanghai production 
facility went on strike over the compensation of 
overtime hours which resulted in a loss of 4,300 
working hours. We resolved this by applying to the 
local government for a ‘Comprehensive Working 
Hours’ licence. We have communicated our 
comprehensive working hours policy to our 
employees with the support from the local 
government and union and the issue has been 
resolved. In November, our production facility 
in Nigeria experienced a protest by the union 
around the postponement of a meeting to
discuss employee benefits resulting in the loss of 
336 working hours. This was resolved through an 
agreement with the union on changes to payment 
methodology for employees in-line with the union’s 
recommendation which had no cost implications 
for the business. 
Health and safety
Health and safety is among our values and we have 
a non-negotiable commitment to provide a safe 
and healthy working environment for all employees, 
third party contractors working on our premises 
and visitors. Our ambition is to be fully compliant 
with local and international legislation and industry 
standards. Where law and regulations are non-
existent or not enforced, we apply our health and 
safety standards. We want to give our employees 
meaningful jobs in which they can contribute, 
grow and develop to the fullest, all in an inspiring 
environment where ambition, performance, 
support, trust and collaboration reign supreme. 
Going forward we are drafting common policies 
and standards in order to ensure that we have

Being a responsible employer
continued
From January 2017, all Manufacturing Operating 
Companies are required to report non-financial Key 
Performance Indicators (KPIs) on a monthly basis. 
Safety & Health KPIs include Lost Time Accident 
(LTA) rate, days lost rate in production (due to LTA), 
near miss accidents and illness rates. We are 
also in the process of developing definitions and 
collecting data on “near misses”. Gaining more 
insights in these KPI’s will enhance the process 
of reviewing these definitions and defining new 
KPI’s. These will be implemented and reported 
in our 2018 report.
We are collecting standardised KPIs and data in 
all Manufacturing Operating Companies. Based on 
the analysis of Manufacturing Operating Company 
Safety & Health performance, clear objectives will be 
provided in an action plan for every Manufacturing 
Operating Company by 2018. From 2018, we will 
start collecting data by gender and type of injury. 
We have a strong commitment to the safety and 
health of employees. Developing a safe workplace 
is a process in which PVM is continuously looking 
for improvements. Over the last few years, safety 
campaigns ran on most production sites. All 
workplaces have been equipped to comply 
with laws and regulations. Internal occupational 
health and safety study groups have been 
established specifically to monitor and 
improve working conditions.

We are striving for ‘Zero accidents and work-related 
injuries – illness’ therefore raising awareness is 
crucial to enable us to achieve this. By providing 
information, training (safe ways of working, first 
aid and emergency response) we want to make 
employees more aware of the measures they 
can take themselves to work safely and healthy.
Going forward, we shall strive to improve our 
Safety and Health performance by pursuing 
the following objectives:
1. Prevent risks at source by reducing the 
likelihood of occurrence, through developing 
and evaluating products and materials, 
improving operating procedures and processes; 
2. Continue to improve the focus on excellence  
in terms of working environments and tools – 
making them safer, more ergonomic and 
ensuring long-term sustainability for operations;
3. Encourage employees’ active involvement  
and participation in developing a culture  
that favours improved processes and control  
of preventative aspects through employee 
health and safety representatives;
4. Motivate all employees to demonstrate safe 
behaviour and healthy habits in the workplace 
and in everyday life; 
5. Achieve and maintain a level of zero injuries 
whilst analysing all events so as to prevent 
possible accidents reported through 
development and implementation, as well as 
assessing efficiency of plans for improvement;
6. Insist that health and safety awareness training 
and competency specific training activities be 
carried out by all personnel; 
7. Ensure that all business partners, embrace  
and practice our values; 
8. Oversee that all prevention and protection 
measures foreseen by our operational 
procedures are carefully followed by  
all employees, supervisors, managers  
and directors;
9. Further supplement KPIs that meet 
international safety standards;
10. Set objectives and monitor performances  
to guarantee continuous improvement of 
results and our way of operating.

Celebrating the 70th anniversary of  
Perfetti Van Melle Lainate
The origins of our Group traces back to 1946 
when Perfetti (as the company was then known) 
was founded in Lainate, a small town close to 
Milan, Italy. 
In September 2016, we celebrated this important 
milestone together with the local community over 
the course of a weekend. Over 3,000 people visited 
our production facility, which had been specially 
fitted with installations with the theme that had 
been chosen for the event “a long journey 
through taste”. 
The event was organised and managed by our 
employees. 200 volunteers guided the visitors 
around the production facility explaining processes 
and products. The production facility was in 
operation and the public was invited to join us  
in tastings, theatrical sketches and fun activities.
A famous street artist painted a mural along 
one of the production facility walls to remind 
us of this journey that is going to continue 
long into the future. 
We received many positive comments from the 
local community expressing the pride that they 
have hosting such a friendly and future focused 
company as Perfetti Van Melle in the town 
where they live. 
The event was an engaging experience for our 
employees, who worked in cross-functional, 
cross-generation, cross-skill teams delivering  
their best through passion and determination.

Be the Change 
Be the Change is an initiative developed in 2015 
by our Manufacturing Operating Company in Spain. 
It focused on the profitability, effectiveness and 
efficiency of PVM to build a sustainable future 
as well as shaping new behaviours and actions 
that enable transformation. Be the Change 
campaigns require that employees work within 
their departments to actively contribute initiatives  
to improve efficiencies, processes, costs as well 
as to work in cross-functional teams on the design 
and implementation of change projects arising  
from the initiatives contributed by the departments.
Feel the Change 
In 2016, we advanced to “Feel the Change” 
where we continued with the same focus and 
give global recognition to the value of the effort 
that employees have dedicated in order to 
change habits and attitudes.
Empower the Change 
For 2017, the initiative will evolve to “Empower the 
Change” where we will raise the tempo again to 
inject energy into the transformation process, be 
ambitious with challenges we propose, engage  
in the path taken by PVM, share the illusion of 
reaching more and better, collaborate in order to 
achieve better results and, be passionate about 
new ideas, projects and improvements. Empower 
the Change will seek out our employees’ brilliant 
minds for initiatives that aim to boost sales growth 
and profitability, push and develop new products, 
optimise our capabilities in CSR and to develop 
the competency levels of our leadership and 
functional employees.
Employee Selling Day 
This initiative was to create 
excitement and pride for our 
employees in Indonesia with 
the launch of Big Babol Asteroid 
and Alpenliebe Lollypop. 
Over 1,565 employees were 
competing to win the sales 
competition. We embraced 
consumers in the surrounding 
district of Cibinong where our 
production facility is located and 
nearby cities. The activity created 
a fun day for employees and 
enabled us to share the pride and 
fun of our new product launch.

Being compliant
Our Group’s reputation for being 
an honest, fair and capable company 
with which to do business is one 
of our most valuable assets which 
we are determined to preserve. 
Maintaining high ethical standards 
within our company and in our 
relations with customers, suppliers, 
authorities and the public in general 
is vital to our continuous success 
wherever we operate. 
Code of Conduct
Our PVM Code of Conduct (CoC) sets forth the 
principles that apply to all PVM employees. It 
is important that its content is well known and 
understood by each of us, as it highlights our 
responsibility, as a Group and as individuals, to 
implement and protect our core values and our 
ethical standards in the way we do business. We 
rely on our CoC and Values to guide our behaviour 
every day and everywhere, making PVM a great 
company to work for and to work with.
The CoC is approved by the Board of Directors of 
Perfetti Van Melle Group B.V. (Group) that contains 
the principles and commitments undertaken by the 
Group and all 38 Operating Companies belonging 
to the Group and by each one of its employees, 
governing our behaviour both towards the Group 
and to third parties.
The purpose of the CoC is to communicate to 
all PVM employees, managers and stakeholders  
of every Operating Company of the Group, our 
commitment to adhering to ethical principles 
under all circumstances, and in particular to:
 • comply with the laws and regulations of  
each country where the Group operates;
 • be equitable, fair and polite in relationships  
with fellow employees;
 • respect the interests of all stakeholders 
(customers, consumers, business partners, 
government agencies, authorities and the 
external community);
 • play our business role with professionalism  
and integrity.
The principles contained in the CoC are the 
foundation of our corporate policies and inspire 
the practices, guidelines and operating procedures 
adopted by the Group. Whenever more detailed 
clarifications are needed on how to implement the 
Group’s values and culture in operational practices, 
specific guidelines will be issued to supplement 
those already existing. 
All employees are required to read the CoC and 
to conform their conduct to the principles stated. 
Compliance with the provisions of the CoC is 
considered an essential part of the contractual 
obligations of employees and any person or 
entity conducting business with the Group.
The CoC details how to report any violations of 
the Code and the measures to be applied in the 
event of a violation.
 
We provide CoC, whistleblowing and reporting 
ethical concerns training online and in classroom 
sessions. In September 2016, all employees 
participated in the eLearning course with  
local translation and on-site classroom 
and face-to-face training. 
By 2017, our toll-free EthicsPoint Hotline and 
EthicsPoint.com will be operational for employees 
to utilise. Employees can then provide feedback 
or report unethical practices online or by calling  
the hotline, both are managed by the Group 
Compliance Office. 
In 2016, all our 
employees globally 
participated in 
a customised training 
course on our Code 
of Conduct, either by 
eLearning or on-site, 
classroom and 
face-to-face training.

Making the workplace Fun and Fair
“Perfetti Van Melle’s business has grown 
substantially in Asia. During this time we have 
developed our professional and management 
capabilities to better compete and excel in 
the marketplace. Attraction, retention and 
development of talent, especially in emerging 
markets, continues to be a primary challenge for 
us. As we continue to focus on business growth 
and human capital, we put more emphasis on 
compliance and ensuring our employees adhere  
to the guidelines set in our Code of Conduct. 
This helps to promote a safe and fair working 
environment in every location and ensure we 
are compliant with the most advanced Food 
Safety and Quality Standards. 
It is great working for an organisation which is 
characterised by fun, creativity and innovation! 
These are important ingredients of our daily life  
at work despite our multiple challenges, duties  
and responsibilities.
The first global CSR report is a major milestone  
for Perfetti Van Melle. I am very proud that a large 
number of our colleagues from many different 
functions took the commitment to make this 
happen. They put in extra time and made 
a big effort to support the collection of data  
and materials that are not always available as 
consolidated information. This project would 
not have been successful without them.”

Practising responsible marketing
In compliance with our Code of 
Conduct (CoC) and global food 
industry requirements, we are 
committed to communicate and 
advertise our products responsibly.
We support consumption in 
moderation and our advertising 
communication will not depict 
over consumption of food and 
of our products. We ensure the 
message and tone of our advertising 
communication is responsible, 
for example, we will not depict 
stereotypes, explicit sexual 
behaviour or controversial subjects. 
In 2016, we established a Group Statement, 
consistent with our Code of Conduct, that 
elaborates our responsible marketing and 
advertising position. We have also developed a 
Marketing Code that sets internal rules for our 
communication materials. We use a combination 
of local guidelines, our Group Statement and 
Marketing Code when we conduct briefings 
to creative and media agencies. 
Our core principles from our Marketing Code listed 
below shape the way our Sales and Marketing 
teams communicate and advertise globally  
across all media platforms:
 • Our advertising messages will not encourage 
over consumption;
 • Messages will encourage an active lifestyle 
(especially among the youth);
 • Our advertising messages will not feature 
children below seven years consuming 
confectionery products. Children may be 
featured in our advertising and promotional 
communication as part of a family situation  
or in a playful environment, when relevant  
to the marketing message;
 • Our advertising will feature products in a 
reasonable portion size for the situation depicted;
 • Our communication and advertising messages 
do not treat our product as substitute for meals 
but as snacks and treats.
We respect local guidelines and rules on 
responsible advertising. 
We do not track complaints or fines relating to 
responsible marketing and advertising. In 2017 
we will evaluate the possibility of tracking to 
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach.

Promoting consumer well-being
We live in an era with an array 
of food choices and increasingly 
sedentary lifestyles. Convenience, 
wealth, family lifestyles, media and 
the overconsumption of sugars 
all play a part in rising obesity 
and diabetes rates.
Added sugars are common components of 
modern-day diets, found in a wide range of foods 
and drinks, including confectionery. In addition to 
providing sweetness and an attractive taste, sugars 
are a source of energy. Confectionery products 
contain added sugars, and therefore best to 
be enjoyed in moderation. The World Health 
Organization suggests that sugars added to food 
and drinks by manufacturers, also called ‘free’ 
sugars, should be reduced to less than 10% of a 
person’s daily energy intake. For an adult requiring 
2,000 kcal a day, this equates to no more than 
200 kcal from free sugars, about 50 grams or 
12 teaspoons of sugar. 
We believe that the reduction of sugar intake can 
be achieved as a result of numerous actions taken 
by consumers. We are also aware of the key role 
that the confectionery industry can play and for this 
reason our Group R&D, Marketing and Regulatory 
teams adopted a multi-faceted strategy based 
on three main goals:
1.  Transparent calorie content information on  
our sugar based candies and chocolates  
for consumers
By displaying calorie content information on the 
front of pack of our main sugar-based packaged 
candies and chocolate, we help our consumers  
to be aware of product calorie intake and we 
facilitate the comparison among different options. 
Consumers can make the best choice based  
on their personal dietary needs, health style  
and requirements. 
For all new sugar based candies, lollipops and 
chocolate, taking into consideration national 
legislation and local requirements, we will provide 
our consumers with clear calorie per piece labelling 
compatibly with availability of space on packaging.
We believe that with calorie per piece as a 
reference we provide clear information to our 
consumers to calculate and decide how many 
pieces they can consume based on their daily 
dietary intake. Depending on the local legal 
framework the calorie per piece information  
is also supplemented with the nutritional 
information per 100g.
With the exception of very small packaging like 
mono-pieces and single lollipops, where there is  
no space available, we commit that all our sugar 
based candies and chocolate will visibly feature  
the calorie information per piece:
 • candy and chocolate bags above 10g will 
feature front-of-pack calorie labelling;
 • other pack types (boxes, sticks, rolls) will  
feature the calorie information as visibly  
as possible, either on front of pack or close  
to the ingredient list in a visible way;
 • lollipops packed in a bag or a flowpack will 
feature front-of-pack calorie labelling. 
The existing candy and chocolate packs lacking 
calorie information will be gradually changed  
over the next five years so that all our sugar 
based products worldwide will be aligned  
with this commitment. 
For all new sugar 
based candies, 
lollipops and chocolate, 
we will provide our 
consumers with clear 
calorie per piece 
labelling, compatibly 
with availability of 
space on packaging.

2.  Wide range of sugar based, sugar free  
and sugar reduced products 
We offer our consumers a wide product range 
from sugar based products to sugar free and sugar 
reduced options. In particular, for all our global 
brands (Mentos, Chupa Chups, Alpenliebe and 
Fruittella), we commit to offer a sugar free or sugar 
reduced variant next to sugar based products 
in the coming five years.
Most of our chewing gum portfolio is sugar free. 
Chewing sugar free gum is beneficial for oral 
hygiene. Four health claims specific to sugar free 
gum backed by science were recognised and 
accepted by the European Commission in 2012. 
The FDI World Dental Federation and numerous 
national dental associations around the world  
have also recognised that chewing sugar free 
gum supports dental health. Chewing sugar free  
gum contributes to the maintenance of tooth 
mineralisation, the neutralisation of plaque 
acids and the reduction of oral dryness.
In 2016, the sugar free portfolio of our assortment 
contributed to 32% of our net sales. Compared to 
2015, this is a growth of 3%. We intend to further 
grow the sugar free portfolio while always keeping 
in mind that ‘offering a choice to consumers’ is 
our goal. 
In 2016, we launched our reduced sugar 
Fruittella candy in the United Kingdom. This will 
be launched in the Netherlands in 2017 . Reduced 
sugar Fruittella is a delicious fruity candy with 30% 
less sugar which delivers 350 (kcal) calories per 
100g vs a standard Fruittella candy that delivers 
400 (kcal) calories.
3.  Products in smaller and resealable packs  
and single portions
We believe that the confectionery industry has  
a role to play in offering consumers more options 
including smaller packs that help consumers  
enjoy our treats in moderation and do not 
provide stimulus for overconsumption.
Our smaller packs, single portion and re-sealable 
packs such as Mentos Mini, Fruittella Dummy and 
Alpenliebe pillow-packs have been part of our 
product portfolio for a long time. In 2016, around 
26% of our revenue came from products sold in 
pack sizes less than 30g. 
 
For all our global 
brands (Mentos, 
Chupa Chups, 
Alpenliebe and 
Fruittella), we commit 
to offer a sugar free or 
sugar reduced choice 
variant next to sugar 
based products in the 
coming five years.

Our position on ingredients
At PVM we produce delicious 
confectionery treats for our 
consumers worldwide, using high 
quality, safe and healthy ingredients. 
We are convinced that health and 
indulgence can co-exist and we 
aim to provide our consumers with 
products that combine gratification 
and pleasure with health attributes. 
Consumers are increasingly health 
conscious and food-savvy and 
prioritise natural ingredients in their 
food choices. This section describes 
our position and practices on the use 
of colouring and Genetically Modified 
Organisms (GMO).
Food colouring
Artificial colours approved as food additives by the 
national and international food safety institutions  
do not pose risks to consumers’ health but have 
often been a cause for concern, especially in terms 
of exposure to children. Although confectionery  
is considered an occasional treat, we consider  
it a priority to ensure that our consumers are not 
exposed to any risk when consuming our products. 
We therefore strive to adopt the best possible 
available solutions in line with food legislation and 
indications from scientific institutions and health 
authorities to ensure the safety of colourings used 
in our products, minimise and avoid the use of 
artificial colourings where possible.
Our Group R&D and Group Marketing are 
responsible for managing our commitments with 
support from the Regulatory department to ensure 
we comply with all the relevant food regulations.
Some scientific studies linked specific artificial 
colourings (Southampton list colours and the so 
called azo colours) to possible health effects such 
as hyperactivity in children. These colours are all 
permitted by food legislation. Nevertheless, as part 
of our commitment to meet evolving consumer 
preferences over the last few years, we began 
reformulating various recipes to remove the use 
of artificial colourings and we will continue to do 
so. Our Fruittella brand is already predominantly 
free from artificial colours globally.
We have committed to the following:
1. For new product developments of local and 
global brands, we will work with our suppliers  
to identify available natural alternatives and  
use non-artificial colourings where feasible. 
2. In 2016, we committed to reformulating existing 
products with the purpose of switching to 
non-artificial colour alternatives. This process 
will take several years because of the 
complexity of the task to maintain the same 
product appeal, quality standards and food 
safety levels as well as the large number  
of products involved in the reformulation 
process at global level. 
3. We have also begun to completely remove 
titanium dioxide (an approved colour additive 
used in a variety of applications, including food, 
to impart white colour) from all product recipes 
worldwide and we will stop using titanium 
dioxide in production during 2018.
GMOs
GMO stands for genetically modified organism. 
Genetically Modified (GM) foods are made from 
soy, corn, or other crops grown from seeds with 
genetically engineered DNA. Genetic engineering  
is a relatively new technique and research linked to 
the long-term health effects of GM foods is limited. 
GMO is widely used and generally accepted in the 
Americas whereas in other parts of the world a 
more precautionary approach is taken towards 
the usage of GMO in foods. 
In 2016, we defined a Policy at Group level: all PVM 
products sold outside of the Americas are GMO 
free. In the Americas we strive to find GMO free 
alternatives for the raw materials which are not 
GMO free.
 
Today all our products sold in Europe are GMO 
free and we are putting in place action plans 
to meet the requirements of the GMO Policy 
in other parts of the world.
In 2016, we established a system where all raw 
material information, including GMO usage, will 
be collected on a global basis. By the end of 2017, 
we will have a clear overview on the use of GMO 
that will provide insights for planning our future 
targets and actions.
For new product 
developments of local 
and global brands, 
we will identify available 
natural alternatives 
and use non-artificial 
colourings. We will 
gradually reformulate 
existing products 
to non-artificial 
color alternatives. 26

Making it easier for consumers 
to make the right choice
“We consider our consumers to be very smart  
and health conscious in their choices. Our product 
range offers tasty product solutions for all kinds of 
needs, going from sugar-based jellies to reduced 
sugar/sugar-free candies and sugar-free gums 
with various health benefits. 
In our efforts to help our consumers make the right 
choice, we have gone one step further: in addition 
to giving them an ample range to choose from, we 
want to help them to clearly understand the actual 
calorie intake they are adding to their diet when 
consuming our candies. I feel that we at PVM have 
taken a very innovative and smart commitment.
Consumers will soon find a clear logo on our 
labels telling them how many ‘calories per piece’. 
This way we are not defining a portion size that 
should fit all consumers. Indeed, we are giving 
our consumers a straightforward and basic piece 
of information that allows them to easily establish 
the number of candies they can consume based 
on their lifestyle and dietary needs.
Just providing nutritional information per 100g as 
required by law, is not enough for consumers, as it 
can be difficult for them to quantify the number of 
pieces. “Calories per piece” is a very friendly way  
of providing nutritional information and I feel that 
PVM will set the example in our category.”

Limiting our carbon footprint
We are committed to reducing our 
impact on the environment. We wish 
to create and maintain competitive 
operations, with a long-term 
sustainable future. To do that, we 
focus on reducing energy and water 
consumption, limiting waste and 
atmosphere emissions from our 
manufacturing locations, reducing 
packaging material and our carbon 
footprint, adopting renewable energy 
sources wherever possible and 
obtaining ISO 14001 certification. 
Ownership alongside ‘Good 
housekeeping’ (GHK) are fundamental 
elements and have continuously been 
our focus. We motivate employees  
at every level of the organisation 
to respect the environment and 
encourage them to apply the 
same in their private life.
Environmental management
In 2016, 14 Manufacturing Operating Companies 
were ISO14001 certified and we target to get all 
Manufacturing Operating Companies certified 
by end 2018. Full details provided in Chapter 1. 
The management team of the manufacturing 
location is responsible for managing environmental 
issues and they are supported by the Safety, 
Health, Environment & Risk (SHE&R) functions. 
All Manufacturing Operating Companies are 
reporting non-financial KPIs monthly. Data for the 
following environmental KPIs are collected: waste 
disposed (product and non-product related), CO 2 
emissions, water consumption, water discharged 
and water effluent specifications.
Carbon footprint
All manufacturing, logistics activities and related 
processes use energy obtained from resources 
such as carbon coal, natural gas, liquefied petrol 
gas, diesel fuel oil, biomass, electricity from the 
public grids and solar power. 
In order to reduce the environmental impact 
derived from the use of energy, we have 
implemented initiatives with the intention 
of generating operational savings and 
improving energy efficiency. Examples  
of our initiatives include:
 • In all our Manufacturing Operating Companies 
we emphasise the importance of “Production 
right first time”. We encourage all employees  
to identify waste prevention and reduction 
opportunities and sort the waste for recycling.  
In the Netherlands, incineration of residual 
waste has led to “zero waste to land fill”; the 
remaining ashes end up being used as filler 
in aggregated form for road construction. 
 • We have invested in energy monitoring  
systems. Such systems enable us to track the 
performance of our production processes. 
Some installations have been connected to the 
existing building management system to allow 
better monitoring and adjustment of air handling 
systems/steam boilers/cooling machines in 
particular. The extra insight gained resulted in 
further savings attributing to the adjustment of 
various controls. In production facilities, these 
instruments are piloted and deployed, the key 
learnings are used to develop systems for 
broader roll out.
 • We have Effluent Treatment Plants in nine 
Manufacturing Operating Companies that 
generate biogas. This helped us to reduce  
our consumption of natural resources to 
generate energy. In 2016, our production facility 
in Breda achieved 7% reduction in our local  
gas requirement. We will continue to focus on 
evaluating the feasibility of using self-generated 
biogas and implementing energy reduction 
initiatives in all our facilities. In St. Petersburg-
Russia, Toluca-Mexico and Vinhedo-Brazil, the 
effluent treatment plants are in the final phase 
of design and expected to be installed in  
the coming years.

Limiting our carbon footprint
continued
Our Manufacturing Operating Companies in India, 
Indonesia, Italy, Russia and Nigeria have installed 
Co-generation and Tri-generation plants that 
use the energy in a more efficient way for our 
operations. The energy from residual heat from  
our processes and power generation plants is 
used to fire vapour absorption plants to generate 
chilled water deployed for processing activities  
and building management systems in air treatment 
units. In our production facilities in Moscow, 
Russia, the complete production plant, offices  
and on-site warehouse is 100% serviced by the 
residual heat from three co-generations plants 
generating electricity.
 • We limit our carbon footprint through the use  
of LED lighting in all Manufacturing Operating 
Companies. For example, all lighting in our 
Shenzhen production facility has been  
changed to LED lighting. 
 • In Sri Lanka, briquette (biomass) is used as a 
fuel oil alternate in the boiler system to generate 
the steam. The CO2 emission of briquette is  
45 times lower compared to fuel oil.
 • We achieved a 1.2% local gas reduction through 
the use of solar energy in our production facility 
in Breda, Netherlands. We are evaluating the 
feasibility of extending the use of solar energy in 
other Manufacturing Operating Companies and 
the use of other sustainable energy sources.
Using 2016 as the base year, we are monitoring our 
energy consumption and carbon footprint in order 
to formulate our targets more specifically and 
implement further actions to reduce our impact.

As we constantly raise awareness of the direct 
and indirect impact that our actions can have 
on the environment, we pursue a strategy to 
monitor the environmental impact of our 
manufacturing operations. We are collecting 
standardised performance indicators and data in all 
manufacturing locations based on the Greenhouse 
Gas Protocol and conversion factors provided by 
local governmental emission standards or local 
energy suppliers. Our Scope 1 emissions are 
calculated with an additional 5% to account for 
emission leakages. Going forward, by January 
2019 each Manufacturing Operating Company 
will have an Environmental Master Plan (EMP).
In addition to reducing our carbon footprint, we 
are also working to reduce our water consumption 
through the implementation of efficient cleaning 
procedures, the recycling of water and good 
housekeeping, process optimisation, behavioural 
change of employees, the implementation of 
‘dry’ systems and recycling of residual water. 
The good housekeeping plan at our production 
facility in Vinhedo-Brazil resulted in 50% water 
intake reduction.

Reducing packaging
Our packaging requires the combination of 
quality for our consumers whilst considering the 
environmental impact. PVM aims to deliver optimal 
packaging solutions that protect the product on its 
way to the end user with the least environmental 
impact and fit to purpose usage of packaging 
and related waste and emissions.
Lately, we have completed studies and activities 
delivering sustainable action plans, including: 
i.  Weight reduction of key bottle formats, resulting 
in 80,000 kg less plastic used on a yearly 
basis from mid-2017 
ii.  Multiple global activities optimising material 
structures and quantities used
Going for an even more holistic and global 
approach to the entire packaging system from 
sourcing to end of life in 2017, Group R&D will:
1. Set up internal packaging sustainable  
forum to better address and prioritise 
sustainable activities
2. Focus on a more structured evaluation  
of sustainability in our packaging impact
3. Optimise the weight and volume of our 
packaging in overall product life cycle
4. Develop more fit-for-purpose packaging 
solutions
5. Invest in research in alternative technologies  
to reduce environmental impact
The challenge of sustainable manufacturing
In “Our Quest for the Best” in manufacturing 
Perfetti Van Melle, like any other company, is facing 
the challenge of reaching the point of sustainability  
for the long term. This highly ambitious target 
however is an important driver in all our activities  
to continuously evaluate how we are doing things 
today and how we can we do things different and 
better tomorrow. We embrace the Perfetti Van 
Melle values, People-Planet-Profit, in the way we’re 
conducting our daily activities in our business.
Perfetti Van Melle is making efforts to reduce its 
impact. In our daily manufacturing activities, we’re 
continuously looking to improve processes making 
them as efficient as possible, where the principles 
“right first time” and “good housekeeping” are 
deployed across the organisation. With LEAN 
manufacturing concepts, education and industrial 
investments, Perfetti Van Melle is providing all the 
instruments in working towards sustainability for the 
long term. Upcoming new technologies like SMART 
Industry 4.0 will help making even bigger steps 
in operational improvements, embracing this 
roadmap will guide us in digitising the shop floor 
achieving higher levels of operational excellence 
such as maximising the reduction of energy 
resources usage.
To show our ambition that we want to make 
steps in reducing our impact, we need to make 
responsible choices for all stakeholders and setting 
the right priorities also considering the available 
resources. “What is our commitment and what 
we’ve achieved”, as depicted in the table to the 
left, is the ambition we have. As such we continue 
with persistent efforts chasing our goals in our  
“Quest for the best”.

We are very much aware of the 
importance of the quality of the 
connection we make with the 
communities we operate in. We 
depend on them in many ways: 
we hire our employees from local 
communities, we need local licences 
and community endorsement to 
operate, we use community

Our impact on local communities
continued
Our Manufacturing Operating Companies have 
always applied their own local practices to connect 
with the local communities they operate in. Out 
of the 15 countries with manufacturing presence, 
12 connected with their communities in 2016. 
China and Vietnam conducted initiatives in previous 
years and will report their efforts next year. Our 
operations in Nigeria have only been operational 
since 2015 and will define community plans in the 
near future. There is enormous diversity in the 
maturity of the policies and practices in place. Our 
operations in Spain, Sri Lanka and The Netherlands 
have a community investment policy while our 
operations in the USA, Brazil and Italy have 
a history of organising annual events. The 
remaining Manufacturing Operating Companies 
apply an ad-hoc approach to connect with 
their local community. 
Local community initiatives are currently managed 
by different departments in each Manufacturing 
Operating Company with the Human Resource 
department most frequently driving these initiatives. 
The causes that we support and the community 
initiatives that we implement are determined 
by employees’ suggestions, requests from 
communities, requests from local governments  
or our assessment of community needs. The 
success of our ‘Living in our Communities’ 
initiatives is measured with several indicators 
across the Group that differ per country.
 
In Italy, we support local economic, social, scientific 
and cultural causes in different ways. On a regular 
basis, we provide work for a local social cooperative 
that employs people with disabilities. The cooperative 
provides co-packer services. In 2016, we assigned 
€18,000 worth of packing activities to them. We 
regularly support clinical and experimental scientific 
research related to health and safety of ingredients 
at Istituto Mario Negri, a key Italian independent 
and world-renowned research centre. In 2016 
we donated €100,000 to support their research. 
Provided below is a snapshot of social and 
cultural projects supported in Italy in 2016:
 • Ape Operosa Onlus: volunteers of this 
organisation help people living in poor 
conditions by providing workmen to carry  
out small maintenance job and decoration; 
 • We support the musical performance for the 
Corpo Musicale Giuseppe Verdi, the town 
marching band;
 • We contributed €10,000 to purchasing a 
specially designed mini-van for the transport  
of disabled people;
 • A “Green Day” in cooperation with the local 
Council where our employees cleaned a 
woodland close to our production facility;
 • 2-day ‘open production facility’ event for the 
local community to come and explore and 
engage with us.
In Turkey, nine employees coached 35 vocational 
High School Students to prepare them for 
professional careers. We support increasing 
awareness about gender equality and specifically 
we support women between 20-40 to boost their 
self-confidence and personal development through 
encouraging women to play sports. We sponsor 
the “Benim Ístanbul’ um” lecture that addresses 
up to 250 students per year. The lecture combines 
cultural, experimental and historical elements to 
offer students a different perspective.
In the USA, we support many organisations 
throughout the year. Our support is given in the 
form of donated product, time and monetary funds. 
We have one major event each year where we shut 
down production and close our offices. All of our 
employees spend the day volunteering at several 
inner-city schools or working in The Giving Fields. 
At The Giving Fields, we harvest vegetables that 
are donated to the local food pantry. The food 
pantry provides meals to families who are 
homeless or cannot afford to provide meals for 
their loved ones. At the schools, we paint and 
repair playgrounds that provide a safe environment 
for the children in the community. In 2016, at our 
All Company Meeting, as a team building exercise, 
employees built 45 bikes to donate to a local Boys 
and Girls Club, a national organisation that provides 
supervised after-school activities for children. In 
2016, we contributed approximately €45,800 to 
community initiatives and 3,540 volunteering hours.
In the USA, we have also committed to forming 
a committee and standardising our policies and 
procedures as it relates to charitable organisations.

In The Netherlands , CSR is well-embedded in the 
organisation. We have a policy in The Netherlands 
where each department receives an annual budget 
of €35 per employee for a team activity. If the team 
activity is CSR related, the budget increases by 
€10 per person and the activity can be organised 
during working hours. This policy increases the 
awareness on CSR among our employees.
We have a tradition where every year around 
120 employees spend half a day supporting a 
community initiative. In 2016, an Elementary school 
for special education “Het Kasteel” in Breda was 
selected. At this school, special needs children 
aged 5–12 receive education, support, therapy and 
care. Our employees made the outside area of the 
school “spring proof” by emptying and filling all 
sandboxes, creating special cultivation tables for 
children in wheelchairs, painting walls and doors  
in a special “castle style”, installing a new kitchen 
and building a special “castle” fence. 80 children 
spent time with us painting, dancing, playing 
music, hockey and football. 
In Russia, we supported the Russian public charity 
foundation “Russian Children’s Fund” both with 
products and with the support of our employees. 
The main purpose of the foundation is to raise 
voluntary contributions and donations to provide 
special assistance to orphans, children left without 
parental care, disabled children, as well as Russian 
children and children from other countries affected 
by wars, inter-ethnic conflicts, natural disasters 
and epidemics. The Foundation promotes the 
protection of motherhood, childhood and paternity. 
Several of our employees helped during working 
hours to prepare gifts for over 3,000 children. We 
provided candies to boost the 3,000 presents this 
foundation gave to children during New Year and 
other public holidays.
In India, we developed initiatives in the local 
community for the purpose of building awareness 
and giving a better lifestyle to the under-privileged. 
The initiatives promote education on safety, 
healthcare, safe drinking water to all and 
environmental awareness and the eradication  
of poverty, hunger and malnutrition. The Heads 
of Human Resource of each production facility 
identify the local community needs and 
requirements for each respective location.  
During working hours, each Head of Human 
Resource together with two employees performed 
a large variety of community initiatives. The outputs 
of these initiatives were not measured however in 
2016, €160,000 cash and in-kind donation valued 
at €4,750 were donated to various schools.
In Sri Lanka, we ran three major community 
initiatives. One of these was the renovation of 
the Ministry of Women & Child Affairs approved 
children’s home ‘MAHOSU’ which is 4km away 
from our production facility. We provided support 
to improve the living standard of children by 
improving the infrastructure of the children’s 
home. €1,500 of in-kind value was donated and 
our employees spent 112 working hours and 200 
non-working hours. This initiative significantly 
improved the living standards and the comfort 
of these children.
 
In Bangladesh, our production facility is located 
in an area where many social needs exist. We 
identified the two local schools to support the 
Beraiderchala Govt. Primary School and the 
Gilarchala Govt. Primary School. We found both 
schools to have a large number of students and 
a shortage of teacher’s which hampered their 
progress. There is also a lack of furniture, fans and 
books. We supported the schools by providing 
three additional teachers with a monthly salary  
and by providing furniture, fans and drinking water. 
We also organised a ‘Free Health Camp’ on 
our premises every quarter. We provide medical 
prescription, medicine and health advice to 
children, women and the elderly in those camps. 
These medical facilities are rendered by certified 
male and female medical practitioners. 
In 2016, our total contribution totalled €8,000. 
Three to four employees spent 6-8 hours per 
month coordinating these activities. These 
initiatives were initiated by the Managing Director. 
The production facility’s Human Resource team 
identified the schools’ needs by visiting the schools 
and discussing the findings with the school 
authority. The initiatives supported our role in the 
community by demonstrating PVM is a people-
oriented company and that we play a part in 
improving people’s lives.
In Indonesia, community initiatives are organised by 
the CSR team which consists of representatives from 
various departments. In 2016, we partnered with the 
Indonesian Red Cross Organisation and the National 
Anti-Narcotics Agency. Initiatives included blood 
donation, socialisation/prevention of drug abuse 
to junior/high school students, health talk to local 
communities and schools, supporting child nutrition 
at the “Community Integrated Health Centre” in 
Posyandu (a community self-reliance health centre in 
villages for mothers and children and dental care for 
students at local elementary school and computer 
donation to a village local government and 
elementary/high schools in our company’s 
surroundings). In 2016, our cash donation amounted 
to €4,500. Small amounts of candy are donated 
in each event. Our community initiatives increase 
the acceptance of our company as a responsible 
business. It also raises awareness and strengthens 
the relationship with the local community.

In Mexico, our employees worked with World Vision 
to build four farms to create a sustainable food 
supply for families and children. We sponsored a 
small amount and donated several goods in-kind. 
12 employees worked for eight hours with World 
Vision and based on this success we agreed to 
develop more initiatives with the NGO. 
In Brazil, a government initiative allows companies 
to donate part of their annual taxes to NGO 
projects instead of paying taxes to the government, 
thus promoting charity support at no additional 
costs. PVM Brazil is supporting two projects: 
Instituto Gerardo Falcoes in São Paulo, an 
organization that helps children in poor 
neighbourhoods to develop their talent through 
music and arts, preventing them from ending up 
in gangs or using drugs. Our one time Euro 22,000 
contribution helped paying teachers and provide 
additional support to the project such as 
psychologists, infrastructure, and materials. 
The second project is Associacao Paraliolimpica  
in Campinas that helps and trains people with 
physical disabilities to swim professionally with the 
aim to compete in the Paralympics. Our one time 
Euro 5,000 contribution helped to pay trainers and 
maintain the swimming pool in good conditions.
In Spain, we have one of the most sophisticated 
policies with regard to the way we connect 
with society. In 2016, our contribution towards 
community initiatives totalled €60,000 spent

additional cash donation from PVM totalling €2,000 
for Fundación Theodora for its Planta initiative: 
“With your contribution, you have enabled more 
children and teenagers in hospital to receive visits 
from DOCTORES SONRISA”. 
Another initiative is the ‘Recicla Cultura’ (cultural

mobilisation campaign to promote literacy among 
people at risk of social exclusion. Employees 
donated second hand books that were then 
distributed among the underprivileged.

turnover of €46 million. Look-O-Look is a candy 
wholesaler and confectionery concept specialist. 
Candy is sold direct or via distributors in many 
countries around the world. The business goals are 
high customer centricity, innovation and flexibility. 
Look-O-Look is BRC, IFS, FSSC22000, SA8000 
and ISO14001 certified. 
For more than 20 years Look-O-Look has worked 
together with four social working places in The 
Netherlands. As a result, around 850 disabled 
people re-packed a part of Look-O-Look products. 
One of the social working places is Weener XL. 
In 2008 Look-O-Look set up a partnership with 
Weener XL, a labour development organisation  
of the Municipality of ’s-Hertogenbosch. This 
organisation finds employment for inhabitants  
of the city who are not able to participate in the 
regular labour market. For this target group, 
suitable work and participation are key.
Together with Weener XL, Look-O-Look has 
created meaningful activities whereby their 
employees produce Look-O-Look popular 
products like the Candy Pizza. Weener XL workers 
earn additional income on top of social security 
payments. Look-O-Look’s production is completed 
close to the Look-O-Look production facility at 
a good price and Weener XL offer meaningful  
and paid employment to a group of citizens who 
otherwise would have difficulty finding work. 
In 2016 Kees de Waard and Adrie Gerritsen, 
Managing Director of PVM Benelux and 
Look-O-Look respectively, signed a further 
three-year contract with Weener XL on 
behalf of Look-O-Look.
The future
Moving forward we intend to consolidate and 
focus our efforts around a common global theme 
that is aligned with our Mission and Values. Our 
Operating Companies will continue to have the 
autonomy to plan and implement community 
initiatives. This allows us to maximise our impact 
on the communities when our common global 
theme is applied locally. 
The future of community investment
Only some of our Operating Companies 
measure the value of their cash and in-kind 
donations, the number of employees 
involved and the hours they have spent 
on the initiatives. For 2017 , our ambition 
will be to define three indicators:
1. Total amount of money invested 
in the community initiatives – both  
in cash and in kind;
2. Overall number of employees involved  
in the community initiatives;
3. Total number of working hours invested 
on the initiatives. 
We are looking into the option of an 
‘umbrella-theme’ for our community 
investment activities and are considering 
choosing one theme and inviting local 
companies to fill this in their own way and 
learning from each other to see which 
project has the most impact. At the same 
time, we do not want to take the energy 
out of the local initiatives. Initiatives that are 
invented close to the ground, have higher 
commitment. For now, no decision is taken 
on the way forward and we cherish the 
energy all of this brings to our organisation.

Reducing the environmental and social impact in the supply chain
Globally, the estimated total number 
of suppliers is 1,400 suppliers which 
consists of 800 Packaging Material 
(PM) suppliers, 600 Raw Material 
(RM) suppliers, and 10 Distributors 
that supply both Raw Material and 
Packaging Material. Our top Raw 
Materials procured are sugars, 
glucose, flavours, polyols and 
mono-polysaccharide, whereas our 
top Packaging Materials procured 
are flexible plastic, rigid plastic, 
corrugated board and paper board.
PVM Code of Conduct
We require our suppliers to sign PVM 
CoC which covers social and environmental 
responsibility. We commit to operate safely 
and responsibly, with sound environmental 
practices aimed at minimising our impact on 
the environment. When we select suppliers, 
we take into consideration their commitment 
to environmental and social responsibility. 
When suppliers sign our CoC, they agree 
to comply with all the laws applicable to anti-
corruption and anti-bribery regulations. The  
CoC also dictates that no children can be 
employed in a supplier’s organisation and that 
all the relevant regulation in terms of employee’s 
safety, remuneration – social security contribution  
included – and management are duly applied. 
Palm Oil 
Whilst palm oil is not widely used in our products, 
we decided to eliminate palm oil and derivatives 
from our recipes wherever possible and in all other 
cases within the coming year only RSPO MB 
(Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil Mass 
Balance) certified oil will be used.
Reducing our environmental impact
We’re committed to reducing the environmental 
impact of our distribution operations and have 
implemented the following initiatives: 
We aim to manufacture our products close to our 
sales markets whenever possible. Our objective  
is to minimise imports and exports, reducing  
the environmental impact and waste of energy 
involved in transporting goods. 
Whenever possible, we also make significant use of 
combined road/rail transport, both for imports and 
for domestic distribution. For exporting to distant 
markets we prefer to use shipping, thus helping 
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
With new regular transportation routes, we 
consistently increase Intermodal weight achieving 
above 95% on all our transport from Spain to 
Benelux, Spain to United Kingdom, Istanbul to 
Benelux and Istanbul to United Kingdom. As 
a result, we reduced 1.065 tonnes of CO2 
equivalent emissions in 2016.
As part of our target to allocate our production 
closer to the final market of Italy, we brought our 
Gum Bottle production from Turkey to France 
reducing the distance by 85%.
Our production facilities in China have worked 
on a logistics project reducing the mode of 
transportation from road to more rail and shipping 
resulting in a reduction of 8,045,617L of diesel 
consumption and 21,160 tonnes of reduction 
of CO2 equivalent emission.
The future
We recognise the impact that our actions have 
on society at large and the environment. We are in 
the process of establishing a Global Procurement 
function that will put in place a strategy and action 
plan, not just for us as a company but also for 
our key partners, to minimise our impact. In 
2017 we will set clear and realistic goals with 
a specific roadmap.
Our Group Quality Policy requires each supplier  
of raw materials and packaging materials as well 
as co-packers and co-producers of finished goods  
to have at least one GFSI recognised food safety 
certificate by January 2018. This is the first step 
in guaranteeing a global quality and food safety 
standard throughout our supply chain. This  
policy will then be further extended to include 
Environment, Social Ethical and Health & Safety 
certification requirements for our suppliers. In  
2017, we will set targets and chart a roadmap 
to achieve this.

Aligning our production facilities and suppliers 
with globally recognised standards
“Having spent 20 years in R&D and Quality in 
various countries I’ve had the opportunity to deeply 
interact with a huge number of suppliers across 
the globe and also to visit and audit their facilities. 
Local cultures and circumstances need to be 
understood and respected when it comes to the 
evaluation and approval of suppliers, but PVM is 
demanding that all business partners respect  
and follow standards.
Over recent years our Group Quality team  
has implemented a global certification policy, 
guaranteeing the strict alignment of all our 
production facilities to globally recognised 
standards. The most critical standards are 
becoming a mandatory requirement for some  
of our suppliers, and we will increase these 
requirements in the coming years to a wider range 
of standards and a wider range of suppliers.”
Martin Walzl
Chief R&D Officer
