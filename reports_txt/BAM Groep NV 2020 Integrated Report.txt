Message 
from the CEO
Message from the CEO
BAM’s results in the past year do not reflect the underlying 
potential of the Group. Especially, Covid-19 has been a cloud over 
our markets, businesses, clients and colleagues in 2020, and 
continues to drive uncertainty in our markets. I am really 
impressed with how our people have responded to the challenge 
by adapting our operations, preserving our resilience and 
supporting our communities. 
BAM’s adjusted result before tax for the year 2020 was 
€34.3 million (2019: €74.1 million). The adjusted pre-tax 
margin was 0.5 per cent (2019: 1.0 per cent). The overall 
order book was €13,800 million at year-end 2020 
(year-end 2019: €12,659 million).
From an operational perspective, our activities in Dutch 
Construction and Property and BAM PPP contributed well in 2020. 
In our other businesses, there is clearly room for improvement. 
The additional loss by BAM International was disappointing. 
In July 2020, BAM decided to wind down the operating company 
BAM International, active outside our European markets, given 
the lack of a positive outlook. This wind-down and the Cologne 
metro settlement resulted in a significant improvement of BAM’s 
risk profile.
In December, we announced the extension of our partnership with 
PGGM. PGGM Infrastructure Fund has acquired a 50 per cent 
interest in BAM PPP. We were pleased to announce  this important 
milestone, which will deliver accelerated growth benefiting both 
shareholders. BAM PPP will continue to work closely with its BAM 
sister companies to offer our clients the best whole-life solutions. 
The expertise and global networks of both organisations will also 
support the development of new investment opportunities.
We are on track with our cost reduction programme, announced 
at the end of September, with a target of €100 million annually. 
Although the necessity is widely accepted, for many of our staff it 
has been (and for some it still is) an uncertain period. 
This integrated report illustrates positive developments in areas 
such as digital construction, innovation and sustainability. BAM’s 
inclusion in CDP’s Climate A list (Carbon Disclosure Project,
January 2021) is again a recognition of our efforts to reduce 
emissions and to achieve a net-positive impact.
Ensuring a safe working environment remains our top priority. It is 
very regrettable that in 2020 a long-standing colleague died in an 
accident at a BAM site, and our thoughts are with his family.
BAM recognises and values the benefits that diversity brings. In 
2020, BAM appointed women managing directors at two 
operating companies, BAM Infra Nederland and BAM Interbuild.
Since my appointment as CEO on 1 September, we have started to 
define our new strategic agenda in order to create more value for 
our shareholders and solid prospects for all our stakeholders,
including our employees.
Under our new strategy for 2021-2023, ‘Building a sustainable 
tomorrow’, the Group will restructure its portfolio of businesses 
to focus on markets and projects where it can leverage its proven 
competitive strengths and serve the growing demand for 
sustainable solutions in the construction sector, while 
substantially lowering our projects’ risk profile. Serving all our 
stakeholders – employees, clients, partners, suppliers and the 
communities in which we do business – BAM will structurally 
improve the profitability and predictability of the Group as a 
client- and service-driven business. 
When visiting some of BAM’s projects, I saw that our teams are 
well-prepared and extremely motivated. BAM is a company with 
good capabilities and much potential.
I therefore firmly believe that our strategy for success will provide 
the basis, not only for the restoration of profit and cash 
conversion, but also serve as a foundation to play a leading role in 
the construction industry in the years to come. I look forward to 
working closely with my colleagues to achieve this ambition.
BAM will provide its outlook for 2021 in due course.
Finally, also on behalf of the Executive Committee, I would like to 
thank all our stakeholders for their confidence in BAM. I would like 
to especially thank our employees for their hard work and 
commitment to serve our clients.

Organisation
BAM is a large European construction firm with operating 
companies active in two business lines, Construction and 
Property and Civil engineering, as well as in public-private 
partnerships. The Company employs approximately 17,966 
people.
BAM’s activities are in five European home markets: the 
Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Ireland and 
Germany. The Company also has a presence in Denmark, 
Luxembourg and Switzerland.
In July 2020, BAM announced it would wind down the operating 
company BAM International, active outside the Company’s 
European markets, given the lack of a positive outlook.   
Construction and Property
BAM carries out non-residential construction activities in all its
home markets and also in Switzerland and Denmark. In
addition, BAM delivers residential construction projects 
(apartment buildings) primarily in the Netherlands and Belgium. 
Family homes are developed and built mainly in the Netherlands, 
where development and construction is provided as a fully
integrated solution to clients.
Non-residential property development activities are carried out
in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Belgium.
The business line Construction and Property employs 
approximately 7,765 people.
Civil engineering
The civil engineering activities cover all BAM’s home markets 
and also Denmark and Luxembourg. The business line Civil 
engineering employs approximately 9,806 people.
Public-private partnerships 
BAM is a well-respected player in the European market for
public-private partnership (PPP) projects. BAM PPP delivers 
construction and recurring maintenance revenue for both 
business lines, and operates concessions for roads, rail, 
education, health care and government buildings. BAM PPP 
employs approximately 100 people. On 23 December 2020 it was 
announced that PGGM Infrastructure Fund had acquired a 50 per 
cent interest in BAM PPP and that from 1 January 2021 BAM PPP 
would operate as a joint venture between Royal BAM Group and 
PGGM Infrastructure Fund.
BAM’s top structure
The Company’s top structure consists of two governing bodies: 
the Executive Committee and  the two-person Executive Board. 
The Executive Committee consists of the Executive Board 
members, the chief operating officers of both business lines, the 
chief business excellence officer and the chief human resources 
officer. The Executive Committee decides – with final 
responsibility lying with the Executive Board – on strategic issues 
and policies, based on input from the operating companies and 
staff departments. Each member has a clearly defined focus and 
responsibility.
The financial, social and environmental performance of BAM’s 
business lines are described in   chapter 3.

BAM’s value creation model is based on 
the International Integrated Reporting 
Council’s Integrated Reporting <IR> 
framework and gives an overview of how 
BAM creates value.
The cycle of integrated thinking and 
reporting supports financial and 
sustainability results. BAM discloses a 
combination of quantitative and 
qualitative information to describe how 
value is created.
What we do and how we create value 
People
Creating social value
BAM’s approach to sustainability delivers 
benefits to clients and communities in 
which the Group works. BAM aims to create 
a safe and more sustainable built 
environment. Within communities, the 
Company wants to positively enhance the 
lives of more than one million people by 
2020 by creating skills and learning 
opportunities and through voluntary and 
charitable work. BAM continues to target 
talent to maintain its position as one of the 
best companies to work for.
   For B AM’s social performance, see 
paragraph 3.2.
Profit
Creating financial value
Shareholders and financial institutions 
provide funds that BAM invests in its two 
business lines as well as in PPP, with a 
divestment strategy for a part of BAM’s 
current land bank and property 
investments. 
   For B AM’s financial performance, see 
paragraph 3.1.
Planet
Creating environmental value
BAM wants to mitigate the impact of its 
operations on climate change and 
resource consumption. The Company is 
working towards having a net positive 
impact by reducing carbon emissions and 
waste intensity, as well as by adopting 
circular business principles and 
implementing innovative solutions.
BAM works in close collaboration with its 
supply chain in achieving common goals 
and addressing global environmental 
challenges (see paragraph 3.2).
   For  BAM’s environmental performance, 
see paragraph 3.3.

Review strategic plan
In early 2016, BAM launched the strategy ‘Building the present, 
creating the future’. This strategy was based on three pillars (focus 
the project portfolio, shape the business portfolio and create the 
future portfolio ) supported by a foundation of differentiating 
capabilities and BAM’s unique culture. Based on this strategy, BAM 
set specific targets for financial (profit) and non-financial (people 
and planet) performance in the period 2016-2020.  
Although the Group delivered improvements in each of these 
areas, progress has been mixed across the different operating 
companies. In addition, there were operational challenges on 
some larger projects in the portfolio, mainly related to tenders 
awarded before the strategic period 2016-2020. Furthermore, 
the Group has faced some severe external headwinds during this 
period, most notably Covid-19 and new regulations in the 
Netherlands regarding nitrogen and PFAS.
As a result, the financial performance of the Group in 2016-2020 
has been disappointing and mainly below the goals set in 2016. 
For 2020, BAM did not achieve its targets for three of the four key 
financial indicators: adjusted result before tax margin, investment 
in land bank and property development and the capital ratio. The 
target of the fourth indicator, trade working capital efficiency, 
was met in 2020 and in four out of the five years altogether.
Progress in the areas of people and planet over the past five years 
has generally been more steady. BAM has worked hard to foster a 
strong safety leadership culture through continuous ‘Your Safety 
is My Safety’ campaigning. However, after two fatalities on BAM 
projects in 2019, regrettably BAM had to report one fatality in 
2020. BAM did not meet its general targets on the incident 
frequency (see page 27 - Incident frequency in 2020). Therefore, 
Your Safety is My Safety remains top priority for BAM. There is 
positive momentum on other important indicators such as 
investment in training, gender diversity, carbon emissions and 
resource efficiency and BAM managed to remain on the A-list of 
CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project).
Focus the project portfolio
As the first pillar of the strategy (‘Doing things better’), BAM 
developed a structural approach on tenders and projects under 
construction. For winning projects, the main drivers for 
performance improvement are either scale (cost leadership) or 
differentiation through specialisation (knowledge partnership). 
For complex projects, BAM uses its know-how, digital leadership, 
innovative drive and quality assurance as differentiating factors. 
The tender stage gate process has been implemented with a 
selective tendering policy and a start has been made on the 
implementation of the Uniform Project Approach. Unfortunately, 
the improvement seen in the vast majority of tenders and projects 
over the past five years was partly undermined by significant 
operational challenges at a limited number of projects, most of 
which had been awarded prior to the existing strategic period.
In 2020, there was a small number of underperforming projects, 
mainly within BAM International. This was one of the factors that 
led to the decision, announced in July 2020, to wind down 
BAM International.
Shape the business portfolio
The second pillar of the strategy has been to shape the business 
portfolio (‘Doing better things’) by supporting the operating 
companies in developing new propositions in the home markets as 
extensions of projects along the lifecycle and leveraging specialisms 
in international markets. At the same time, BAM looked to improve 
or exit from operational activities not offering enough opportunities 
to use scale or distinctiveness as critical success factors.
In 2020, BAM undertook a comprehensive analysis of product-
market combinations for its Construction and Property and Civil 
engineering business lines. This revealed several strategic choices 
to be made regarding in which home markets BAM can 
differentiate itself, which are the key differentiators and how to 
create more synergy in the portfolio. This analysis is a key 
component in formulating the new strategy for 2021-2023.
Also in 2020, BAM extended its long-term successful PPP 
partnership with Dutch pension provider PGGM when PGGM 
Infrastructure Fund acquired a 50 per cent interest in BAM PPP. 
This will generate significant potential for BAM PPP to accelerate 
growth in existing European and new global markets by 
providing BAM PPP with a broader remit and greater flexibility to 
expand its portfolio. At the same time, BAM PPP will continue to 
provide first-class services for its clients along the entire lifetime 
of the concession.
Create the future portfolio
In the third pillar of the strategy, BAM aimed to create its future 
portfolio (‘Doing new things’) by integrating digital construction 
solutions in its construction process and by accelerating 
innovative solutions for its clients. In the area of digital 
construction, BAM has invested in training with a strong focus on 
technology, processes and people and in digital tooling. All 
operating companies have advanced with the adoption of new 
digital construction techniques, and all BAM’s operating 
companies have been BIM level 2-certified. BAM has been 
nominated in the categorie ‘Digitale Bouwbedrijf 2020’ by Real 
Estate & Building Futureproof. The Digital Construction team in 
Ireland won the Irish Construction Excellence Award in 2020. 
In 2016, BAM set up a new funnel for innovations. In total, 69 
innovations have been considered as part of the process.  Of these 
69, approximately one third were terminated and two thirds are 
being followed up. The latter group includes 3D printing, Hardt 
Hyperloop, XBlocPlus, Dynamic Infrastructure & Mobility, Dutch 
Analytics and bio-based asphalt cleaning.

projects. Another major market trend is the substantial shortage 
of housing. These are areas where BAM has strong experience and 
expertise and is investing to expand its capabilities. 
Platform for growth
BAM will focus on growing its business  in the Netherlands, United 
Kingdom and Ireland. These are the markets where BAM has by far 
the largest scale. In these countries, BAM starts with top-three 
positions in both the Construction and Property (and the Civil 
engineering business lines and with a strong and growing position 
in Public Private Partnerships (PPP). 
In these markets, BAM will focus its portfolio, strive for business 
excellence and product leadership, and grow life-cycle solutions, 
providing clients with innovative and sustainable design, 
development, construction and facilities management solutions 
that can be integrated. 
BAM will prioritise projects where such innovation is replicable, in 
order to reduce risk and increase profitability. Examples include:
• Off
ering energy/climate-neutral residential concepts for 
new-build schemes and refurbishment programmes for social 
housing cooperatives;
• Rol
ling out sustainable lifecycle energy solutions for offices and 
homes (ESCos);
• Foc
using on two-stage tenders, framework agreements and 
repeat business. 
Managing for value
BAM’s activities in Germany and Belgium, markets where scale, risks 
and competitive dynamics have been more challenging, will be 
managed for value through further operational improvement actions 
and, potentially, divestments. BAM will be selective in its order intake 
while maintaining optimal services to clients, efficiency of operations 
and commitment to employee safety and development.
De-risking 
The strategic plan will specifically focus on improving BAM’s risk/
reward profile. As such, BAM will move its project portfolio away 
from large unrewarded risk by limiting the size of single-stage, 
lump-sum tenders in which it will participate in its Construction 
and Property and Civil engineering businesses to €150 million. 
Organisational commitment 
BAM’s new Executive Board has confidence that the Group, based 
on this strategic plan, can create greater and more sustainable 
value for its clients, employees, communities and investors. 
Tangible progress will be reported over the course of 2021.
Strategic plan: Building a sustainable tomorrow
Increased profitability and continued de-risking by focus on

2.4 Stakeholder engagement and material themes 
Suppliers and subcontractors
Supply chain partners are essential to BAM and therefore the 
Company engages with almost all of its suppliers. At projects, BAM 
is in constant dialogue with its suppliers about project expectations 
and the carbon footprint of supplied goods. In 2020, BAM engaged 
with suppliers to reduce the environmental impact of projects by 
implementing lifecycle assessments on product level. This is taking 
place throughout projects in both business lines. 
Society
By their nature, the construction and civil engineering works of 
BAM have an impact on local communities. BAM builds facilities 
which society needs, such as housing, hospitals, schools, leisure and 
industrial facilities, utilities and infrastructure. Discussion points 
differ per governmental body, but health and safety as well as 
human rights are common. Paragraph 3.2 of this report describes 
BAM’s performance and provides examples of its activities for 
social involvement in 2020. BAM’s programme on enhancing lives 
is an example of the Company’s ambition to increase its positive 
impact on local communities.
Regulators
By delivering projects, BAM is in constant contact with (local) 
government authorities about issuing permits, compliance with 
regulations and monitoring of activities. BAM is involved in many 
governmental initiatives including several Green Deals throughout 
Europe. The Group aims to engage regulators in issues such as 
health and safety management, carbon-free buildings, carbon 
impact in the infrastructure lifecycle and other sustainability-
related issues within the built environment. An example is 
platform CB23, which BAM joined in 2019, whose goal it is to 
develop and implement circular building regulations for the entire 
Dutch construction industry by 2023. In 2020, BAM engaged in 
different dialogue sessions to further develop an evident 
circularity framework.
Cross-sectoral collaboration
For BAM, stakeholder engagement is about transparency, a 
deeper understanding of requirements and expectations and, 
ideally, future-proof partnerships in the supply chain. During 
2020, BAM engaged in several stakeholder dialogues to address 
cross-industry trends and movements throughout the entire 
construction value chain, for example during yearly supplier days 
at different business units. In 2020, BAM engaged in discussions 
around the following themes: smart cities and mobility, circular 
economy, healthy urban living, lifecycle values, energy transition 
and digital construction. These themes are all societal challenges 
that no single party in the value chain can solve on its own. 
Tackling these challenges requires cross-sectoral collaboration, 
which can only be achieved if organisations and people from 
different sectors are willing and able to think, learn, 
communicate and collaborate across the boundaries that used to 
divide them.
Stakeholder engagement
BAM recognises that real business benefits can only be achieved by 
involving all stakeholders. BAM therefore continuously engages with 
its stakeholders in all home countries and throughout all operating 
companies to understand their priorities and concerns through 
benchmarking, sector meetings, client surveys and direct contacts. 
BAM’s stakeholders are interest groups which significantly 
influence or are influenced by the economic, environmental and 
social performance of the Company.
In 2020, Covid-19 restricted the Companies’ stakeholder 
engagement options, as large events in which stakeholders 
could be physically present were not possible. However, 
engagement activities did continue in smaller groups and 
through digital meetings. 
Clients
BAM is in constant dialogue with its clients about project 
expectations and projections. In addition, BAM organises client 
meetings to share knowledge and best practices. This is done 
through account management and business development at each 
operating company. Maximum value for money is of utmost 
importance to the clients and this extends beyond simply 
delivering a project at the lowest price. BAM tries to exceed clients’ 
sustainability expectations or to suggest an enhanced approach 
where none exists or where no targets have been set. Typically, 
this is done in the complex and multidisciplinary projects BAM 
undertakes.
Providers of financial capital
Communication with investors, financial institutions and the 
financial community at large is actively pursued and usually takes 
place through meetings, project visits, road shows, seminars, 
presentations, investment meetings and press releases. The main 
recurring topics of discussion are financial performance, 
transparency and control. Due to Covid-19 restrictions in 2020, 
engagement mostly took place through individual digital 
meetings. 
Employees
As part of the performance management process, personal 
learning and development plans of employees are evaluated 
annually between manager and employee. Progress to meet 
annual targets together with personal growth and career 
development are discussed. BAM has active works councils within 
its operating companies to discuss organisational changes and 
other employee-related matters. Employee engagement is 
facilitated through multiple platforms such as Young BAM events, 
open collaboration days, senior management meetings and online 
surveys through BAM Panel. BAM aims to share learnings from 
projects, inspire employees with new ideas and collect feedback 
on what can be improved (  pages 29-31).

Sustainable Development Goals
BAM values the alignment of its strategy with the UN-adopted 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): seventeen goals that 
serve as a roadmap to address the world’s biggest sustainability 
challenges and achieve a better and more sustainable future for all 
by 2030. BAM recognises the importance of the SDGs as a global 
agenda and believes it has a moral obligation to support these 
goals. BAM’s business potentially impacts all SDGs, but given the 
nature of its business, some have a more direct influence within 
current markets.
To that end BAM has identified seven goals that fit its strategy and 
impact best:
 3 –  Good health and well-being
 4 –  Qua
lity education
 8  –  Dec
ent work and economic growth
 9  –  Ind
ustry, innovation and infrastructure
11 –  Sus
tainable cities and communities
12 –  Res
ponsible production and consumption
13 –  Cli
mate action
The link between BAM’s performance indicators, material 
themes, risks and the SDGs is explained in figure 5.
Currently, BAM does not explicitly monitor its impact on the SDGs. 
Monitoring performance in relation to the SDGs requires an 
accurate insight in both the positive and negative impact of BAMs 
operations. Gaining detailed insight throughout the business is 
something BAM is not currently working on. 
Material themes
As part of the strategic agenda for 2016-2020, the Group carried 
out a materiality assessment in which 12 material themes were 
identified. Material themes significantly influence BAM’s ability to 
create value in the short, medium and long term. In order to be able 
to update the materiality matrix, BAM distributed an online survey 
to international stakeholders across all six stakeholder groups, 
selected with support from regional business development 
contacts to determine relevant stakeholders. A detailed description 
of the 12 material themes, their impact on BAM and the 
management approach can be found in paragraph 9.7. 
Materiality assessment
As in 2019, BAM sent out an extended stakeholder survey in 
2020. On top of the 12 themes that were specified in BAM’s 
strategic agenda 2016-2020, seven additional topics that were 
considered important in relation to market trends were selected 
and added to the survey. The only significant change made 
compared to 2019 is a broader definition of the theme ‘global 
events’ for complete cover. The materiality matrix (figure 4)

displays the prioritisation of the themes based on their relative 
importance to BAM, to its stakeholders and to society. 
The Executive Committee was involved in the engagement 
process and the discussion on the materiality of these themes. 
The discussed approach with the Executive Committee was to 
specifically report on both risk management and digitalisation, as 
these are important for BAM’s long-term value creation. 
Additionally it was discussed to emphasise the impact of global 
events in 2020, covering Covid-19 and local events such as Brexit 
and the nitrogen and PFAS issues in the Netherlands. A detailed 
description of BAM’s approach and 2020 strategic initiatives on 
risk management can be found in chapter 4. A reflection on 
digitalisation can be found in the paragraph strategy (pages 11).
An ambition of the 2020 stakeholder engagement (19 identified 
themes) was to use the output as an inspiration for the new 
strategic agenda process. In addition, the output was used for 
product-market combination discussions to define (future) market 
risks and opportunities for both BAMs business lines. 
In this year’s report, BAM does not monitor its impact on the 
seven new themes with KPIs because these are not part of its 
current strategic agenda. The prevailing 12 remain material.
Material themes
Stakeholders identified and prioritised the potential impact of 
(material) themes on themselves and on society. The prioritisation 
of BAM’s material themes remained very similar compared to last 
year. Financial performance and project and product quality and 
control remained the most important themes for BAM. 
Stakeholders identified financial performance, risk management, 
digitalisation, business conduct and tranparancy and sustainable 
procurement as most material themes. Of the new themes, risk 
management, digitalisation and global events (mainly due to 
Covid-19) appear important and have a high impact on BAM and 
its stakeholders. Climate adaptation and business disruption have 
a limited impact. Diversity and inclusion and biodiversity appear 
less important for BAM’s stakeholders. 
The most relevant theme for the client group was project and 
product quality and control. The employee group specifically 
indicated employee recruitment, development and retention as 
the most important material theme. Providers of financial capital 
indicated that BAM’s financial performance is most relevant to 
their organisations, in addition to risk management. BAM’s 
subcontractors and suppliers as well as the group representing 
society in general (NGOs, government and knowledge institutes) 
specifically indicated sustainable procurement as material 
themes. Additionally, the stakeholders were requested to 
introduce and assess matters that they felt were missing in BAM’s 
original materiality assessment. Topics raised by stakeholders 
included energy transition, building information modelling (BIM) 
and industrialised construction.

Management summary
The extraordinary circumstances caused by the Covid-19 crisis have 
had a considerable impact on our 2020 result. In addition, the 
Company’s performance was impacted by continued losses at BAM 
International, the underperformance of the German construction 
business (including a provision for a smaller asset, which is qualified 
as held for sale) and to a lesser extent by the Cologne metro 
settlement which led to a special market update in July 2020. 
As a consequence, the Executive Committee decided to start the 
process of winding down BAM International, active outside BAM’s 
European home markets, given the disappointing results and the 
ambition of the Company to focus on the Western European home 
markets. Furthermore, the Company announced a major 
restructuring programme in September in order to bring 
organizational costs in line with the lower revenue caused by 
Covid-19 and selective tendering. This programme aims to reduce 
costs of at least €100 million annually with most savings coming 
from substantial headcount reductions (1,000 FTEs). The progress 
of this programme is on schedule. 
BAM’s operational performance recovered after the disappointing 
first half year and the Group recorded a positive adjusted result 
before tax in the second half of 2020, in line with its outlook. The 
50 per cent transfer of our shares of BAM PPP to PGGM, 
subsequent deconsolidation of the assets from the balance sheet 
and revaluation of the retained 50% interest in the joint venture 
had a major impact on the full-year result. In the same period, the 
Company concluded upon a deal with Heijmans to create a joint 
venture on asphalt plants in the Netherlands and decided to

Despite the above-mentioned initiatives, net income was 
negatively impacted by non-cash impairments and restructuring 
costs. BAM believes that the new strategic plan for 2021-2023 will 
result in a smaller but more profitable and sustainable Company, 
with a predictable performance, while creating a platform for 
future growth.

As a result, the adjusted result before tax declined from 
€74.1 million (2019) to €34.3 million. This equates to an adjusted 
result before tax margin of 0.5 per cent (2019: 1 per cent), which 
is in line with the expected positive result for the second half of 
2020, as communicated by the company in July.
In the business line Construction and Property, the performance 
of the Dutch property development and residential construction 
activities remained very strong. Germany and Belgium operated 
disappointingly with losses on several projects. This was also the 
case in the United Kingdom, Belgium and Ireland, where some 
project sites were closed for several weeks resulting in 
revenue losses. 
In the business line Civil engineering, overall performance was 
impacted by severe project losses at BAM International, the 
Cologne metro settlement and the de-risking of some major 
projects due to settlements. Strong positive contributions 
included The Hague asphalt plant transactions and a the positive 
effects of German claim settlement.
The figures presented in chapter 3.1 include both continued- and 
discontinued operations. As a consequence the results of BAM PPP 
are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated 
income statement in the financial statements. See also note 37 of 
the financial statements.
Revenue
Revenue declined by 6 per cent to €6,809 million in 2020 
compared to 2019, mainly by the extraordinary circumstances 
caused by Covid-19 (resulting in 19% lower revenues in the second 
quarter compared to the same period last year) and the decision 
to wind down BAM International. Revenue recovered in the 
second half-year to €3,701 million, 1.4 per cent below the 
comparative period in the previous year.

Net income was impacted by non-cash impairments and 
restructuring costs. The restructuring charge of €44.7 million in 2020 
relates for a great part to our a major restructuring programme and 
were booked across in most operating companies. The impairments 
of €74.7 million includes for €60.8 million impairment of goodwill, 
mainly based upon the assessment as executed mid-year 2020. 
Another significant part of the impairment (€11.3 million) represents 
impairments and value adjustments on several regional land positions 
and a commercial development.
Income tax in 2020 included a non-cash impairment of deferred tax 
assets (DTA) of €50.8 million, mainly in the Dutch fiscal unity. The gain 
on the BAM PPP transaction was exempt from taxes.
Order book
The overall order book increased to a strong position of 
€13,760 million. In Civil engineering, the order book increased 
with €1.2 billion, of which €826 million in the UK and €340 million 
in Germany, offset by several other movements. Construction and 
Property remains relatively stable, except in Ireland, where a 
significant increase of €113 million is visible.
The margin on the new order intake continued to improve. Of the 
current total order book position, €6.0 billion (2019:  €5.7 billion) is 
expected to be carried out in 2021 and €9.9 billion (2019: €7.0 billion) 
in the years after. Growth is particularly noticeable in Civil engineering.
Earnings per share
The number of outstanding ordinary shares of the Group amounted 
to 273.3 million in 2020, which was in line with 2019. Earnings per 
share amounted to minus 45 euro cents (2019: 4 euro cents).
Dividend proposal
BAM’s policy is to pay out 30 to 50 per cent of the net result for 
the year, subject to considering the balance sheet structure 
supporting the strategic agenda and the interests of the 
shareholders. BAM’s net result for 2020 amounts to (€122.2) 
million. BAM proposes not to pay dividend for 2020. This is subject 
to approval by the Annual General Meeting on 14 April 2021. 
Cash and cash equivalents
In 2020, the Group generated a business cash flow of €512 million 
(2019: €141 million) driven by a positive net cash result, a strong 
trade working capital development and tax payments delays. 
Furthermore, this high cashflow is a result of a strengthened focus 
on cash during the year, optimal use of governmental support 
schemes, significant cost savings and capex reduction programme 
and exceptional results from working capital improvement efforts. 
In addition, the Company made use of the revolving credit facility 
(RCF), meaning a full draw of this facility. 
Cash from trade working capital improved significantly due to the 
improved balance between accounts payable and accounts 
receivable and the benefit of advanced payments on a few new 
contracts. On average, BAM’s payment performance to suppliers 
was in line according to contractual terms.

As at 31 December 2020 a net cash position was achieved of 
€1,154 million (2019: €583 million net cash position). This position 
comprised of cash and cash equivalents of €1,789 million minus 
borrowings of €635 million. The Group had two credit facilities as 
at 31 December 2020 which are fully drawn: unsecured 
subordinated convertible bonds for €119 million and a committed 
syndicated credit facility of €400 million. 
In 2020, the Group managed to buy back bonds with a notional 
value of €4.9 million in the open market. The outstanding bonds 
will be convertible into ordinary shares of BAM with a nominal 
value of €0.10 each. The bonds are subordinated to BAM’s senior 
payment obligations and carry an annual coupon of 3.5 per cent, 
payable semi-annually. The bonds will be redeemed at their 
principal amount on or around 13 June 2021. From 28 June 2019, 
BAM has had the option to call all but not some of the outstanding 
bonds at their principal amount plus interest, if the value of a BAM 
share exceeds for a specified period of time a price which is 
30 per cent higher than the conversion price (31/12/2020: 
€4.8334). Based on the share price as per 31 December 2020, the 
subordinated convertible bonds were out-of-the-money. If the 
bonds remain out-of-the-money, the bond holders will hold the 
bond until maturity and get repaid the face value. The committed 
syndicated credit facility will mature at 31 March 2024 and was 
fully drawn in March 2020 for the remainder of the year.

As at 31 December 2020, total borrowings amounted to 
€929 million (2019: €583 million), of which €78 million (2019: 
€101 million) concerned non-recourse debt. Non-recourse loans 
associated with PPP projects decreased significantly to 
€3 million (2019: €43 million) as a result of the transfer of 
50 per cent of our shares in BAM PPP to PGGM. Non-recourse 
debt related to property development increased with €17 million 
in 2020 (see table 11). The recourse net debt, part of the 
recourse leverage ratio in BAM’s financing arrangements, mainly 
comprising property loans of €38 million on a recourse basis 
minus cash and cash equivalents, amounted to a total 
borrowings position of €929 million as at 31 December 2020, 
including the draw of the syndicated credit facility.

Non-current assets
On balance, the non-current assets decreased in the year with 
€134 million (2019: increase with €243 million). The carrying amount 
of property, plant and equipment decreased with €24 million to 
€253 million. The majority of the capital expenditures concerned the 
asset category plant and equipment in Civil engineering.
The intangible assets predominantly contains goodwill with a 
carrying amount of €335 million, a decrease of €66 million 
compared with 2019. Goodwill is tested bi-annually and this resulted 
in an impairment of €61 million. The total carrying amount of 
intangible assets decreased with €66 million, mainly due to the 
above mentioned impairment on goodwill. In addition, the decrease 
of the GBP had an impact of minus €7 million, offset by the increase 
of goodwill of €7 million due to investment in Modern Homes 
Ireland (MHI).
The carrying amounts of joint venture investments (accounted for 
using the equity method) increased in the year with €121 million 
(from €135 million to €256 million), mainly due to the newly 
created JV BAM PPP. In addition, the same transaction caused a 
decrease to the other financial assets with €40 million (from 
€110 million to €70 million).
Net working capital
The net working capital (current assets excluding cash and cash 
equivalents minus current liabilities excluding current borrowings 
and current lease liabilities) as at 31 December 2020 amounted to 
minus €1,210 million (2019: minus €830 million). 
Gross investment in property development was reduced with 
€27 million in 2020 to €504 million (2019: €531 million), as a 
consequence of property sales, divestments and an impairment 
charge of €11.3 million. Net investment in property development, 
taking into account associated borrowings, amounted to 
€395 million (2019: €429 million).
Shareholders’ equity and capital base
Mainly due to the negative net income of €122.2 million our equity 
position deteriorated to €583 million. The following non-cash 
elements explain the other movements in shareholders’ equity of 
the Group; 
•  Dif
ference in accounting treatment of the hedges on PPP and 
transfer of 50 per cent of the shares of BAM PPP to PGGM led to a 
positive impact on equity of €95 million; 
•  The a
ctuarial results decreased, mainly due to lower discount 
rates, with a negative impact of €2 million after taxes on equity; 
•  Dep
reciation of exchange rates, mainly due to FX rates decrease, 
which was partly offset by FX gain at BAM International leading to 
a net impact on equity of minus €11 million. 
The capital base, which includes the subordinated convertible bonds, 
decreased with €47 million to €702 million (2019: 749 million). 
22Integrated Report 2020 Royal BAM Group nv

Page 23:
The book value of the convertible bond is €119 million (2019: 
€120 million). The difference with the nominal value of €120 million 
relates to the valuation of the conversion right and transaction cost.
Solvency
As at 31 December 2020, solvency was 13.4 per cent (2019: 
16.5 per cent), determined by using the capital base. The solvency 
ratio was mainly influenced by the full draw of the revolving credit 
facility, lowering the solvency by 1.2 per cent point.
Recourse solvency, the ratio in accordance with the bank 
covenants, decreased to 20.3 per cent as at 31 December 2020 
(2019: 28.5 per cent) which comfortably exceeds the required 
minimum of 15 per cent.
Other balance sheet items
Post-employment benefits
The net benefit liability amounted to €31 million as at 31 December 
2020, a change of €2 million compared to 2019. 
Provisions
Provisions, other than post-employment benefits, increased by 
€52 million to €327 million as at 31 December 2020, 
predominantly due to the net increase of the restructuring 
provision of €32 million. In addition the onerous contracts 
provision increased with €40 million.
Joint ventures 
On 23 December 2020, BAM completed the sale of a 50 per cent 
interest in BAM PPP to PGGM. As a result of this transaction, BAM has 
classified and revalued the remaining 50 per cent interest in BAM PPP 
as a joint venture, which is accounted for as an equity method 
investment. This means that as of year-end 2020, BAM PPP is no 
longer consolidated in the financial statements of the Company.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities
The Group has a deferred tax asset of €106 million (2019: 
€136 million). The decrease in the deferred tax asset was 
predominantly related due to the impairment of Dutch and 
German deferred tax assets for tax losses of €51 million and the 
non-recognition of tax losses of the German Construction and 
Property unit of €15 million. On the other hand the tax rate 
increase in the Netherlands for 2021 and following years led to 
an increase of €8 million.
Tax
In 2020, BAM recognised a tax expense of €38.5 million (2019: 
€38.7 million), heavily impacted by one-off items. Excluding the 
impairment of Dutch and German deferred tax assets of €51 
million, the non-recognition of tax losses of the German 
Construction and Property unit of €15 million, the effects of 
goodwill impairment and exempt gain on the sale of BAM PPP, the 
effective tax rate of the Group for 2020 is 12.4 per cent (2019: 
14.3 per cent), influenced predominantly by the mix of results in 
various countries.
On corporate income tax, taxes on wages, social security 
contributions and VAT, the Group paid a total amount of 
€577 million in 2020 (2019: €849 million). Cash tax paid is seriously 
impacted by government measures to allow companies to defer 
tax payments. In the Netherlands and the UK, BAM has opted to 
make use of such deferral possibility resulting in approximately 
€230 million umpaid taxes, of which €214 million in the 
Netherlands and the remainder in the UK per 31 December 2020.

Revenue in Construction and Property decreased by €468 million 
(11 per cent) to €3,758 million, driven by the impact of Covid-19 
mainly in the United Kingdom and Belgium, specifically due to the 
fact that some sites were forced to close for several weeks. 
Revenue in the Netherlands was more or less in line with 2019 and 
the same applied to Germany. BAM International was heavily 
impacted by the wind-down and disappointing progress in a few 
larger projects.
The adjusted result before tax for 2020 amount to minus 
€89 million (2019: €46.3 million), mainly due to the severe 
losses in Germany and negative results in Belgium. 
Strong contributions included the performance in The 
Netherlands especially with strong performance in property, 
residential construction and large projects. Dutch home sales 
were up by 10 per cent to €3,121 million. Impairments and value 
adjustments of property positions had an effect of €11.3 million. 
This related to several regional land positions and a commercial 
development. Including these impairments, BAM’s gross 
investment in property declined by €27 million to €504 million at 
the end of 2020. 
The disappointing performance in Germany resulted in a loss of 
€44 million. During the year there were additional costs on (older) 
projects in execution offset by an over-recovery of overhead costs. 
Furthermore, the German results were impacted by a provision for 
a smaller asset, which is qualified as held for sale. Despite the 
impact of Covid-19, revenue remained flat compared to 2019. 
The loss of €89 million in BAM International’s construction and 
property activities was disappointing. This performance is mainly 
explained by the impact of Covid-19 and additional cost overruns 
on two projects in the Middle East. In addition, under-coverage of 
company tied costs also had a negative impact.
Covid-19 had a severe impact in Belgium; revenue dropped with 
28% compared to 2019. Despite the settlement on a large claim, 
result was negative due to cost overruns and challenges on 
specific projects.  
The order book in Construction and Property remained flat at 
€6.3 billion. The order backlog in Ireland increased strongly 
(+14 per cent) due to the continuing strong demand in a variety 
of market segments, from industrial to residential. The order 
book in Germany decreased with €139 million, in line with 
strategic initiatives.

In contrast to Construction and Property, the revenue in Civil 
engineering was more or less in line with 2019, which is 
remarkable given the circumstances due to Covid-19. In fact, 
the revenue in the Netherlands even increased with €42 million. 
Despite the increase in revenue, the adjusted result before 
tax decreased significantly towards minus €89 million (2019: 
€3.6 million) due to project losses and pro-active de-risking of 
Civil engineering. This result included the losses at

BAM PPP delivered a strong performance in 2020, with an 
adjusted result before tax of €34.8 million, without the transfer of 
50 per cent of the shares to PGGM. However, this included 
€13.6 million from the partial transfer of 21 investments to PGGM 
in the first half year, reducing BAM’s interest in these projects 
from 20 per cent to 10 per cent. In addition, three projects were 
transferred to the joint venture with PGGM in the second half year 
having reached their completion dates. All the operational 
projects have remained available throughout Covid-19 to date.
In 2020, one new project was added to the portfolio with the 
financial close of the Dendermonde prison in Belgium. On 
31 December 2020 BAM PPP handed back the A59 in the 
Netherlands to the client at concession completion. At the end 
of 2020, BAM had 41 operational projects, of which 36 with an 
equity stake, and 7 under construction. The PPP portfolio also 
provides recurring operations and maintenance revenues for 
other BAM companies.
BAM PPP and PGGM 
On 23 December 2020, BAM completed the transfer of 50 per cent 
of the shares of BAM PPP to PGGM. As a result of this transaction, 
BAM has classified the remaining 50 per cent interest in BAM PPP 
as a joint venture, which is accounted for as an equity method 
investment. This means that as of year-end 2020, BAM PPP is no 
longer consolidated in the financial statements of our Company.
The gain on this transaction, before the reclassification of reserves 
on cash flow hedging and exchange rate differences, amounts to 
€155 million. Fifty per cent of this gain accounts for a ‘fair value 
step up’ on the remaining interest in the former subsidiary from its 
carrying amount to fair value. This step up shall systematically be 
allocated as costs to the future Group’s share of the profit and 
losses of the entity. The reserves involved are reclassified to the 
profit or loss for the amount €32 million (negative) and €5 million 
(negative) respectively and are attributed to the transaction 
resulting in a total gain of this transaction of €118 million. There is 
no income tax on this gain.
BAM expects that the enhanced strategic partnership with PGGM 
will generate significant potential to accelerate growth in existing 
European and new global markets.
BAM International, including the settlement on one major 
project. In addition, the Cologne metro settlement also 
impacted the result. 
In line with Construction and Property, the Netherlands had a 
positive contribution to the result with €22 million. This result 
benefitted from the deal with Heijmans to create a joint venture 
on asphalt plants in the Netherlands and the decision to 
discontinue production at the asphalt plant in The Hague. 
Furthermore, the settlement of a major project in Germany 
contributed to the result. This was offset by the development of 
long-term maintenance contracts and one specific project.
The result in Germany was mainly impacted by the Cologne metro 
settlement and a project in the tunnelling division. The settlement 
of a major project that benefited the Netherlands also had a 
positive impact on Germany. The performance of the Belgium 
activities in Civil engineering were also disappointing from a 
financial result point of view. During 2020, the result on several 
larger and mid-sized projects deteriorated, which was partly offset 
by an over-recovery of overheads. 
In the United Kingdom, BAM Nuttall delivered a positive result. 
The underlying performance of the activities remained strong, 
however the result in the second half-year was impacted by two 
provisions, which led to a positive result of €12 million. 
The order book in Civil engineering increased to €7.6 billion. 
The overall strong order intake in the UK led to an increase of 
22 per cent and a total order backlog in the UK of almost 
€4 billion, driven by increasing government investment in 
infrastructure. The order book in Germany also improved during 
the year, mainly due to the award of a major tunnelling project. 
The order backlog of BAM International declined by €270 million 
as a consequence of the announced winddown. The order 
backlog in the Netherlands remained stable.

Management summary
BAM aims to prevent all accidents. However, the target for 
incident frequency (IF) of BAM employees at risk on projects was 
not achieved in 2020. BAM regrets one fatality in 2020 on its 
projects.
The Company is working hard to foster a genuine and strong 
safety leadership culture within senior management. ‘Your Safety 
is My Safety’, BAM’s ongoing safety campaign, aims at zero 
accidents. This can only be achieved through a joint approach and 
responsibility at all sites, at home, while travelling to work and in 
the offices. Despite a strong reduction in the number of hours 
worked in 2020, smaller (lost time) accidents have not decreased
proportionally, resulting in a higher incident frequency. 
One of the areas of attention is to learn from accidents and 
near-miss situations that have occurred and to take corrective 
actions to prevent repetition. Learning from best practices and 
positive developments also helps people to react to similar 
situations in future. Accident investigations are a crucial learning 
tool. Workplaces with positive pro-safety attitudes carry out 
similar investigations into near-miss cases as they do for actual 
accidents. Furthermore, BAM aims to increase the focus on mental 
health-related matters in future.
BAM also targets social performance in other parts of the 
business, highlighted by its leadership programmes, the updated 
Code of Conduct and improved reporting on activities aimed at 
enhancing lives. BAM can improve its monitoring of human rights 
(via social audits) and other social aspects in its supply chain.
Social value for BAM 
BAM’s activities have an impact on local communities, occupants 
and other users of buildings and infrastructure and society as a 
whole. BAM aims to create sustainable environments that 
enhance people’s lives. This chapter describes how all social 
subjects are interrelated and how BAM actively collaborates with 
all stakeholders to create long-term (social) value. Health and 
safety is the most important element of the Company’s social 
performance: every employee should be able to return home safe 
every day. This requires excellent performance from all 
employees and supply chain partners on the construction sites 
every day. The construction supply chain is increasingly complex 
and fragmented and needs active collaboration to manage 
responsible supply chain management, human rights and ethical 
business conduct.
The Group increases intellectual capital and human capital by 
investing in its employees and in the development of the supply 
chain. BAM recognises the importance of Group-wide 
development and implementation of its talent strategy, based on 
BAM’s organisational development and strategic objectives. The 
positive legacy to society is also reflected in the programme for 
enhancing lives.
Health and safety
Creating the right environment for knowledge-sharing and 
scalable learning throughout BAM’s supply chain is most 
important to reach the Group’s safety targets. 
Ambition: to offer added value to clients, employees, business partners and the community

3.2 Social performance
26Integrated Report 2020 Royal BAM Group nv

Page 27:
This is done by: 
Developing leadership and behaviour by carrying out safety behaviour 
audits (SBAs) 
Due to Covid-19, no SBAs took place in 2020.
An SBA consists of the following steps:
• Ass
essment (audit);
• Interview, assessment of records and compliance analysis on site;
• Close-out and final score;
• Re
port;
• Imp
rovement plan with actions and areas that require special 
attention;
• Ben
chmarking and sharing outcome.
Rewarding excellence
Safety behaviour audits (SBAs) will make excellence count and 
reward (safety) innovations. By disclosing the results through the 
safety portal, safety excellence becomes visible to other operating 
companies with an emphasis on continuous improvement within 
organisations and throughout the Group. 
SBA scores focus on three areas: safe environment, management 
system and site conditions. Excellent performance in leading and 
lagging indicators (IF) in operating companies will result in less 
control by Royal BAM Group’s SBAs, but should increase commitment 
to share excellence performance by organising a safety exchange. 
Recognition of performance by carrying out safety exchanges (SEs) 
In 2020, one SE took place as scheduled. The other SEs were 
cancelled due to Covid-19. SEs or safety reviews are peer reviews 
and focus on creating a debate aimed at challenging and learning 
(themes from the maturity model). This dialogue between two 
operating companies who have to develop best practices together 
will result in a customised knowledge exchange. 
Strengthening BAM’s (safety) culture supported by uniform safety 
communication processes, methods and channels 
In 2018, BAM launched the safety campaign ‘Your Safety is My 
Safety’. This campaign was continued in 2019, when the Company 
made safety more personal by conducting safety conversations. In 
2019, BAM launched the new Code of Conduct, ‘Doing things 
right’. These worldwide BAM campaigns are about the way BAM 
acts and behaves. It is important to have a dialogue about this 
together. On 1 September 2020, BAM launched the ‘Speak Up’ 
campaign, including the ‘Speak Up’ video, in which colleagues 
play a leading role. ‘Speak Up’ is the basis for many other themes 
in the field of safety, the Code of Conduct, and mental health and 
wellbeing. In this next step in the ‘Your Safety is My Safety’ 
campaign the Company focuses on psychological safety. BAM 
employees talk about their experiences in relation to safety, the 
Code of Conduct, and mental health and wellbeing. By this 
approach BAM wants to invite more employees to do the same 
and speak up. Not only speaking up is important. An important 
basis for a speak up-culture is listening up. 
Summer campaign
In the summer of 2020, a Company-wide campaign was held to 
remind everyone why it’s important to drink enough water, 
protect yourself with sun cream, to not work in direct sunlight for 
too long, take enough rest during the day and wear the right 
protective clothing. In addition, employees were asked to 
encourage each other to do the same and to talk to each other 
about the consequences of working in summer conditions. To 
illustrate just how important being safe in the sun is, a story was 
shared of a colleague at BAM Infra Nederland who has been 
working at BAM since 1979. He was diagnosed with skin cancer in 
2017. In a personal and touching way, he explained how he 
experienced what working in the direct sun can do to someone.
Worldwide BAM Safety Day  
On 6 October 2020, Worldwide BAM Safety Day was organised for 
the eleventh time. The aim of this yearly event is to reflect 
together on the importance of a safe working environment to 
improve employees’ awareness. This year’s Safety Day focused on 
speaking up and listening up.  It was the first time mental health 
and psychological safety were addressed. BAM is committed to 
supporting, promoting and maintaining the overall wellbeing of 
its employees through awareness-raising, training, webinars, and 
workplace practices, and encouraging individuals to take 
ownership of their own mental health and wellbeing, particularly 
with the challenges of Covid-19 in 2020. For Worldwide BAM 
Safety Day 2020, a new content platform was launched to raise 
awareness on speaking up. During the day all BAM employees 
were invited to organise a safety conversation about ‘Speak Up’ by 
using the new set of 20 safety conversation starters. 
Conversations could be held in-office, remotely or virtually via 
Microsoft Teams. In addition, an online webinar with senior 
management was organised to discuss the importance of 
speaking up and listening up and how senior management plays 
an important role in leading by example.   
Incident frequency in 2020
BAM’s incident frequency (IF) is determined by the total number 
of industrial accidents leading to absence from work per million 
hours worked on construction sites (all BAM site employees on 
own work and joint ventures on risk). In 2020, IF increased to
5.3 (2019: 4.8), which was above the 2020 target of 3.5.  
In challenging times in the economy, people tend to increase their 
risk appetite, due to job uncertainty or  loyalty towards team 
members and supervisors. Other contributing factors may include 
less adequate work preparation and misjudgement of risks during 
the Covid-19 period with less adequate supervision on project 
sites. However, this is hard to measure.

Serious accidents
BAM is highly committed to prevent all incidents and feels 
responsible for all people who are involved in or are influenced by 
the activities of the Group. This includes employees, clients, 
partners, suppliers, subcontractors and members of the public. 
BAM regrettably had to report one fatal occupational accident on a 
BAM site in 2020. This was extensively evaluated with the Executive 
Committee and the Supervisory Board. Furthermore, the number 
of serious accidents (BAM employees, hired, subcontractors’ 
employees, or other) in 2020 was 112 (2019: 143). The fatal

BAM Plant UK has created a skincare stand following a request 
from the team at the BAM Ritchies, Lower Thames Crossing site 
for a suncream dispensing stand. The site already makes full use of 
BAM Plants fire and first aid stands and now has an SPF skincare 
stand to add to the collection. 
BAM Infra Verkeerstechniek wants to prevent accidents 
proactively and has therefore invested in the Flister application. 
By inputting a warning message in the navigation systems or 
navigation applications of approaching road users, the company 
increases the safety of its road workers.
Mid-January 2020, BAM Belgium organised its BAM Belgium Safety 
Weeks. In those two weeks, all operational colleagues participated 
in six workshops. Fourteen different topics were covered during 
the Safety Weeks. All topics fell under the following three pillars: 
organisational safety, technical safety and cultural safety.
The Group-wide safety portal was updated to facilitate 
knowledge-sharing between the operating companies with regard 
to Covid-19. The operating companies have been sharing good 
practices such as briefings, risk assessments, business continuity 
management plans and national guidelines.

Setting minimum health management requirements
More insidious than the fatal and serious occupational accidents is 
the number of employees with a health damage or a long-term 
illness that were caused or worsened by work. Many of these 
diseases manifest themselves only years after exposure and some 
are ultimately deadly. BAM believes that all injuries, deaths and 
illnesses should be prevented. BAM is in the process of setting 
minimum health management requirements. Within ENCORD 
(Europe’s forum for industry-led research, development and 
innovation in the construction industry) the Group has put 
research and development in the field of quartz dust and asbestos 
inhalation, diabetes and skin cancer on the agenda.

Covid-19-related fluctuation in reported hours and BAM 
anticipates strong improvement in 2021 as the Company 
continues to embed operational safety standards in each 
geography. It remains BAM’s overall aspiration to progressively 
achieve and improve on an IF of 3.5 in the short to medium term.
Organisational development and employee 
engagement 
 
From a human resources perspective, ‘Building the present, 
creating the future’ required harmonised and modern ways of 
working, standardised and automated processes across all 
operating companies, leveraging self-service and a platform that 
provides (predictive) people analytics and reporting and also 
supports employees in development programmes. BAM wants to 
create a safe and engaging working environment and a talented 
workforce and aims to become the employer of choice in its key 
markets so that BAM can enhance the life of employees and 
everyone around BAM. 
Covid-19 provided challenges for BAM in connection with human 
resources, mainly due to lockdown measures that led to the 
temporary closure of construction sites. As a result of these 
measures, BAM Nuttal and BAM Construct UK sent workers on 
temporary leave or ‘furloughed’ status, BAM Contractors Ltd 
(Ireland) has made use of the possibility of temporarily suspending 
the employment contract and BAM in Belgium made use of 
temporary unemployment based on governmental support. 
Furthermore, office-based employees have been working from 
home as much as possible across the Group.
The new senior leadership team took shape in 2020 with the
appointments of a new Group CEO and COO for the business line
Civil engineering. In addition, numerous changes have been made
in the leadership teams of operating companies such as BAM
Nuttall, BAM Deutschland, BAM Infra Nederland and BAM Interbuild.
BAM People
BAM People is the human resources self-service portal, which is 
now live in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Ireland and Belgium. 
In 2020, despite Covid-19 and often in remote sessions, the 
programme of implementing BAM People was continued and 
delivered according to the adjusted timelines. BAM People 
contributes to the achievement of BAM’s strategy through uniform 
processes, digital collaboration and unambiguous reports.
Learning
Via BAM Learning, employees have access to all trainings available. 
They can select a training based on personal needs, and after 
approval from their manager attend the training. Implementation 
of BAM Learning continued for the United Kingdom, Ireland, 
Belgium and Germany during 2020. An e-learning programme for 
the Code of Conduct is mandatory for selected employees. Since

the launch in November 2019 more than 13,000 employees 
completed the Code of Conduct e-learning, which is around 
91 per cent of the selected employees. The target for 2021 is 
to reach a minimum of 95 per cent completeness.
Employee engagement
BAM attaches great value to the engagement of its employees. 
Via a digital and rotating panel approach a standardised set of 
questions is sent out periodically. Outcomes are available in real 
time in an online dashboard. With smart analytics and algorithms, 
BAM aims to predict the future development of its employees and 
use these insights to improve the most important people-related 
KPIs. During Covid-19, BAM pro-actively added additional 
questions to monitor the safety and wellbeing of employees. 
Labour relations - European Works Council
The European Works Council (EWC) has shown itself to be a 
constructive partner on several topics in 2020. Several meetings 
took place, for example on the cost reduction programme. The 
EWC’s input on a wide range of topics such as global mobility and 
the development of performance management within BAM has 
been very valuable.
Recruitment
BAM strives to diversify its workforce and find potential talent 
with different capabilities, various degrees of experience and 
different genders, ages, nationalities and cultural backgrounds. 
Together, they will help BAM mirror its client base and execute its 
strategic agenda. By adopting a data-driven approach and the use 
of smart recruitment technology BAM will be able to understand 
its key strategic target groups, maintain its position as an 
employer of choice and improve its recruitment practices.
Diversity and inclusion
BAM recognises and values the benefits that diversity brings in 
terms of ensuring BAM has a sustainable business and can reflect 
the communities in which the Company works. An inclusive 
culture ensures that BAM can make better decisions to deliver the 
best innovation and insights to our customers, by attracting the 
best talent with diverse perspectives. 
BAM’s inclusive approach means that all stakeholders are treated 
with fairness, dignity and respect. The Company aims to avoid 
being adversely influenced or prejudiced in any way by an 
individual’s age, gender identity, marital or civil partnership 
status, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability (physical or 
mental), religion or belief, working patterns, caring 
responsibilities, pregnancy or trade union membership.
BAM mainly focuses on gender diversification, as this is the most 
challenging aspect of diversity in the construction sector. In 2020, 
BAM increased its efforts to attract women into its business and 
enable them to progress into senior roles, with KPIs in place to 
measure and review the progress and approach.
Mental health
BAM is committed to supporting, promoting and maintaining 
the overall wellbeing of its employees through awareness 
raising, training, guidance, and workplace practices, 
encouraging individuals to take ownership of their own mental 
health and wellbeing and that of others, particularly in the face 
of the challenges of Covid-19. Mental health support for 
employees is provided at varying levels across operating 
companies and includes: company doctors, employee assistance 
programmes, telephone numbers, one-to-one and on-line 
counselling, mental health first aiders and wellbeing champions, 
line managers and Human Resources. 2020’s Worldwide BAM 
Safety Day addressed wellbeing and psychological safety 
specifically. Levels of engagement and success are measured 
through surveys and absence rates. Some operating companies 
additionally offer flexible working to support the work/life 
balance, wellbeing days and a volunteering day and promote 
wellbeing within their supply chain. 
Leadership programmes
In 2020 BAM continued with several leadership programmes that 
were developed in the last three years: Olympus Leadership 
Programme (for senior project managers), Enterprise Leaders 
Programme (for directors and managers) and Future Leaders 
Programme (for young professionals identified as talent with 
management potential).
So far, a total of 161 senior project managers have attended the 
Olympus programme. In all leadership programmes, blended 
personal coaching is an integrated part of the journey and 
beyond.
Due to Covid-19 BAM decided in March 2020 to postpone all 
leadership programmes (face-to-face delivery). This action has 
been taken in line with general measures to control the spread of 
the virus, and to safeguard the health of BAM employees. From 
September 2020, the leadership development journeys of 
programmes that were already started in the beginning of the 
year were completed virtually. All leadership programmes will be 
available with a virtual delivery option in future. 
For senior management within BAM, the Accelerated Leadership 
programme will kick off in the first half of 2021. One of the 
foundation elements of the programme is the Leadership 
Compass, a set of attitudes and behaviours to establish common 
leadership and culture, aligned with BAM values. The programme 
is developed to accelerate purpose-driven and collective leadership 
and enable our most senior leaders to lead the business aligned to 
BAM’s strategy as well as to develop a mindset that stimulates 
personal growth and continuous improvement.

Annual total compensation by country
In 2020, the annual total compensation ratios decreased in most 
countries of operation. This indicates that the gap between the 
highest paid individual and the average annual total compensation 
for all employees increased. The relatively high ratio for BAM’s 
international business can be explained due to the fact that the 
salary ratio of BAM International is subject to locations / areas 
BAM International works (high vs low salary countries) and the 
total of employees working in those countries. The exchange rate 
also influences the salary ratio. And due to the wind down of BAM 
International, many employees have left the company. Overall, 
the contracts of employees with relatively low salaries were 
terminated / not extended, which also affects the salary ratio.

Business conduct and transparency  
BAM is committed to being an ethical company and to live up to 
the highest standards of honesty and integrity in the way it does 
business with clients, suppliers and within BAM. BAM’s Code of 
Conduct and underlying policies further define how to do the 
right thing and remain true to the BAM core values. Living the 
Code of Conduct contributes to a safe, ethical and sustainable 
culture and protects the future of BAM. New employees must sign 
a statement in which they acknowledge to comply with this code 
as part of their employment contract with BAM.

BAM believes that communication and training are fundamental 
to make and keep the objective and content of the Code of 
Conduct alive in the organisation. Therefore, an e-learning tool is 
used to train selected employees on the code. The training, 
available in English, German, French and Dutch, is mandatory for 
(new) white-collar BAM employees. Progress is closely monitored 
and reported to management. The aim to achieve 95% 
completeness of the e-learning by the selected employees has not 
been reached yet in 2020 (see page 29 - Learning), but remains the 
focus in 2021. BAM’s blue-collar employees are trained through 
so-called toolbox meetings. BAM strongly believes in a targeted 
approach for the different working groups to achieve optimum 
understanding and adaptation.
Furthermore, BAM has a robust speak-up process, including an 
independent speak-up line to report suspicions of misconduct. 
Employees are encouraged to discuss dilemmas. Together with 
safety and wellbeing functions, an updated ‘Speak Up’ campaign 
was launched in 2020, which reached out to almost 
15,000 colleagues. This campaign is kept active with a speak-up 
platform, communication of stories and possibility to discuss 
dilemmas based on conversation starter cards.
In 2020, several cases were reported within the various operating 
companies. This was in line with previous years. The reported 
suspicions of misconduct have been assessed and where needed 
sanctions have been taken, up to and including dismissal. 
Reported cases dealt with issues such as inappropriate use of 
company assets, equal treatment and privacy breaches (of which a 
limited number needed to be reported to the external local 
privacy authorities).
BAM’s Ethics and Compliance Committee supports the Executive 
Committee and the operating companies with the compliance 
programme, actual compliance matters and remedial actions, and 
to ensure consistency across the Group. Reported suspicions of 
misconduct are discussed on a quarterly base with the Executive 
Committee and every six months with the Audit Committee of the 
Supervisory Board. Furthermore, on a yearly basis the 
effectiveness of the management approach is assessed and 
improvement activities are captured in the operating plan of the 
governance, risk and compliance (GRC) function.
Corruption Perception Index
The Corruption Perception Index (CPI) is calculated by 
Transparency International, which focuses on the strict application 
of the UN Convention against Corruption. The CPI classifies 
countries according to their perceived level of corruption on a 
scale from 0 to 100. BAM mainly operates in Europe, which 
explains the overall score. BAM obtains its main turnover in 
countries with a low or very low risk of corruption.

Human rights 
BAM’s policy to protect human rights is integrated in the Code of 
Conduct. In addition, the Company underwrites the importance 
of the standards of the International Finance Corporation, in 
particularly with regard to labour and working conditions and 
the promotion of sound worker-management relations. BAM 
believes that fair treatment of workers (which includes providing 
them with an extensive safety programme on site, avoiding 
discrimination in employment, not using child labour, paying fair 
wages, offering education and training opportunities and 
creating healthy, decent working conditions) will result in 
tangible benefits for all, such as enhancement of efficiency and 
productivity of our business.
A possible risk of violation of BAM’s human rights principles lies in 
the chain of subcontractors and suppliers. To limit that risk, 
suppliers and subcontractors are bound by BAM’s general 
purchasing conditions. More details on human right risks are are 
included in the description of the material theme ‘human rights’ 
in chapter 9.7 (see page 216).
For practical reasons related to Covid-19 and partly due to the 
decision-making in connection with the decision to wind down 
BAM International, it has not been possible to carry out a social 
audit in 2020. Moreover, in 2020 there was no substantive 
response from BWI (Building and Wood Worker’s International) to 
the text proposed by BAM for a new framework agreement. Of 
course the 2006 framework agreement with BWI remains fully 
32Integrated Report 2020 Royal BAM Group nv

applicable. BAM still has the ambition to reach a new framework 
agreement with BWI.  
Combatting slavery
BAM is committed to prevent slavery and human trafficking 
throughout its operations and those associated with its business. 
Modern slavery is also an issue for BAM and its supply chains. BAM is a 
partner member of the Supply Chain Sustainability School 
(www.supplychainschool.co.uk), where help and advice are freely 
available to assist suppliers within the construction industry. 
Combating slavery is not a standalone issue, but one that is part of 
BAM’s approach to ensure that people are treated with dignity and 
respect, that goods and services are purchased responsibly, that 
transparency is promoted and that business is done with the highest 
professional and ethical standards. With its speak-up procedure, BAM 
has an adequate whistleblower process in place, which encourages 
employees to report on any suspicions of misconduct.
Supply chain management
The Company is involved in many stages of the construction
 value chain, from development, engineering and construction to 
maintenance and operation. Suppliers are essential to BAM. Their 
knowledge, people and other resources provide more than 
70 per cent of the turnover BAM brings as value to its clients. 
Large supply categories include concrete works, steel construction, 
mechanical and electrical engineering and façades. Most of these 
are typically sourced from preferred suppliers close to the sites. 
BAM aims to increase social and environmental awareness and 
continiously looks for opportunities to jointly improve sustainability 
performance of both BAM and its suppliers. 
Suppliers and subcontractors are subject to BAM’s general 
purchasing terms and conditions, which covers commitments on 
safety, human rights and the environment. 
The Group’s Procurement department continues to further 
develop its spend-and-contract tool, called ‘Bravo’. The number of 
yearly supplier and subcontractor performance reviews continues 
to increase: In 2020, 2475 performance reviews were carried out 
(2019: 1391). The system also provides digital construction 
assessments of the supply chain, which again contributed to 
successful third party (re-)certification. Additional functionalities 
to improve the quality of vendor information have been 
considered, tested and prepared.
In 2020, a procurement data warehouse was implemented, 
bringing together multiple data sources from which better 
dashboards and reports can be obtained with detailed information 
regarding the supply chain to the various stakeholders. 
Procurement involvement of operating companies during the 
tender phase is still increasing. A new uniform reporting structure 
to determine and communicate strategies, risks and opportunities 
was implemented together with Procurement taking part in the 
multi-disciplinary reviews of major tenders.
An example of supply chain engagement is the ongoing 
engagement with car leasing companies across the Group. BAM’s 
vehicle fleet accounts for circa 30 per cent of BAM’s direct CO2 
emissions. In line with BAM’s science-based target, the company 
has the ambition to further increase the share of electric vehicles 
in the vehicle fleet. As a result of this engagement, the amount of 
electric vehicles within BAM increased from 143 (december 2019) 
to 269 (december 2020).

Enhancing lives
Playing a part in addressing social issues in its home countries is 
part of BAM’s sustainability strategy. The ‘Enhancing lives’ 
programme was launched in 2016 with the aim to structure 
efforts on community engagement. The programme aims to 
monitor the value added to the lives of people with whom the 
Company comes into contact through its activities and 
connections with local communities. BAM’s enhancing lives 
activities are mainly focused on employment opportunities, 
training, education, community involvement and charity. BAM has 
set a target of enhancing one million lives by 2020. 
Progress to date
Over the past five years, BAM has developed an approach to 
monitor and report the number of lives enhanced. This approach 
included defining and categorising activities that contribute to life 
enhancement, for the sake of consistent reporting. But even with 
defined categories and reporting guidelines in place, safeguarding 
the consistency and quality of reported enhancing lives figures 
remains challenging. The reported number of lives enhanced (see 
table 25) is therefore not included in the scope of the external 
assurance engagement. 
In total, BAM has reported 510,000 enhanced lives in the past 
three years. During this period, BAM recognised what enhancing 
lives means and that quality is more important than quantity. For 
example, activities that were considered to have too little impact 
to be qualified as life-enhancing activities (such as social media), 
were discarded. The decision to focus on quality over quantity and 
a delay in setting up the enhancing lives reporting processes have 
been the main reasons why BAM was not able to meet the target 
of one million enhanced lives.
Although BAM was not able to successfully complete the 
programme in terms of validation of the reported figures and 
reaching the one million lives, developing and trying to improve the 
programme has been an educational experience. It has helped BAM 
to better understand how it can enhance the lives of people in a 
meaningful way and has provided useful insights how BAM can 
measure social value going forward.
Community engagement progress 
In 2020, local community engagement programmes regarding the 
impact of building projects on the local environment were 
implemented in 28 per cent of BAM’s projects. These were initiatives 
as part of existing programmes, such as the Considerate Constructors 
Scheme (CCS) in the United Kingdom and its Dutch equivalent 
Bewuste Bouwers, as well as unique initiatives of engagement 
managers on projects and site-specific sponsoring or charity work.
In the United Kingdom, 11 CCS projects were registered in 2020 
and nine awards were won: one gold, six silver and two bronze.
Based on the success of the United Kingdom’s Considerate 
Constructors Scheme, BAM was one of the companies that 
introduced the scheme Bewuste Bouwers in the Netherlands in 
2009. In 2020, 58 sites were registered under the scheme in the 
Netherlands (2019: 60). The average audit score in 2020 was 8.1, 
well above the industry benchmark of 7.4.

Management summary
BAM has delivered on its climate positive 2020 targets, as the CO 2 
intensity was well below the target and BAM was again included in 
the prestigious CDP A List. Covid-19 impacts such as working from 
home and temporary closures of construction sites have 
significantly contributed to the large reduction in CO2, but BAM 
has estimated that even without Covid-19 impacts the 2020 target 
for CO2 reduction would have been achieved.
The amount of construction waste also decreased substantially in 
2020, mostly due to a shift in project phases. The reduction is also 
partly caused by the wind-down of BAM International and 
temporaryl closures of construction sites due to Covid-19. The 
recycle or re-use rate slightly increased to 76 per cent. Improving 
waste management and further pursuing reduction measures will 
be required to bring the Company closer to its goal of zero 
construction and office waste to landfill and incineration by 2025. 
BAM did not meet the target of developing zero carbon products 
and services in all operating companies. So far, these products 
and services have only been developed in the Construction and 
Property sector in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. BAM 
delivered circular projects in the Netherlands, Belgium and the 
United Kingdom. BAM expects the market demand for zero 
carbon and circular products to grow across the business, and 
aims to continue to develop and scale up successful solutions.
Although BAM did manage to increase the coverage and sustainable 
timber use in the past years, BAM did not meet its target of 100 per 
cent as parts of BAM’s operations in Germany and Ireland have not 
yet been included. BAM aims to continue to put effort in working 
towards sourcing of 100 per cent sustainable timber.
Sustainability strategy
BAM’s ambition is to have a net positive impact on climate and 
resources in 2050. The Company aims to reduce its impact on the 
environment and people, by collaborating with the supply chain, 
encouraging innovative and digital thinking through its products, 
and realising benefits of circular business models. This chapter 
describes the Company’s performance towards creating a 
sustainable built environment from an environmental perspective. 
The sustainability strategy emphasises both climate change (see 
‘Climate positive’) and resource constraints (see ‘Resource positive’). 
BAM is preparing for a low-carbon economy and intends to reduce 
its own emissions as well as supply chain emissions. BAM can have 
a large impact on the lifecycle carbon footprint of buildings and 
infrastructure, for example through material selection, design 
and/or asset management. The Company is working towards a 
circular economy and believes the industry could leave a positive 
legacy to the environment if it is able to work from reversible

CO2 footprint
The CO2 intensity decreased to 20.0 tonnes per € million revenue, 
a 15 per cent reduction compared to 2019. With a 35 per cent 
reduction compared to 2015, BAM has exceeded its 2020 target of 
25 per cent reduction. Covid-19 impacts have significantly 
contributed to the achieved reduction in 2020. However, BAM 
analysed a scenario without Covid-19 impacts and concluded that 
the 2020 target would also have been met in this scenario: the CO2 
designs that are regenerative. BAM aims to reduce construction 
waste by becoming more efficient, utilising off-site manufacturing 
and by working with its supply chain to eliminate waste throughout 
the lifecycle of its projects. 
 
Impact of Covid-19
Covid-19 has also impacted BAM’s sustainability performance. 
Most measures to contain Covid-19 directly led to a reduction of the 
Company’s environmental footprint. The temporary closure of 
construction sites in countries which implemented a lockdown 
(Belgium, Ireland and partially the United Kingdom), led to a 
reduction in activity but also to less energy consumption and waste 
production on these sites. Travel restrictions and working-from-home 
policies have reduced CO2 emissions. These reductions might be 
more structural as the increase in people working from home and the 
number of digital meetings is expected to (partly) remain after 
Covid-19.
In total, Covid-19 has been responsible for circa 60 per cent of BAM’s 
CO2 footprint reduction in 2020. Temporary closures of some 
construction sites have slightly lowered the amount of waste coming 
from these sites, but overall the effects of Covid-19 affected the total 
amount of construction and office waste only to a limited extent.
Climate positive
BAM focuses on reducing its own carbon emissions and helping 
others to reduce emissions more widely. Its carbon footprint is 
monitored by measuring carbon emissions using the greenhouse 
gas (GHG) protocol. The GHG protocol defines three scopes for 
greenhouse gas accounting and reporting purposes:
•  Gre
enhouse gas directly emitted from the Company’s own 
activities (scope 1);
•  Ind
irect emissions from purchased electricity, heating and 
cooling (scope 2) ;
•  Indirect emissions up and downstream in the value chain (scope 3).
BAM reports all material emissions (scopes 1 and 2) and employee 
transport emissions (scope 3).
CO2 reduction targets
To reduce its direct impact on climate change, BAM has set a target 
to reduce CO2 emissions intensity by 25 per cent by 2020 compared 
to 2015 levels (scope 1, 2 and travel-related scope 3). 
A longer-term science-based target is also in place to ensure that 
the CO2 reduction ambition is in line with climate change science. 
This science-based target has been set for 2030 and provides a 
pathway towards BAM’s long-term climate positive ambition. By 
2030, BAM aims to: 
• Red
uce scope 1 and scope 2 CO 2 intensity by 50 per cent 
compared to 2015;
• Red
uce scope 3 CO2 emissions by 20 per cent compared to 2017 
(the first year BAM assessed its entire scope 3 emissions).

intensity would have been approximately 2 tonnes per € million 
higher (22.0 tonnes per € million) without Covid-19 impacts. In 
total, absolute CO2 emissions decreased by 20 per cent to 
136 kilotonnes (2019: 170 kilotonnes). 
Ongoing CO2 reduction activities, an increased share of green 
electricity use (63 per cent in 2020 versus 53 per cent in 2019), 
Covid-19 impacts and a less energy-intensive project in the civil 
business line were the main reasons for the CO2 footprint 
reduction.  BAM’s energy intensity was 0.30 TJ per million revenue 
(2019: 0.34). The absolute energy consumption decreased to 
2,047 TJ (2019: 2,442). 
Emissions from construction sites
The largest source of carbon emissions lies in BAM’s construction 
sites, this is sub-divided into ‘Construction and Property’ and ‘Civil 
engineering’, of which the latter is by far the most energy and 
carbon intensive. In 2020, absolute emissions from construction 
sites decreased by 20 per cent compared to 2019 due to carrying 
out less energy-intensive civil engineering projects in the United 
Kingdom and the Netherlands, the wind-down of BAM 
International, Covid-19 impacts and ongoing CO2 reduction 
efforts. Key aspects of BAM’s CO 2 reduction strategy are to lower 
the reliance on diesel and gasoil and to procure renewable 
electricity. 
Emissions from vehicle fleet
The emissions from the vehicle fleet, which account for 31 per 
cent of BAM’s total CO2 emissions, decreased by 22 per cent 
compared to 2019. This decrease can mainly be attributed to 
working from home and employee travel reductions as a result of 
Covid-19. BAM also continued to pursue a more efficient and 
sustainable vehicle fleet, by optimising travel distances of 
employees and deploying more energy-efficient vehicles. BAM has 
almost doubled the amount of fully electric vehicles in its lease 
fleet: from 143 in 2019 to 269 in 2020 (a share of five per cent of 
the total lease fleet).

Emissions from asphalt plants
The emissions from asphalt production account for 17 per cent of 
BAM’s total CO2 emissions. In 2020, CO2 emissions were 
six per cent lower than in 2019. Even though more asphalt was 
produced in 2020, ongoing efforts to improve energy efficiency 
and the use of less carbon-intensive fuels led to a reduction of CO2 
emissions in asphalt plants.
Emissions from offices and air travel
Working from home policies due to Covid-19 led to a CO 2 
emission reduction in offices of circa 10 per cent compared to 
2019. The largest impact of Covid-19 on BAM’s CO 2 footprint was 
on air travel: CO2 emissions from air travel were 57 per cent lower 
than in 2019.
Green revenue
BAM supports clients in the reduction of footprint and 
environmental impact. In 2020, 19 per cent of BAM’s revenue, 
approximately €1.3 billion (€1.5 billion in 2019), came from 
projects that were registered with third-party green building or 
sustainable construction rating organisations, such as the US 
Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental 
Design (LEED) standards, the United Kingdom’s Building Research 
Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM), 
Germany’s Passivhaus standards and other objective and 
third-party standards or BAM’s green building products.
BAM’s climate action acknowledged
BAM was again acknowledged for its climate initiatives in 2020, as 
it achieved a place on CDP’s prestigious ‘A List’ for climate change. 
This global ranking evaluates corporate efforts to address and 
mitigate climate change. The index is produced by CDP (Carbon 
Disclosure Project), a not-for-profit charity that runs the global 
disclosure system for investors, companies, cities, states and 
regions to manage their environmental impacts at the request of 
515 investors. Information provided by almost 10,000 companies 
was independently assessed on the basis of the CDP scoring 
methodology and ranked accordingly. BAM was recognised for its 
actions to reduce carbon emissions and assess the potential role of 
climate change on the business strategy and performance.

Within the taskforce PAS/PFAS that BAM started within its Dutch 
Civil engineering business line, analyses at project level are made
to assess the potential impact of nitrogen on the projects BAM 
undertakes. Measures to reduce nitrogen and carbon emissions, 
such as electrification of equipment, are implemented at 
individual level both in the design and construction phase. 
Resource positive
BAM strives to achieve a net positive impact on resources by 2050,
eliminating waste over the lifecycle of developments by the way it
designs and builds projects. 
BAM aims to preserve raw materials and resources over the 
lifecycle of its built environment and deliver projects using safe, 
healthy and natural materials. BAM intends to: 
• Elimi
nate wasteful construction practices, and deliver projects 
that will produce less waste in operation; 
• Pro
mote the circular economy by using products and materials 
that can easily be maintained, re-used or repurposed in the 
future, avoiding low grade recycling wherever possible;
• Proc
ure materials from certified responsible sources.
Waste 
BAM distinguishes its waste in excavation, demolition, construction 
and office waste. The Company considers excavation and demolition 
waste to be less relevant indicators of operational performance and 
sustainability as these types of waste are present at sites before the 
Company takes on a project. BAM has limited impact on the amounts 
of these waste types and it is merely a part of its business model to 
efficiently re-use or remove these materials.
BAM focuses on construction and office waste as performance 
indicators. All construction and office materials are initially 
brought to BAM’s sites and offices on its behalf, in contrast to 
excavation and demolition waste. In 2020, BAM produced less 
construction and office waste than in 2019, at 100 kilotonnes 
(2019:128 kilotonnes). The construction and office waste intensity 
was 14.6 tonnes per € million revenue, a 17% decrease compared 
to 2019 (construction and office waste intensity in 2019: 17.7).

BAM supports the focus on more ambitious targets to drive 
longer-term progress towards a low-carbon future. Emissions in the 
value chain outside BAM’s activities are an important aspect of a 
low-carbon future. BAM discloses these so-called scope 3 emissions 
as part of its CDP submission every year, which is publicly available 
on CDP’s website. The scope 3 assessment underlines the 
importance of scope 3 emissions and improves the understanding 
of BAM’s wider climate change impacts. The areas ‘purchased 
goods and services’ and ‘use of sold products’ contribute most to 
BAM’s scope 3 emissions and the Company engages with suppliers 
in exploring reduction measurements that focus on these areas.
Climate adaptation
Climate adaptation is gaining attention as an important aspect of 
corporate climate strategy. It relates to how companies deal with 
risks and opportunities associated with climate change. BAM 
addresses climate adaptation trough the assessment of climate 
change risks at project and business level and through its stage 
gate procedure. BAM discloses the full details of its climate change 
risk assessment in its CDP submission.
Identified key risks and opportunities in 2020 include:
•  Mar
ket-related risks and opportunities (e.g. changing client 
behaviour leading to an increased demand for low carbon 
products and zero energy solutions);
•  Pro
ducts- and services-related risks and opportunities (e.g. 
development of lower-carbon construction materials pushing 
the market to innovate and develop a lower carbon footprint);
•  Phy
sical weather conditions (e.g. adaptation to sea level rise by 
exploring potential future additional demands on water-land 
infrastructure, which is a core element of BAMs products and 
operations).
Reducing nitrogen emissions
By signing the Dutch ‘Malieveld’ agreement in 2019, BAM 
committed to nitrogen emission-free property development, 
design and construction. A challenge BAM identified in aiming to 
tackle nitrogen emissions is multidisciplinary cooperation 
throughout the construction sector (architects, real estate 
developers, construction companies and suppliers).

The largest contribution to this decrease was made in Belgium, 
and was caused by a more common project portfolio compared to 
2019: 2019 was a year of exceptionnally large waste volumes due 
to many large projects being in their finalisation phase at the 
same time. The wind-down of BAM International and temporary 
closure of construction sites due to Covid-19 also contributed to 
the decrease in construction waste. In most other countries, 
construction waste levels were only slightly lower in 2020 
compared to 2019. Efforts to improve the efficiency of the 
production process by the use of prefabricated building elements 
are ongoing.
BAM has set an objective to completely recycle or re-use its 
construction and office waste by 2025. In 2020, 76 per cent of 
BAM’s construction and office waste was recycled or re-used 
(2018: 75 per cent). A total of 15 kilotonnes (2019: 18 kilotonnes) 
was landfilled or incinerated without energy recovery. By 
engaging with its waste contractors, BAM pursues to improve the 
waste treatment process and further increase recycling and 
re-usage ratios. BAM also stimulates its projects and offices to 
improve waste separation and recycling/re-usage. 
Construction materials 
BAM has identified the quantities of materials used in its 
construction projects in the Netherlands, its largest home market, 
since 2011. The Company has identified the main categories of 
procured materials as shown in table 32. The material quantities 
and recycled content are based on supplier data, industry 
averages and data from BAM’s asphalt plants.
Circularity
Circularity is becoming an important topic in the construction 
sector and BAM is well placed in the industry to build on its past 
circular economic achievements. Within the Company, circularity is 
an upcoming theme with opportunities for new market potential, 
primarily in the Netherlands, Belgium and the United Kingdom. 
BAM is in the process of further defining its strategy towards 
circularity to demonstrate the opportunities and benefits through 
design, construction and operation of buildings and infrastructure 
assets using new circular economic business models. BAM’s main 
challenge is how to realise the transition from linear to circular 
patterns and increase the scale of circularity. Close collaboration 
with clients and supply chain partners is essential for BAM to seize 
circular opportunities.
An example of a circular initiative is the Taskforce Circular 
Development, which was started with the goal to investigate the 
circular challenge for the Dutch Construction and Property 
business. The taskforce researched circular trends and focus areas 
and created a benchmark to compare BAM’s current position with 
innovative disruptors in the industry. Within the Dutch Civil 
engineering business line, BAM is actively working on the 
development of integrated circular concepts and showcasing the 
benefits to clients.
In 2020, different circularity initiatives and products were rolled out. 
A few significant initiatives are described below:
• Cir
cular design and construction new head office CURE
In November 2020, BAM realised the new headquarter office for 
CURE waste management in the Netherlands. Waste is given a new 
lease of life in this new building. Innovative solutions in the field of 
re-use have been chosen. For example, the façade is cladded with 
recycled pallet wood and glass panels are made of partly recycled 
glass. In the façade, innumerable old concrete tiles have been sawn 
into masonry stones and the inner walls consist of recycled wood. 
The new CURE office is energy neutral: it can independently generate 
and distribute energy thanks to the 340 square metres of solar panels 
on the roof. A heat pump is also used that can heat and cool.
• King’s Cross Sports Hall, BAM’s first all-timber building
Th
is all-timber sports hall in King’s Cross, built by BAM Construct 
UK, is primarily constructed using a cross-laminated timber (CLT) 
frame and glulam timber columns, a natural alternative to steel 
and concrete that is both lightweight and carbon friendly. It is clad 
in zinc and has a super-lightweight concrete substructure.

encourage them to improve the identification and reporting of 
certified timber.
In 2020, BAM again reached a certified sustainable timber use of 
99 per cent. Although this is very close to the 2020 target of 
100 per cent sustainable timber use, BAM has not met this target 
as not yet all operations are covered. Over the past few years, BAM 
has improved the coverage of its timber use measurement to over 
80 per cent of its operations (based on revenue) in 2020. All home 
countries are covered, except Germany and Ireland. BAM has 
started measuring (sustainable) timber use in Germany in 2020, 
but the obtained figures are not yet sufficiently reliable to include 
in BAM’s overall figures. Obtaining certifications for sustainable 
timber in Germany and especially Ireland remains challenging, as 
the use of sustainable certificates as FSC and PEFC are not yet as 
common in those countries as in the Netherlands, Belgium and the 
United Kingdom. Sourcing only certified sustainable timber will 
remain an important sustainability target for BAM, and BAM aims 
continue its efforts to increase its coverage to 100 per cent.
In 2020, BAM used 99.5 per cent certified sustainable timber in 
the Netherlands (90 per cent FSC). Timber use by subcontractors 
and in subcontracted projects is not included. In the United 
Kingdom, 98.5 per cent of timber was from verified legal and 
sustainable sources, of which 91 per cent per cent was delivered 
with full FSC or PEFC Chain of Custody certification. Certified 
sustainable timber use in Belgium is estimated at 96.0 per cent 
and BAM International’s projects used 91.2 per cent sustainable 
timber.
In 2020, BAM obtained leadership status on the CDP forest timber 
benchmark (score A-). This global ranking evaluates corporate 
efforts to address and mitigate deforestation and forest 
degradation. The Company is recognised for its business strategy 
to only use certified sustainable timber, transparent reporting and 
progress towards achieving this target.

Designed to meet a near-zero carbon target, the building has 
several innovative features, including various methods of 
ventilation and the use of glazing to provide daylight while 
reducing heat gains. The building also benefits from its connection 
to the King’s Cross Central District Heating and Cooling Network, 
an efficient system for heating all the buildings at King’s Cross, 
which means that conventional boilers are not required.
Circular asphalt mixture LEAB
BAM’s sustainable process to produce low-energy asphalt 
concrete (LEAB) received the official seal of approval of CROW, the 
Dutch technology platform for transport, infrastructure and 
public space in April 2020. This certification by the experts of 
CROW’s asphalt quality steering group validates BAMs claims 
regarding reduced CO2 emissions, costs of environmental impact, 
civil engineering qualities and processability.
BAM’s asphalt plants have the capacity for large-scale sustainable 
production of almost every type of asphalt mixture, including 
circular LEAB. In 2020, BAM applied 56,706 tonnes of LEAB in the 
Netherlands, corresponding to five per cent of the total asphalt 
production (2019: 32,500 and three per cent). In total, BAM has 
already applied more than 680,000 tonnes of LEAB-produced 
asphalt in its projects in the Netherlands, thanks to the close 
collaboration with clients who are equally convinced of the value 
of this innovative and sustainable method of asphalt production. 
The application of LEAB is also increasingly being considered in 
BAM’s other home markets, most noticeably in the United 
Kingdom. A research trajectory with Highways England was 
successfully completed in 2020: English asphalt mixtures can be 
produced following the LEAB method with equal characteristics 
and quality as conventional asphalt mixtures. This is an important 
first step to apply LEAB asphalt in the United Kingdom.
In 2020, BAM and Heijmans agreed to transfer their existing 
asphalt plants in the Netherlands to a new joint asphalt company. 
By establishing this new asphalt company, the knowledge, 
expertise and investments in innovation of both companies will be 
combined. Increasing sustainability of the asphalt chain is an 
important objective, from lowering CO2 emissions to circularity 
and re-use of raw materials and semi-finished products. 
Collaboration offers opportunities to make better use of the 
available capacity and to improve the utilisation rate of the 
asphalt plants, aimed at efficiency and better returns.
Sustainable timber 
BAM considers sustainable timber a valuable construction 
material to support the transition to a circular economy. Besides, 
using sustainable timber is key to support forest conservation and 
biodiversity and helps to combat climate change. The Company 
has committed to FSC Netherlands to exclusively use certified 
sustainable timber for its projects. In cooperation with FSC 
Netherlands, BAM continues to engage with suppliers to

Markets
In the business line Construction and Property, the short-term 
investment sentiment deteriorated due to the Covid-19 crisis, 
especially from the private sector for new commercial buildings 
and retail space. The longer-term impact is currently difficult to 
forecast.
In the Netherlands, the demand for new homes continues to be 
larger than the supply while interest rates remain relatively low. 
Uncertainty regarding nitrogen and PFAS continues, which is 
causing delays in the issuance of building permits.
In the United Kingdom, competition has increased due to Covid-19 
and the end of the UK/EU transition period. Public sector clients 
continue as before, with competition for key new frameworks for 
health and education while there is a mixed picture for the private 
sector. Recently, BAM was appointed major Manchester hospital 
project under the Procure22 Health Framework and the contract 
for Sky Studios Elstree, the most sustainable film and TV studio in 
the world.
In Belgium the public building market is stable with opportunities 
in health care while the private market might come under 
pressure due to Covid-19. In Ireland, the construction outlook 
remains positive. The government continuous to focus on 
education and health care and Ireland remains an attractive home 
base for multinationals. The market in Germany remains generally 
stable but competitive. Most governments are expected to 
increase their investments in infrastructure in response to the 
Covid-19 crisis. 
In the business line Civil engineering, the Dutch market remains 
competitive and the uncertainty regarding nitrogen legislation 
and PFAS continues. BAM continues discussions with public sector 
clients in order to achieve an improvement in risk/reward balance 
of future projects. Until that is resolved, BAM remains extremely 
cautious about tendering for large projects.
In the United Kingdom, the expected growth across all 
infrastructure sectors in strengthening. In December, the 
Government published its Construction Playbook setting out how 
it will work with the construction sector to make sure public 
sector works are delivered faster, better and greener. As a leading 
player in United Kingdom construction, BAM will support the 
British recovery from the pandemic and its progress towards net 
zero carbon. There has been minimal disruption to BAM’s 
operations since the start of the new UK/EU trade agreement. The 
civil market in Belgium shows a mixed picture, with regional 
markets slowing due to lower spending of regional public clients 
and some larger projects in Flanders and Brussels. In Ireland, 
public sector investments in infrastructure are at a low level. 
Regarding Germany, the market is subdued but BAM’s existing 
order book is at a high level. 
3.4 Outlook
For BAM PPP, the pipeline of prospects and active bids remains 
healthy. In the longer term, BAM expects a global increase in 
government use of PPP/private finance models to stimulate 
economies and develop infrastructure assets. This will provide  
opportunities in new markets for the BAM PPP/PGGM joint 
venture.
Sustainability
Across operating companies in both business lines, sustainability 
is an increasingly important theme for BAM’s clients. For instance, 
in many markets the demand for alternative power generation, 
adjustments to distribution networks and zero-emission homes is 
sharply increasing. Instead of a construction-only focus, the 
demand for sustainable products and services and a trend towards 
lifecycle focus are on the rise.
The challenge for BAM is to improve its financial performance in 
the short term (2021), while simultaneously implement its 
sustainability strategy and achieve a net positive impact in the 
long term. BAM is further focusing on bringing down its own 
emissions and helping other parties in the value chain to reduce 
theirs. This is in line with BAM’s science-based CO2 reduction 
target (SBT) and the 2015 Paris Agreement. 
The concept of circularity is increasingly gaining attention in the 
construction sector. Linear consumption patterns (‘take-make-
dispose’) of products are beginning to cause constraints on the 
availability of resources. The construction sector needs to develop 
new opportunities and realise its circular economy ambitions 
faster, which requires a vigorous innovation of design and 
construction methods. 
Employees 
BAM continues to face a tight labour market, especially in the field 
of technology, where the Company finds it increasingly 
challenging to find skilled people. This will be addressed in BAM’s 
employer branding approach, in which specifically defined key 
target groups are made aware of relevant job opportunities and 
employee stories via recruitment marketing activities.
Simultaneously, BAM will continue to stimulate employee 
development by offering learning and personal development 
programmes. To understand the needs and interests of BAM’s 
employees, regular engagement surveys are held, and actions are 
defined based on the outcome of these. BAM focuses on fostering 
an attractive company culture to offer talent a rewarding career. 
Financing and investments
 
BAM will redeem the outstanding subordinated unsecured 
convertible bonds in June 2021. Under the new strategic plan 
2021-2023 (‘Building a sustainable tomorrow’), BAM will

restructure its portfolio of businesses to focus on markets and 
projects where it can leverage its proven competitive strengths 
and serve the growing demand for sustainable solutions in the 
construction sector. The company continues to invest in strategic 
initiatives and project specific equipment.
Outlook 2021
Looking ahead, for 2021 BAM sees signs of recovery in its markets, 
although there are differences in pace per country and sector, and 
Covid-19 related uncertainty persists. BAM will provide its outlook 
for 2021 in due course.

projects or projects involving exceptional risk are submitted to the 
Executive Board for ratification and – if necessary – to the 
Supervisory Board for approval. Apart from the various stage gate 
assessments, BAM’s Internal Audit department performs 
independent project reviews on selected projects across the 
Company to review the effectiveness of the project control system 
and the overall project performance. 
BAM’s risk management framework is reviewed on a semi-annual 
basis. In 2020 the review resulted in adjustments based on changes in 
the organisation, processes, systems (e.g. development shared 
services, new stage gate requirements, system improvements for 
tendering). These changes have been translated in new or updated 
policies, procedures and processes. They are also incorporated in the 
internal control framework as part of the yearly assessment cycle. 
The risk management and control systems provide a platform for the 
structured sharing of knowledge and expertise in the business, so 
that risk management plays a key role in achieving the strategic 
objectives. In line with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the 
COSO (Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway 
Commission) Enterprise Risk Management Framework from 2017 has 
been used as reference to further mature the risk management 
framework within BAM.
BAM’s risk management and internal control systems are supported 
by BAM’s core values. These values steer the behaviour of BAM’s 
people and help to ensure that BAM’s risk profile remains in line with 
the risk appetite.   
Risk profile and appetite
The Executive Board is responsible for establishing the risk appetite 
within BAM in relation to the strategy and activities of BAM. Risk 
appetite is defined as the level at which BAM is willing to accept risk 
in the ordinary course of business in order to achieve its objectives. 
The risk appetite is being discussed between the Supervisory Board 
and Executive Board as part of the discussion on the business and 
project portfolio, which is translated in a stricter selection of new 
opportunities and tenders. The risk appetite will be further assessed 
in relation to the development of the new strategic agenda to 
further de-risk the company. It has already been restricted, in 
particular with respect to large projects and the wind-down of BAM 
International, during 2020.
The risk appetite and main risk areas are described based on the 
following categories: 
• Strategic risks - BAM takes a balanced approach on risk and 
re
ward to achieve its strategic objectives in terms of results 
and innovation and continues to invest in innovation through 
digital technologies and digital construction.
• Ope
rational risks – BAM seeks to limit the risks that may 
jeopardise the execution of its business activities.
4. Risk management
In essence, doing business is an act of balancing business 
opportunities with risks and control activities. BAM has formal and 
standardised processes in place to facilitate and coordinate these 
activities. In this chapter BAM’s approach to risk management is 
explained. Additionally, an overview is provided of the main risks that 
BAM faces and what the Company is doing to mitigate them.
Risk management framework
BAM’s risk management framework, established by the Executive 
Board, covers the approach and responsibilities for risk management 
across the Company. The Executive Board has defined a strategy 
which focuses on the business and project portfolio. This portfolio 
focus and underlying strategic objectives and initiatives form the 
basis for BAM’s enterprise risk management. It addresses the 
Company’s strategic, operational, financial and compliance risks. 
Risks are assessed and prioritised on their impact and probability and 
on effectiveness of the controls of risk response in the organisation. 
The Supervisory Board monitors and advises the Executive Board, 
which has the overall responsibility for enterprise risk management 
within the Company.  
On behalf of the Executive Board, the Risk and Control Committee 
coordinates the set-up and effectiveness of the risk management 
framework. The Risk and Control Committee, chaired by the chief 
financial officer (CFO), advises the Executive Board on main risks in 
the context of BAM’s risk appetite. Risk assessments are carried out 
on a quarterly basis. An additional assessment has been performed 
for emerging and low-probability risks as a consequence of the Covid-
19 pandemic. Covid-19 has caused unprecedented challenges for 
society, our industry and BAM. BAM responded with a 
multidisciplinary crisis team to coordinate the risk mitigating 
measures, scenario planning, cross-operating company collaboration 
and monitoring. Lessons learned from the first Covid-19 wave were 
implemented as part of mitigation during the second wave. Also the 
uncertainty about Brexit continued during the year. BAM has 
performed a risk analysis on potential impacts from a contract, 
supply chain, trade tariffs and customs, regulation and people 
perspective, including follow-up actions to mitigate risks. The effect 
of Brexit so far remained limited.
A fundamental part of the BAM risk management framework is the 
stage gate process. Tenders and projects are guided through various 
stage gates, based on complexity, size and risk profile. The first two 
stages in the process focus on ‘Are we doing the right tender or 
project?’, while the other stages address the question ‘Are we doing 
the tender or project right?’  The stage gate process is designed to 
establish a clear risk profile and to support predictable performance 
across all BAM’s tenders and projects. Expert involvement is arranged 
to leverage the combined knowledge within the Company, 
supporting the tender and project in reaching its full potential. The 
stage gate process follows a governance structure based on risk 
categorisation, to ensure that each tender and project is reviewed 
and approved by the proper level of management. Bids for major

• Finance risks – BAM strives to maintain a solid financial position 
(e.g. solvability and credit facilities), ensuring access to the 
financial markets and retaining its clients, supply chain and other 
partners. BAM wants to provide an insightful, fair and accurate 
representation of its performance and economic results.
• Compliance risks – Compliance with all applicable laws and 
re
gulations including BAM’s Code of Conduct is of fundamental 
importance to the Company.
Risk appetite statements are further underpinned by BAM’s strategic 
agenda, governance, core values, Code of Conduct and policies and 
procedures. 
In control statement process
The effectiveness of the internal control framework is monitored in a 
semi-annual assessment of the requirements in the framework. BAM 
has derived its internal control framework from the business model 
(see page 9) and underlying key processes and policies (for 
accounting, treasury, legal, compliance, information security, and so 
on). All key processes are identified around strategic enablers and are 
aligned with existing core processes in accordance with these 
enablers. The internal control framework ensures insight into the 
effectiveness of internal risk management and control systems, as 
well as the reliability of financial reporting and compliance with laws 
and regulations. 
All operating companies and the headquarters carry out self-
assessments and the results are reported to the Royal BAM Group. 
These results are challenged, and improvement actions are 
implemented and monitored. Furthermore, internal audits challenge 
the results and provide recommendations to further improve the 
effectiveness of the internal control framework.
The in control statement process results in an end-of-year ‘Executive 
Board statement’ (see next paragraph). The underlying assessments 
on operating company level form the basis for management’s 
accountability for the effectiveness of the internal control framework, 
together with the formal issuance of a statement and letter of 
representation to the Executive Board. Any deviations from the 
internal control framework are highlighted, including identified 
follow-up actions to resolve these deviations.
All operating companies have confirmed and signed the letter of 
representation which supports the Executive Board in its assessment 
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the internal control 
and risk management systems. BAM has identified areas of 
improvement as BAM is not yet at the level of maturity it aspires to. 
Reported deviations included an improvement plan to further 
strengthen the level of control. The most important risk areas  which 
impacted BAM were health and safety, project execution risks and 
financial resilience. 
Executive Board statement  
The Executive Board is responsible for the design and operation of 
the internal risk management and control systems. In discharging 
this responsibility and to provide a substantiation for the 
statement below, the Executive Board has made an assessment of 
the effectiveness of the design and operation of the internal 
control and risk management systems (see previous paragraph). 
In addition, the Executive Board has determined an outlook based 
on market developments, orderbook, financing and cash flow 
(see page 42).
On the basis of this management report and in accordance with 
best practice 1.4.3 of the Dutch corporate governance code as 
adopted on 8 December 2016, and article 5:25c of the Financial 
Supervision Act (‘Wet op het financieel toezicht’), the Executive 
Board confirms that, to the best of its knowledge:
• The m
anagement report provides sufficient insights into any 
failings in the effectiveness of the internal risk management 
and control systems of Royal BAM Group;
• The a
forementioned systems provide reasonable assurance that 
the financial reporting does not contain any material 
inaccuracies;
• Bas
ed on the current state of affairs, it is justified that the 
financial reporting is prepared on a going concern basis; 
• The m
anagement report states those material risks and 
uncertainties that are relevant to the expectation of Royal BAM 
Group’s continuity for the period of 12 months after the 
preparation of the management report.
It should be noted that the above does not imply that these 
systems and procedures provide absolute assurance as to the 
realisation of operational and strategic business objectives, or that 
they can prevent all misstatements, inaccuracies, errors, fraud and 
non-compliances with legislation, rules and regulations. Nor can 
they provide certainty that we will achieve our objectives.
Furthermore, the Executive Board confirms that, to the best of its 
knowledge:
• The f
inancial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of Royal BAM 
Group and of companies included in the consolidation;
• The m
anagement report provides a fair review of the position at 
the balance sheet date, the development and performance of 
the business during the financial year of Royal BAM Group; 
• The m
anagement report describes the principal risks and 
uncertainties that Royal BAM Group faces.

Strategic risks
Market risk     
Most of the Company’s home 
markets are subject to fierce 
competition. 
Fierce competition may lead to a 
buyer’s market, which influences 
margins, causes a shift in design 
and contract risks for the 
contractor and endangers the 
pre-financing of projects by 
clients.
Based on the Company’s strategy, BAM 
applies a disciplined focus on market 
segments and projects where it can use 
either scale or expertise as a critical success 
factor. For its future business portfolio, BAM 
rationalises its propositions and develops 
new solutions for clients and invests in 
digitalisation to be a market leader in how 
and what BAM builds.
Transformation risk     
The strategic agenda involves a 
transition to a new organisation, 
so that BAM can follow the 
developments in the sector and 
be a leader in the selected 
markets.
BAM may not realise a successful 
and agile implementation of the 
defined transformation targets, 
together with other strategic 
initiatives and targets.
The Executive Board is closely steering and 
monitoring the progress of the 
transformation activities as defined in the 
strategic agenda and translated in the yearly 
operating plans. Furthermore, BAM has 
implemented a programme management 
organisation to steer transition progress.
Innovation risk     
The construction industry is at 
the brink of major technological 
changes. Digital technology is 
beginning to change value 
creation within the industry, 
where traditional capabilities 
may become commoditised.
Competitors or disruptive 
newcomers on the market can 
marginalise BAM’s distinctive 
capabilities and thus jeopardise 
the existing business model.
BAM’s management measures with regard to 
innovation risk are described in 
 paragraph 9.7, ‘Material themes and 
management approach’.
Pandemic risk     
The recent Covid-19 pandemic 
continues to evolve and has 
resulted in the implementation 
of significant measures by 
governments, including 
lockdowns, closures, quarantines 
and travel bans intended to 
control the spread of the virus.
Disruptions related to widespread 
public health concerns (e.g. 
Covid-19 pandemic) can 
materially adversely impact 
BAM’s results of operations.
The Executive Board is closely steering and 
monitoring this crisis, together with its 
multidisciplinary crisis team, with a focus on 
a safe and healthy working environment on 
project sites, in offices and at home, 
managing costs and capex, preserving cash 
and strengthening liquidity in cooperation 
with its key stakeholders.

Operational risks
Property development risk     
BAM is involved in property 
development for its own 
account. The level and timing of 
both income (sale/rent) and 
costs (site acquisition and 
building costs) of these projects 
may deviate from the initial 
expectations as a result of 
divergent market and process 
(planning/permits) conditions, 
for example due to the Covid-19 
crisis. 
Property development projects 
can be postponed or completed 
at higher costs than budgeted. 
Furthermore the realisable value 
of our land bank and property 
development positions may be 
lower than book value. Planned 
divestments of commercial 
property may take longer due to 
Covid-19 uncertainty. This has 
consequences for the financial 
results (level and duration of the 
capital employed, profit).
The Executive Board decides on the basis of 
project proposals in the Property Committee. 
The general rule is that construction does not 
start before a significant number of properties 
have been sold or, for non-residential 
buildings, a large part of the project has been 
rented out or sold. The Property Committee 
also closely monitors the right timing for 
divestments of property, especially in the area 
of commercial property, due to Covid-19 
uncertainty.
 
Safety risk     
The nature of BAM’s business can 
pose safety risks to its people. 
The well-being and safety of the 
people of BAM are of vital 
importance to the Company.
Safety incidents may lead to 
serious injuries, fatalities or 
project disturbance, loss of time 
or additional costs, and as a result 
impact BAM’s performance.
BAM’s management measures with regard to 
health and safety are described in
 paragraph 9.7, ‘Material themes and 
management approach’.
Project risk     
BAM is constantly active in 
thousands of projects where the 
Company is exposed to a wide 
variety of risks, in a sector 
known for its asymmetrical risk 
profile. Selecting the right 
projects against balanced 
contractual conditions is crucial.
Failure to achieve a healthy order 
intake and flawless project 
execution leads to fluctuations in 
the project results, possible 
claims and litigation and 
ultimately to the failure to 
achieve BAM’s strategic 
objectives.
BAM has implemented several measures to 
manage the project risk and to steer towards 
the desired risk appetite. The starting point is 
selective tendering with a focus on portfolio 
management, and a robust stage gate 
procedure for tenders and during the execution 
phase with focus on, among other things, 
design management, schedule management, 
contract management. During 2020 BAM 
further de-risked the company with the wind 
down of the activities of BAM International, 
which is operating outside the company’s 
European home markets, and with claim 
settlements to bring down open exposure to 
clients on variable considerations. 
Supply chain risk     
On an annual basis, BAM 
purchases more than 70 per cent 
of its turnover from suppliers 
and subcontractors. These 
partners have a major impact on 
the projects, both financially and 
technically.
Failure to manage the cost of the 
supply chain (subcontractors, 
materials and services) and 
insufficient access to qualified and 
cost-effective vendors has an 
impact on successful and profitable 
execution of the projects.
BAM’s management measures with regard to 
procurement and supply chain risk are 
described in  paragraph 9.7, ‘Material 
themes and management approach’.

People risk     
Attracting, training and 
retaining talented people is 
crucial for BAM, because it 
enables the Company to respond 
more effectively to changes in 
the market by exploiting its full 
potential. It is essential that BAM 
remains a preferred employer.
An inability to attract and keep 
the right talent, expertise and 
human capital within BAM will 
have a negative effect on success.
To attract top talent, BAM has a professional 
recruitment team that works together with 
external recruitment agencies. The Company 
invests in the development of employees 
through various training programmes, 
including a programme for management 
trainees, project directors and project 
managers, and prepares candidates for key 
positions to improve (inclusive) leadership.
Information technology risk     
Digitalisation, data, 
communication and 
connectivity are essential for 
BAM. A global presence also 
leads to cyber-security 
challenges, which require the 
Company to have the flexibility 
to continuously adapt.
Information technology is crucial 
in supporting and protecting the 
core and supporting processes. 
BAM increasingly relies on digital 
communication, connectivity and 
the use of technology. The 
Company has to remain alert to 
prevent the use of compromised 
data and the unavailability, loss or 
theft of critical strategic, financial 
and operational data.
BAM aims to improve the maturity of the IT 
function to keep up with external 
developments. In addition, BAM has 
increased its security efforts to remain 
resilient to growing cyber-risks. This includes 
implementing and testing of an information 
security framework to ensure confidentiality, 
integrity and continuity of data.
Sustainability risk     
The construction industry relies 
heavily on natural resources, 
which will be depleted when 
consumption goes faster than 
the natural supplement. 
Climate-related risks such as 
global warming cause more 
frequently occurring extreme 
weather conditions, such as 
storms, heat waves, droughts, 
heavy rainfall with flooding and 
heavy snowfall.
Failure to deliver sustainable 
construction processes and (new) 
sustainable solutions could 
disrupt BAM’s position related to 
clients and supply chain partners 
and lead to reduced revenue and 
higher costs. 
BAM has covered sustainability in its 
governance (corporate team and operating 
company teams), strategy (ambition to 
achieve a net positive result), project 
portfolio (reduce the impact of BAM on 
resource use in cooperation with partners in 
the supply chain and clients to explore 
circular economic business models), risk 
management (identify and manage potential 
risks and opportunities) and metrics (target 
as part of our strategic agenda). BAM reports 
on the Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) guidelines 
through its yearly CDP climate response, 
which is publicly available on the CDP 
website.

Finance risks
Financial risk     
The attractiveness of BAM as a 
trusted partner to collaborate 
with or to invest in is strongly 
influenced by its financial 
position and the ability to 
manage financial risks.
Failure to achieve the status of 
trusted partner may prevent BAM 
from working with preferred 
parties and lead to restrictions on 
access to financial markets. 
BAM has taken actions to mitigate financial 
risks following the extraordinary 
circumstances in 2020 to ensure sufficient 
liquidity to run its operations. There was 
additional focus on cash by implementing a 
cost-savings programme, limiting capex and 
obtaining available governmental support. 
Furthermore, the revolving credit facility 
(RCF) has been extended by one year to 
March 2024. The RCF was fully drawn as a 
precautionary measure in response to 
Covid-19, increasing flexibility and financial 
resilience. The extraordinary circumstances 
in 2020 required close monitoring of the 
relevant bank covenant ratios. As a result, 
BAM obtained a waiver from its lenders. 
Also, the bonding facilities have been closely 
monitored to ensure sufficient headroom under 
the credit facilities to issue bonds and bank 
guarantees. Furthermore, a major restructuring 
programme was initiated to deliver cost savings 
of €100 million annually. 
Other specific financial risk management 
measures, including those in the area of interest 
rate risk, foreign exchange risk, price risk, credit 
risk and liquidity risk are disclosed in note 3 of 
the financial statements. More information on 
deferred tax assets and liabilities is disclosed 
under note 24 of the financial statement , a 
specific tax risk is the expected enactment of 
the new tax rules in 2021 since the new 
legislation in the Netherlands has not been fully 
enacted as per 31 December 2020. When it 
substantially enacts in 2021, the actual impact 
will be further analysed.
Compliance risks
Reputation risk     
The trust of clients, shareholders, 
lenders, construction partners 
and employees in BAM is vital to 
ensure the continuity of the 
Company.
BAM’s reputation may be 
damaged if it fails to successfully 
mitigate the main reputational 
risks, such as fraud, bribery and 
corruption.
BAM’s management measures with regard to 
business conduct and transparency are 
described in  paragraph 9.7, ‘Material 
themes and management approach’.

What impacted BAM in 2020?
Some risks and uncertainties related to the nature and complexity 
of the business environment, but also opportunities had an 
impact on BAM in 2020. The major events are given in this section.
Safety
BAM is highly committed to preventing incidents. However, the 
company still faced incidents at project sites in 2020. BAM 
regrettably had to record one fatal occupational accident on a 
BAM site. This was extensively evaluated by operating company 
management, the Executive Committee and the Supervisory 
Board. Creating and maintaining a safe working environment 
remains a continuous focus area to reach the Group’s safety 
targets and to prevent incidents.
Asymmetric risk-reward balance
The results of some large projects in the Netherlands (civil 
engineering), Germany (construction), Ireland (construction) and 
its non-European activities (construction) were impacted by an 
asymmetric risk/reward balance, including discussions on 
variation orders. Due to Covid-19 and the mentioned performance 
of the Group in the first half of the year the Group obtained a 
waiver from the providers of the RCF for the recourse interest 
ratio and for the recourse leverage ratio. Furthermore, there were  
non-cash impairments of goodwill, property and deferred tax 
assets (DTA). BAM is defining a new strategic agenda in order to 
create more value for our shareholders and solid prospects for all 
our stakeholders, including our employees. In 2020, BAM already 
performed some de-risking and improvement initiatives that 
resulted in a somewhat better performance in German 
construction and Dutch civil engineering, while BAM also decided 
to wind down BAM International, active outside BAM’s European 
home markets, given the lack of a positive outlook. 
Covid-19 pandemic 
The extraordinary circumstances caused by the Covid-19 
pandemic had a considerable impact on BAM. BAM adapted to 
different governmental restrictions across our various markets in 
close cooperation with its stakeholders. The focus was on 
ensuring a safe working environment, reducing costs and capex, 
preserving cash and strengthening liquidity. BAM has been able to 
safeguard the health of its employees and no BAM employees 
deceased due to Covid-19 in 2020. However, the various markets 
were impacted, which resulted in a decrease in operational 
efficiency, especially during the second quarter of 2020. Revenue 
was most heavily impacted in Construction and Property in 
Belgium, Ireland and the United Kingdom, where governments 
had imposed lock-downs. The liquidity position and trade working 
capital efficiency remained strong.
Restructuring
In September 2020,  BAM announced a major restructuring 
programme aimed at mitigating the lower revenue caused by 
Covid-19 and selective tendering. BAM expects this programme to 
result in cost savings of €100 million annually. The majority of 
savings will come from headcount reductions. BAM expects to see 
significant savings as soon as in 2021.
Settlement of material claim with the City of Cologne
BAM’s operating company Wayss & Freytag Ingenieurbau reached 
agreement on a long-standing and highly complex claim with the 
City of Cologne and de-risked BAM with this settlement. Wayss & 
Freytag Ingenieurbau was a one-third partner in the joint venture 
carrying out this project. The joint venture (‘Arge’) constructed a 
section of Cologne’s North/South metro line and reached an 
agreement to settle all outstanding claims with regard to this 
project, including damages caused by the collapse of the building 
of the City archives on 3 March 2009. A substantial part of Wayss 
& Freytag Ingenieurbau’s share was covered by insurance 
payments and the remaining part (€36 million) is taken as an 
exceptional charge in the 2020 accounts.
Extended partnership between BAM PPP and PGGM
BAM extended its long-term PPP partnership with Dutch pension 
fund service provider PGGM. A first step was during the half-year 
period with a positive financial impact. The second step was, 
when PGGM Infrastructure Fund acquired a 50 per cent interest in 
BAM PPP. The extended partnership is expected to generate 
significant potential to accelerate growth in existing European and 
new global markets by providing BAM PPP with a broader remit 
and greater flexibility to expand its portfolio. Closing this 
transaction resulted in an increase of shareholders’ equity and 
strengthened the financial resilience of BAM in 2020.

objectives, (2) how the policy has been implemented and (3) the 
results of the policy in the past financial year.
Since the implementation of the new Code in 2017, the profile 
for the Supervisory Board holds diversity aspects, including a 
clear target for gender participation. This target of at least 
30 per cent female and at least 30 per cent male members of 
the Supervisory Board does not differ from the target set in the 
previous profile. Since the general meeting in 2017, the 
composition of the Supervisory Board has been in line with this 
target. Per 31 December 2020 three out of seven members are 
female. Besides gender, diversity in background, nationality, 
expertise and experience in the Supervisory Board are equally 
important in order to provide most value. The Supervisory 
Board meets these diversity requirements. 
The Supervisory Board has resolved that the diversity aspects 
set in the profile for the Supervisory Board will apply equally to 
the Executive Board and the Executive Committee. Regrettably, 
the composition of the Executive Committee is not (yet) in line 
with the target as far as gender participation is concerned as the  
Executive Committee currently only consists of male members. 
In the search for suitable candidates for the Executive 
Committee, the Supervisory Board put a great deal of emphasis 
on identifying female candidates in order to ensure we had the 
very best talent available. This was expressed in the instructions 
to the external recruitment agency and in the subsequent 
review of the resumes and candidates. In the end however, it 
proved very difficult to identify and attract female candidates. 
Given the above, it was concluded that even more emphasis 
should be put on this topic. In order to put this into effect, a 
director for diversity and inclusion has been appointed, with 
the CEO taking the lead as sponsor of diversity and inclusion. 
A BAM-wide programme for diversity and inclusion will be 
developed and implemented. BAM will increase its attention 
to women in our management development programmes to 
assure that the rise of women to our senior management

Sustainability, responsibility and delegation
The Executive Board is responsible for defining the sustainability 
policy, in consultation with the director for strategy, sustainability  
and innovation and the management of the operating companies.
Meetings with senior management are used to define 
sustainability issues, prioritise objectives, monitor activities and 
report results. Critical concerns are reported to the Executive 
Board at least in quarterly reports, or whenever more urgency is 
required. The Executive Board communicates to the Supervisory 
Board according planned reporting cycles, or whenever more 
urgency is required. Topics such as the reduction of CO2 emissions 
and waste, enhancing lives, along with business integrity and 
safety, apply to all BAM operating companies. 
Each operating company has a management team member who 
shares responsibility for BAM’s sustainability activities. The 
operating companies report progress quarterly to the Executive 
Board and the director for strategy, sustainability and innovation, 
together with details of actions taken to support the Company’s 
business objectives. Progress against targets is reviewed and when 
necessary, additional actions are taken to ensure BAM’s 
sustainability targets are pursued and met. 
positions is warranted. In addition, external recruitment 
agencies are instructed to identify capable female candidates 
for senior management positions. Finally, the Company will give 
preference to women in case of equal suitability in support of 
positive action.
New KPIs have been put in place in order to track and encourage 
growth in the numbers of new female hires, women in senior 
leadership roles and the overall female demographic. These 
apply to all of the BAM operating companies and will provide 
stretch of performance. A review of our senior talent has shown 
an increase in female representation in succession plans, with a 
target ratio of 1:3 women to men and BAM continues to monitor 
and improve on this. Notwithstanding the above, it should be 
noted that especially at the executive level, achieving the 
gender target is proving to be difficult due to the nature of the 
business and the lack of female candidates with sufficient 
management experience in the construction industry. It is 
therefore difficult to predict when this target is likely to be 
achieved. 
However, it is within our gift to consider future needs today, and 
diversity has a major focus in how BAM is planning what the 
future leadership will, and needs to look like.

5.2 Decree on Article 10 of the Takeover Directive
Association. See  paragraph 8.3 for Articles of Association 
provisions governing the distribution of profit.
Limits on the transfer of shares
The Company has no limitation, under the Articles of Association 
or by contract, on the transfer of shares or depositary receipts 
issued with the Company’s cooperation, apart from the restriction 
on the transfer of preference shares B. Article 13 of the Company’s 
Articles of Association stipulates that approval is required from 
the Company’s Executive Board for the transfer of preference 
shares B. The scheme is included in order to offer the Company 
the facility – because of the specific purpose of issuing these 
shares, namely the acquisition of finance or achieving protection 
– of offering the holders of these shares an alternative in the event 
that they wish to dispose of their shares.
As regards the preference shares B, the Company and Stichting 
Aandelenbeheer BAM Groep (Foundation Preference Shares BAM 
Group) have agreed that the Company will not proceed to issue 
these shares or to grant any rights to purchase them to anyone 
other without the foundation’s permission. The foundation will not 
dispose of or encumber any preference shares B, nor renounce the 
voting rights relating to them, without permission from the 
Company. See page 198 onward with regard to the reasons behind 
protecting the Company and the manner in which this is done.
Substantial interests
The Company is aware of the following interests in its equity, 
which are now reported under the provisions concerning the 
reporting of controlling interests under the Disclosure of the 
Financial Supervision Act. See   table 48 on page 202.
Special control rights
The shares into which the Company’s equity is divided are not 
subject to any special control rights.
Employee share or employee option plan
The Company does not have any employee share or employee 
option plans other than the long-term incentive plan based on 
performance shares which has been introduced for the members 
of the Executive Board in 2015. This long-term incentive plan is 
cascaded down to a maximum number of fifteen senior executive 
positions below the Executive Board.
Voting rights
Each share in the Company provides entitlement to the casting of 
one vote at shareholders’ meetings. There are no restrictions on 
the exercising of voting rights. The Company’s Articles of 
Association contain the usual provisions in relation to intimation 
for the purpose of being acknowledged as a proxy at shareholders’ 
meetings. Where the Articles of Association mention holders of 
depositary receipts or depositary receipt holders, whether named 
or bearer, this is understood to mean holders of depositary 
receipts issued with the Company’s cooperation and also 
This chapter relates to the provisions of the decree of 5 April 2006 
implementing article 10 of Directive number 2004/25/EC of the 
European Parliament and the Council of the European Union dated 
21 April 2004 and lastly revised on 13 October 2015 (‘the Decree 
of Article 10 of the EU Takeover Directive’).
Capital structure
The Company has three classes of shares: ordinary shares, 
preference shares B and series of preference shares F. BAM shares 
are traded on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange. Note 16 
of the financial statements may be used as a reference for the 
Company’s capital structure. At the balance sheet date only 
ordinary shares were issued. The following rights attached to the 
shares into which the Company’s capital is divided follow from the 
Articles of Association and the Dutch Civil Code. There is no 
difference in the voting rights attached to a preference share B, a 
preference share F or an ordinary share. As all ordinary shares and 
preference shares B and F have the same nominal value (EUR 0.10), 
every issued and outstanding share of a class gives the right to 
cast one vote in the general meeting and to cast one vote in the 
meeting of holders of that specific class. Ordinary shares and 
preference shares F may only be issued against payment in full. 
Preference shares B may be issued against partial payment. 
Holders of ordinary shares have a pre-emptive right in respect of 
new ordinary shares to be issued, unless restricted or excluded 
pursuant to a resolution of the General Meeting. Holders of 
ordinary shares do not have a pre-emptive right in respect of new 
preference shares to be issued. Holders of preference shares B and 
F do not have a pre-emptive right in respect of shares to be issued. 
The transfer of ordinary shares and preference shares F is not 
restricted by the Articles of Association. The transfer of preference 
shares B requires the approval of the Executive Board. 
The relevant financial right attached to the shares which follows 
from Article 31 of the Articles of Association concerns the 
application of the profit in relation to preference shares B and F. 
A brief summary of Article 31 of the Articles of Association
From the profit realised in any financial year, an amount will first 
be distributed, where possible, on the Class B cumulative 
preference shares, calculated by applying the percentage stated 
below to the amount that must be paid up on those shares as at 
the start of the financial year for which the distribution is made. 
The percentage referred to above will be equal to the average of 
the Euribor rates for money market loans with a maturity of 
twelve months – weighted according to the number of days for 
which these rates prevailed – during the financial year for which 
the distribution is made, plus one percentage point. Euribor refers 
to the Euro Interbank Offered Rate as determined and published 
by the European Central Bank.
Subsequently, if possible, a dividend will be distributed on each 
financing preference share of a certain series, with due 
consideration of the provisions of Article 31(6) of the Articles of 
56Integrated Report 2020 Royal BAM Group nv

Change of control provisions in important agreements
BAM differentiates the following categories of agreements as 
referred to in the Decree on Article 10 of the EU Takeover 
Directive:
• The C
ompany has entered into syndicated revolving credit 
facilities (RCF). See for further details note 19 of the financial 
statements. The RCF agreements stipulate that in the event of a 
change of control, the loans/amounts outstanding under these 
arrangements are immediately due;
• In Ju
ne 2016, Royal BAM Group issued €125 million in 
subordinated unsecured convertible bonds (see note 19 of the 
financial statements). This agreement also contains a change of 
control which gives the holder of each bond the right to require 
BAM to redeem that bond;
• Roy
al BAM Group and its subsidiaries have entered into various 
important agreements that contain clauses that in the event of 
a change of control the other party has the right to terminate 
the agreement. These agreements are in itself not considered 
key agreements within the meaning of the Decree on Article 10 
of the EU Takeover Directive, but jointly they are considered 
significant;
• The t
erms and conditions of the conditional performance share 
plan stipulate that, upon the occurrence of a change of control, 
the Supervisory Board may decide to vest the conditional 
Performance Shares accelerated on a prorated basis, both in 
terms of time and performance. The Supervisory Board is 
however also authorised to withdraw conditional and 
unconditional performance shares in exchange for a cash 
payment at market value.
individuals who, under the terms of Articles 88 or 89, Book 2 of 
the Dutch Civil Code, have the rights accorded to holders of 
depositary receipts for shares issued with the Company’s 
cooperation.
Shareholders’ agreements
The Company is not aware of any agreements involving one of  
the Company’s shareholders and which might provide reasons 
for:
• Res
tricting the transfer of shares or of depositary receipts 
issued with the Company’s cooperation, or
• Res
tricting the voting rights.
Appointment and dismissal of members of the Supervisory Board 
and members of the Executive Board and amendment of the Articles 
of Association
The Company is obliged by law to operate a mitigated two-tier 
structure. The General Meeting appoints the members of the 
Supervisory Board, based on a recommendation from the 
Supervisory Board. The General Meeting also appoints the 
members of the Executive Board, with the Supervisory Board 
having the right of recommendation. A more detailed 
explanation of the appointment and dismissal of members of 
the Supervisory Board and members of the Executive Board can 
be found in the Articles of Association of the Company. 
Resolutions to amend the Articles of Association or to dissolve 
the Company may only be adopted by the General Meeting 
pursuant to a proposal of the Executive Board and subject to the 
approval of the Supervisory Board.
Powers of the Executive Board 
The Executive Board’s powers are those arising from legislation 
and regulations. A more detailed description of the Executive 
Board’s duties can be found in the rules of the Executive Board 
and the Executive Committee. The Executive Board was 
authorised by the General Meeting held on 15 April 2020 to 
issue ordinary shares and Class F preference shares and/or to 
grant options to purchase these shares, subject to approval 
from the Supervisory Board. This authorisation is limited in 
duration to eighteen months. It is also limited in scope to 10 
per cent of the issued capital. 
The General Meeting held on 15 April 2020 granted authority to 
the Executive Board for a period of eighteen months to 
repurchase shares in the Company, within the limitations 
imposed by the law and the Articles of Association and subject 
to the approval of the Supervisory Board. In principle, the 
General Meeting is asked to grant these authorisations every 
year. Resolutions to amend the Articles of Association, or to 
dissolve the Company may only be passed by the General 
Meeting on the basis of a proposal put forward by the Executive 
Board and approved by the Supervisory Board.

6.1 Report of the Supervisory Board to shareholders 
As for many other companies and society at large, the year 2020 
was very turbulent for Royal BAM Group, with many developments 
and events. The extraordinary circumstances caused by the 
Covid-19 crisis had a considerable impact on all home markets of 
the Company due to reduced operational efficiency and additional 
costs. The effect was however significantly stronger in countries 
with a temporary lockdown, such as Belgium and Ireland. As a 
precautionary measure, the Company drew down the full recourse 
credit facility in March in order to strengthen its cash position. The 
Company obtained a waiver on the interest and leverage ratios 
from the lending banks due to the possible breach of the recourse 
interest ratio convenant. In addition, non-essential capital 
expenditure was cut, and Company-tied costs were reduced. The 
Executive Committee took the difficult decision to wind down BAM 
International, active outside BAM’s European home markets, 
following continued losses over the last years, the deterioration of 
the oil and gas market, the lack of attractive alternative 
opportunities and the unbalanced risks and rewards of the projects. 
Besides the continued losses at BAM International, the Group’s 
performance in the first half year was also impacted by the 
long-running Cologne metro settlement and to a lesser extent by 
underperformance of the German construction and Dutch civil 
engineering business. As a result, the Company reported for the 
first half of 2020 an adjusted loss before tax of €134 million. 
Although the results in the second half of the year improved, an 
adjusted result before tax for the full year of €34 million is highly 
disappointing. With the extension of the strategic partnership 
with PGGM through its participation in BAM’s PPP-vehicle, BAM 
has preserved its opportunities to monetise its international 
experience and know-how of the PPP market. This is considered to 
be a strategic pillar for the future of BAM to operate beyond its 
home markets whilst de-risking the international exposure in the 
construction itself.
In September BAM announced a major restructuring programme 
in order to mitigate lower revenue caused by Covid-19 and by a 
more selective approach to tendering. This programme aims to 
reduce costs by €100 million annually with most savings coming 
from substantial headcount reductions.
2020 was also a year that saw a substantial number of changes in 
the executive bodies of the Company. After the Supervisory Board 
took the decision not to nominate Rob van Wingerden for another 
term of four years as chief executive officer (CEO), Chief Financial 
Officer (CFO) Frans den Houter did an excellent job in steering the 
Company through the difficult period caused by Covid-19, while 
Supervisory Board member Paul Sheffield assisted the Executive 
Committee in his capacity as a delegated member (‘gedelegeerd 
commissaris’) of the Supervisory Board. In September, Ruud 
Joosten started as the new CEO with the key priority to develop a 
new strategy that will make BAM a more profitable and stable 
company. The process of developing this new strategy, in which 
the Supervisory Board was closely involved, has resulted in a new 
three-year strategic plan which will be presented to the market in 
February 2021.
The composition of the Supervisory Board changed considerably. 
After eight and nine years of membership respectively, Harrie Noy 
and Carla Mahieu stepped down. The Supervisory Board and the 
Company are grateful for their dedication and contribution over 
this long period of involvement with the Group. With the 
appointments of Denise Koopmans and Bob Elfring as Board 
members and Henk Rottinghuis taking over chairmanship from 
Harrie Noy  in August, the Supervisory Board has brought in new 
capabilities and experience. 
The decision to wind down BAM International, the impact of 
Covid-19 and the Group-wide restructuring programme have all 
had a major impact on BAM’s greatest asset, its employees. The 
resilience and dedication of the workforce has filled the 
Supervisory Board with gratitude, and we cannot thank our 
people enough for their contribution in this difficult year. 
2020 Financial statements and dividend
This integrated report, which is based on the International Integrated 
Reporting Framework, includes the 2020 financial statements, duly 
prepared by the Executive Board. The financial statements have been 
audited by the external auditor, Ernst & Young Accountants LLP; the 
unqualified independent auditor’s report is included in paragraph 8.1 
of this report.
The Audit Committee discussed the draft financial statements with 
the CEO, the CFOand the external auditor. The Audit Committee also 
discussed the auditor’s report, the management letter and the 
quality of internal risk management and control systems and had a 
discussion with the external auditor without BAM’s management 
being present. Subsequently, the Supervisory Board discussed this 
integrated report, including the financial statements with the 
Executive Board in the presence of the external auditor. We took 
note of the reporting from the Audit Committee and reviewed the 
auditor’s report and the quality of internal risk management and 
control systems. We concluded that we agree with the 2020 financial 
statements. 
Given the financial performance of the Company, the Supervisory 
Board concurs with the proposal of the Executive Board not to 
distribute a dividend over the year 2020, in line with the existing 
dividend policy. This decision was not taken lightly, also 
considering that BAM would apply for governmental support.
The Supervisory Board recommends the Annual General Meeting, 
to be held on 14 April 2021, to adopt the 2020 financial 
statements. We are of the opinion that the financial statements, 
the report by the Executive Board and the report by the 
Supervisory Board provide a solid basis on which to hold the 
Executive Board accountable for the management policies pursued

The Supervisory Board continues to support management’s 
position that BAM will no longer tender for projects where the 
rewards are not in line with the risks it is willing to assume. We 
frequently see that large civil projects are put on the market with a 
poor balance between risks and opportunities. The Board calls 
upon the governments in some of BAM’s home markets to adjust 
their approach to the market. Continuation of the current approach 
will ultimately lead to a definite withdrawal from this market of 
major projects. 
  
Considering the impact that the new BAM strategy may have, the 
operating companies and corporate functions prepared operating 
plans for 2021, which were consolidated into the operating plan for 
the Company. The Supervisory Board discussed the outlines and 
2021 priorities in its meeting in November and approved the 2021 
operating plan in an extraordinary meeting in December 2020.   
Risk management
As proper risk management is the key to predictable performance 
and therefore shareholder value, this continued to be high on the 
Board’s agenda. De-risking a portfolio with long-running projects 
is BAM’s first priority. The tender stage gate process plays a 
pivotal role in the early identification of potential risks and taking 
appropriate measures to mitigate at the tendering level. The 
Supervisory Board closely monitored the continuous development 
and improvement of this process and fully supported 
and the Supervisory Board accountable for its supervision on these 
policies. The members of the Supervisory Board have signed the 
financial statements in accordance with their statutory obligations 
under article 2:101, paragraph 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. 
Strategy and operational plan
The year 2020 marked the end of BAM’s strategy for the period 
2016–2020, ‘Building the present, creating the future’. In this 
period the Company has not been able to deliver results within 
the strategic target of two per cent to four per cent, 
notwithstanding strengthening of tender and project 
management processes and other initiatives, such as the 
introduction of One BAM initiatives, which are aimed at improving 
management control and reaping the benefits of scale by sharing 
knowledge, resources, systems, processes and innovations across 
the Group.
Together with the Executive Committee under its new leadership, 
we have concluded that more fundamental and rigorous choices 
must be made. The new strategy incorporates these choices. The 
chances we see for BAM are based on its market position in 
specific segments and countries, as well as on the undeniable 
trends towards sustainability and solutions for climate change. 
The Supervisory Board feels the Company is well positioned 
because of its innovative capability and highly developed 
engineering skills.

management’s actions to become more critical and selective 
in the early phase of tendering processes. We reviewed these 
projects with a main focus on risks, how these were managed 
and how these impacted the pricing of the projects. A well-
defined risk appetite should align all layers of management and 
prevent different interpretations of the amount of risk that is 
deemed appropriate.
There has also been close attention to the effects of the 
implementation of the Uniform Project Approach (UPA) for 
strengthening the execution of large existing projects. Next to its 
customary activities and reviews of internal processes, the 
Internal Audit team continued with auditing a number of 
high-exposure projects, resulting in recommendations to improve 
project control. 
As part of the Supervisory Board’s annual risk management 
review, we discussed in our November meeting the outcome of 
the enterprise risk management assessment in the presence of 
the governance, risk and compliance officer. This annual 
assessment provides an overview of the biggest risks the 
Company is facing in relation to achieving its objectives, both 
strategic and operational. The top five risks and related 
mitigation measures were discussed. The governance, risk and 
compliance officer also informed the Board about the status of 
the adherence to the BAM requirements framework, which is 
used to assess the internal risk management and control system 
throughout the Company. 
The Supervisory Board concluded that the Company has in place 
internal risk management and control systems, financial reporting 
manuals and procedures for drawing up financial reports, as well 
as an established monitoring and reporting system.
Safety and sustainability
The Supervisory Board agrees with the Executive Board that safety 
has the highest priority for BAM, its people, supply chain 
employees and societies at large. We regret that the Company had 
to report one fatality in Belgium in the second half of 2020. We 
discussed this tragic accident with management extensively and 
appreciated how it was handled and lessons learned were applied.
This fatality and other (serious) accidents that occurred show that 
safety requires permanent attention. Although the number of 
serious accidents dropped by 22 per cent, smaller (lost-time) 
accidents did not decrease proportionally. The 2020 incident 
frequency (IF) was adversely affected by the Covid-19-related 
fluctuation in reported hours and the Company anticipates a 
strong improvement in 2021 as it continues to embed its 
operational safety standard in each geography. It remains the 
Group’s overall aspiration to progressively achieve and improve on 
an average of 3.5 in the short to medium term. Performance varies 
within the Company, which will be a point of attention in 2021.
The Board fully supports management in its continuous efforts to 
further increase safety, not only through guidelines and 
instructions but especially by giving it consistent management 
attention and emphasizing the behavioural aspects. We took note 
of the positive feedback on Worldwide BAM Safety Day, which is 
meant to increase awareness of the importance of safety.
In order to further support attention to matters such as safety and 
sustainability, the Supervisory Board in December resolved to 
establish a committee for health, safety and sustainability (HSS) as 
per 2021, which will be a permanent committee of the 
Supervisory Board. In next year’s report, we will provide more 
information on the activities and composition of this committee.
Shareholders and investor relations
The Board highly values an open and regular dialogue with 
shareholders and investors to explain the Company’s strategy 
and performance and to receive feedback. We regularly 
reviewed BAM’s investor relations activities and shareholder 
base and were informed on the feedback given by shareholders, 
investors and analysts. We also took note of analyst reports 
regarding the Company.
Together with the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board 
prepared the Annual General Meeting in April and Extraordinary 
General Meeting in August which were evaluated afterwards. We 
were pleased to note that all proposals were adopted.
The importance of a satisfactory relationship with the financial 
markets is high on our agenda, as we realise that the results of 
BAM over the last years have been disappointing for shareholders.
Corporate governance
Each year, at the time of the publication of the integrated report, 
an updated corporate governance compliance overview is 
published on BAM’s website, providing transparency on how BAM 
complies with the Code. The Supervisory Board and the Executive 
Board are of the opinion that Royal BAM Group’s corporate 
governance is up to standard. Please refer to the corporate 
governance statement in this integrated report.
Discussions with external auditor
BAM’s auditor Ernst & Young Accountants LLP reported on its 2019 
audit, attended the quarterly meetings with the Audit Committee 
as well as the Annual General Meeting of 15 April 2020 digitally 
(due to Covid-19 restrictions). In the course of 2020, we assessed 
the performance of and relationship with the external auditor, 
based upon feedback from the Executive Board, the evaluation 
and recommendation of the Audit Committee and the feedback of 
the Company and operating company finance leaders. Based on 
this assessment, our experience with the external auditor and the 
external auditor’s expertise with regard to the construction

industry in general and Royal BAM Group in particular, we 
recommended the General Meeting to re-appoint Ernst & Young 
Accountants LLP as external auditor responsible for auditing the 
2021 financial statements of Royal BAM Group, which the General 
Meeting subsequently approved.
The audit plan for 2020 was presented to and discussed with the 
Audit Committee and the full Supervisory Board and subsequently 
approved. During the review of the 2019 full-year results and the 
2020 half-year results, the Board met with Ernst & Young 
Accountants LLP to discuss its reports. In an effective and open 
relationship, the Supervisory Board established that the external 
auditor received the financial information on which the financial 
reports were based in a timely manner and noted that the 
external auditor had discussed the information provided with BAM 
officers and the Executive Board. We took note of the reports and 
management letters as prepared by the external auditor and 
focused upon the follow-up of the identified action points.
We were happy to note that, although certain items still need to 
be addressed, the auditor reported a constant improvement in 
quality of our accounting systems and financial reporting. The 
Supervisory Board acknowledges the efforts made by the CFO and 
all those who contributed to this achievement.
In its February 2020 meeting, the Supervisory Board discussed 
with the external auditor and the Executive Board the areas of 
emphasis related to the 2019 annual reporting as identified by the 
auditor, being: valuation of projects and revenue recognition 
(including variation orders and claims), sensitivities and estimates 
with respect to the valuation of goodwill and deferred tax assets, 
other tax- and assurance-related topics, adoption of IFRS 16 and 
the financial statement closing process. Several of these topics 
were also discussed with the external auditor during the 
subsequent quarters in 2020. Following the results of the second 
quarter, in the August meeting, we discussed formally and in more 
depth the analysis on the Company’s going concern, the 
compliance with the agreed bank covenants, the different project 
positions, including related accounting treatment, and the 
development in the quality of the (financial) risk management. In 
addition, compliance with laws and regulations were discussed.  
Other activities and meetings
In addition to the items mentioned before, in each of its regular 
meetings, the Supervisory Board discussed with the Executive 
Committee the state of affairs, the financial performance of BAM 
and the operating companies, development of critical projects, 
market developments and order intake, working capital and cash 
flow, the financial condition of the Company as reflected by the 
balance sheet, investments and divestments and the quarterly 
press releases. If applicable, the meetings also featured a report 
on what had been discussed in meetings of the committees of 
our Board.
Other matters discussed included the integrated report and 
financial statements for 2019, the 2020 half-year report and 
interim statements, the reserve and dividend policy and the 
dividend proposal for 2019, the various effects of changes in the 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) on BAM’s 
financial reports, as well as compliance reports and material legal 
proceedings in which the Company is engaged.
The Executive Committee regularly updated us on the situation 
regarding a number of critical projects and tenders. In a number 
of instances, management of operating companies and key staff 
involved were invited to provide further information. Discussions 
focused mainly on the risks in these projects and how these are 
managed and/or could be mitigated. 
Besides the regular matters to address, the Supervisory Board in 
2020 spent ample time on a number of specific topics, which 
included the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the employees 
and operations, the drawing of the recourse credit facility, 
compliance with banking covenants and subsequent process to 
receive waivers, the settlement of the Cologne metro claim, the 
profit warning in July, the decision to start the process of winding 
down BAM International, the process to nominate Ruud Joosten as 
CEO, the Group-wide restructuring programme, the extended 
cooperation with PGGM through the sale of 50 per cent of BAM 
PPP and the strategy process. We also discussed and agreed with 
the proposal to join forces with Heijmans for asphalt production in 
the Netherlands. 
A delegation of the Supervisory Board met with the Central Works 
Council on several occasions. 
The Supervisory Board actively engages with the Executive 
Committee as well as other senior management in order to ensure 
we receive the right information. The chairman of the Board had 
regular contact with the CEO and the chairman of the Audit 
Committee with the CFO. The chairman and other members met 
with senior managers in order to be briefed on specific topics such 
as HR, finance, corporate governance, internal audits on the 
tender stage gate process (TSGP) and Uniform Project Approach 
(UPA). In February the Supervisory Board decided to appoint Paul 
Sheffield as a delegated board member in order to support and 
advise the Executive Committee in the crisis caused by Covid-19 
and the period until a new CEO was appointed. He held this 
position until 1 November. The Supervisory Board is very grateful 
for his dedication and contribution. In addition to the regular 
Board meetings, we have introduced periodical educational 
sessions in order to take deep dives on specific topics relevant for 
the Company and the industry. 
We approved the remuneration report prepared by the 
Remuneration Committee. The remuneration report is included in 
paragraph 6.2 of this integrated report. The remuneration policy 
was amended slightly, as the current arrangement regarding

post-employment benefits for Executive Board members was 
replaced by a pension contribution which is based on an age 
independent flat rate of 22 per cent of fixed remuneration. This 
change was approved by shareholders in the extraordinary general 
meeting on 24 August.
The Executive Committee decided independently of the 
Supervisory Board to cut its members’ salaries at the outbreak of 
the Covid-19 crisis. As one of the few listed companies, BAM saw 
both its boards independently from each other take a voluntary 
discount of 20 per cent on base salary. As of the fourth quarter the 
levels were adjusted to their agreed conditions.
In 2020, the Supervisory Board met on 13 occasions in the 
presence of the Executive Board or Executive Committee. In 
addition, a number of telephone conference calls between the full 
Supervisory Board or delegated members and the Executive Board 
took place in relation to the developments regarding Covid-19, 
performance of the Executive Committee, the Cologne metro 
claim and the financial situation of the Company. 
The attendance rate of the individual members at the meetings 
was as follows:

The Supervisory Board met five times without the Executive Board 
being present, to discuss the CEO succession, to evaluate the 
functioning of the Executive Board, to perform its self-assessment, 
to discuss key vacancies in the boards and the remuneration policy 
and remuneration of the Executive Board, including the 
determination of the variable portion of their remuneration for 
2019 and the targets for 2020.
The Supervisory Board’s committees
The Supervisory Board has three permanent committees: the Audit 
Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the Nomination 
Committee. It is the task of these committees to support and 
advise the Supervisory Board concerning items under the 
committees’ responsibility and to prepare the Supervisory Board’s 
decisions regarding those items. The Supervisory Board as a whole 
remains responsible for the way in which it performs its tasks and 
for the preparatory work carried out by the committees. The 
committees submitted reports on their meetings to the 
Supervisory Board.
The Audit Committee
During 2020 the Audit Committee was composed of Gosse Boon 
(Chairman), Paul Sheffield and Bob Elfring (per 24 August 2020). The 
composition is in line with the relevant provisions of the Code. As 
part of his induction program also the chairman of the Supervisory 
Board attended these meetings.
The Committee met four times. The external auditor was present at 
all of these meetings. The chairman of the Executive Board, the 
CFO, the Group controller and the internal audit director also 
attended all Audit Committee meetings. 
In line with its regular tasks and responsibilities, the Audit 
Committee addressed many topics, amongst which: the 
development of the key financial figures, the assurance plan 2020 
of the external auditor EY, the internal audit plan for 2021, the 
impact of new reporting standard IFRS 16 and material legal 
proceedings. In addition, the developments relating to tax, IT 
(including IT general controls), insurance, treasury, compliance, risk 
management and pensions as well as the progress on the 
transformation of the IT and finance functions were monitored and 
reviewed. 
The Audit Committee was briefed by the external auditor on 
relevant developments in the audit profession, including updated 
interpretations of the IFRS standards. The Committee met with the 
external auditor without the Executive Board being present and 
reported to the Supervisory Board on the performance of and the 
relationship with the external auditor. Furthermore, the chairman 
of the Committee regularly communicated on a one-to-one basis 
with the external auditor and the CFO. The Audit Committee 
considers the relationship with the external auditor to be effective.
Remuneration Committee
During 2020 the Remuneration Committee was composed of 
Carla Mahieu (Chairwoman), Helle Valentin, Henk Rottinghuis (per 
24 August 2020), Denise Koopmans (per 24 August 2020) and 
Harrie Noy (until 24 August 2020). The composition is in line with 
the relevant provisions of the Code.
One of the responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee is to 
make proposals to the Supervisory Board regarding the 
remuneration policy, the terms of employment of the members of 
the Executive Board and the remuneration of the members of the 
Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. The remuneration of 
members of the Executive Committee, not being member of the 
Executive Board, are also subject to the approval of the 
Supervisory Board.

the management in its endeavours to bring these items forward 
and will follow developments critically.
Composition and functioning of the Executive Board, 
Executive Committee and the Supervisory Board
Executive Board and Executive Committee
On 17 February 2020 the Company announced that Rob van 
Wingerden would not be nominated for a next term as CEO as 
the end of the strategic cycle provided a natural moment for 
Van Wingerden to transfer the helm. On 6 July we announced the 
nomination of Ruud Joosten as the new CEO and chairman of the 
Executive Board, who was appointed successively on 24 August 
(effective per 1 September). Per 31 December 2020 the Executive 
Board consisted of Ruud Joosten (CEO) and Frans den Houter 
(CFO).
Information about the individual members of the Executive Board 
is available in paragraph 5.3 of the integrated report.
Roel Vollebregt decide to pursue his career outside BAM per 3 
June 2020. He was succeeded by John Wilkinson as COO for Civil 
engineering per 5 October 2020.  Per 31 December 2020 the 
Executive Committee was composed of the following persons 
besides the members of the Executive Board: Joost Nelis as COO 
for Construction and Property, John Wilkinson as COO for Civil 
engineering, Simon Finnie as chief business excellence officer 
(CBEO) and Sven van de Wynkele as CHRO. 
Information about the individual members of the Executive 
Committee is available in paragraph 5.4 of the integrated report. 
The Supervisory Board reviewed the performance of the 
Executive Board and Executive Committee and interviewed the 
individual members of the Executive Committee and gave 
feedback to the members of the Executive Board. 
The Supervisory Board established that none of the Executive 
Board members holds more than two supervisory board positions 
at large organisations or a position as chairman of such a 
supervisory body. This is in line with the Management and 
Supervision (Public and Private Companies) Act and the Corporate 
Governance Code. No conflicts of interest between the Company 
Upon the departure of Rob van Wingerden as CEO of the 
Company, the Remuneration Committee decided on a temporary 
upgrade of the remuneration package for interim CEO Frans den 
Houter in line with the remuneration policy. Additionally, the 
Remuneration Committee reconfirmed the remuneration package 
for Ruud Joosten in line with the remuneration policy except for 
the post- employment benefits for which a policy adjustment for 
the Executive Board was confirmed by shareholders on 
24 August 2020. 
In February 2021, the Remuneration Committee submitted a 
proposal to the Supervisory Board regarding the short-term 
incentive for members of the Executive Board, based on the 2020 
performance and the applicable criteria. The Committee also 
prepared a proposal for the vesting of the long-term incentive 
plan 2018-2020. In addition, the Committee submitted a proposal 
for the objective setting for the 2021 short-term incentive and the 
2021-2023 long-term incentive.  
The Remuneration Committee prepared the remuneration report 
which also explains how the remuneration policy has been 
implemented in practice. The Committee met six times. The 
chairman of the Executive Board was present during parts of these 
meetings as were the chief human resource officer (CHRO) and 
the director compensation and benefits. The committee members 
consulted each other a number of times outside the context of a 
formal meeting. 
Nomination Committee
Until 24 August 2020 the Nomination Committee was 
composed of Harrie Noy (Chairman), Carla Mahieu and Helle 
Valentin. After that date Harrie Noy stepped down, Henk 
Rottinghuis and Denise Koopmans joined the Committee and 
Henk Rottinghuis became chairman. 
Key responsibility of the Nomination Committee is to make 
proposals to the Supervisory Board regarding the size and 
composition of the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board, 
regarding selection criteria, selection procedures, appointments 
and reappointments to both Boards as well as regarding 
assessment of their performance. The Committee also monitors 
the Executive Board’s policy on selection criteria and appointment 
procedures for senior management and holds annual appraisals 
with the individual members of the Executive Board. 
Appointments regarding the Executive Committee, not being 
Executive Board members, shall also be subject to the approval of 
the Supervisory Board.
The Nomination Committee met five times and members 
consulted each other a number of times outside the context of a 
formal meeting. Items discussed were the composition of the 
Executive Committee, the nomination of Henk Rottinghuis, 
Denise Koopmans and Bob Elfring as members of the 
Supervisory Board, the appointment of Henk Rottinghuis as

representation in supervisory boards of Dutch listed companies.
This year has seen significant change to the Executive Board and 
Executive Committee. In the appointments of a new CEO and a 
new COO, we have not been successful in introducing more 
diversity, notwithstanding the fact that we explicitly requested 
the executive search agent to pay specific attention to identifying 
and shortlisting female candidates. The fact that ultimately male 
candidates were selected has to be attributed to limited 
availability of suitable female candidates, who are also heavily 
pursued by other companies. On a positive note we would like to 
point out that we were able to attract and appoint Carla 
Rodenburg and Sofie Muyldermans as the first women managing 
directors of BAM operating companies (respectively BAM Infra 
Nederland and BAM Interbuild).
We remain committed to ensuring our internal development of 
talent into senior roles and have applied key performance 
indicators and gender ratios in our succession planning to support 
the acceleration of our plans. Clear guidance for the selection and 
assessment of senior leadership has been created, focusing on the 
mitigation of bias and mandating of diverse shortlists and 
selection panels. A specific senior leadership role for diversity and 
inclusion will support these ambitions.
Final comments
On behalf of my colleagues I can say it was highly motivating to 
see the energy and dedication all employees showed to keep BAM 
going in this difficult year. It says something about the enormous 
potential the Company has, and it strengthens our belief this 
Company can do much better.
We are grateful to all for their efforts and loyalty and invite them 
to join us on the road to new success.
Bunnik, the Netherlands, 17 February 2021
On behalf of the Supervisory Board,
Henk Rottinghuis, Chairman
and members of the Executive Board and/or Executive Committee 
were reported.
Supervisory Board
At the Annual General Meeting on 15 April 2020, Henk Rottinghuis 
was appointed as a member of the Supervisory Board and Harrie 
Noy was re-appointed for a period of another two years. On 24 
August, Denise Koopmans and Bob Elfring were appointed as 
members of the Supervisory Board and Harrie Noy handed over 
the chairmanship to Henk Rottinghuis and subsequently stepped 
down as a member of the Supervisory Board. On 31 December 
Carla Mahieu stepped down as a member of the Supervisory 
Board. We thank both for their dedication to BAM.
Information about the individual members of the Supervisory 
Board is available in paragraph 5.3 of the integrated report.
The Supervisory Board meets the requirements of the Code 
regarding independence. In 2020, the Supervisory Board 
members did not have any other relationships of a business nature 
with the Company. None of the Supervisory Board members had 
more than five memberships of supervisory boards at Dutch listed 
companies or other large institutions. The Supervisory Board is 
not aware of any conflicts of interest between the Company and 
members of the Supervisory Board.
In January 2021, we performed our annual self-assessment of the 
year 2020, which was an intense year during which 50 per cent of 
the Supervisory Board was  succeeded. The self-assessment was 
based on an extensive questionnaire that was completed by all 
members prior to the evaluation session. We concluded that the 
Board is operating well, with open discussions and constructive 
contributions from all members. This became quite evident in the 
strategic sessions with the Executive Committee. We also assessed 
the expertise of the individual members and whether the combined 
expertise is in line with the characteristics of the Company and its 
business. Several suggestions were made for further improvement. 
These relate among other things to the composition of the 
Supervisory Board, talent management and succession planning 
(especially with regard to the Executive Board), financial and 
business reporting. 
Diversity
The Supervisory Board, the Executive Board and the Executive 
Committee recognise the benefits and importance of diversity in 
their composition. Diversity is not limited to gender, but also 
includes (among other things) skills, background, experience and 
nationality. The profile for our Board includes a minimum 30 per 
cent target for female and male board members. This target 
applies mutatis mutandis to the Executive Board and the 
Executive Committee.
The present composition of the Supervisory Board is in line with 
the profile for our Board. We meet the specific target on gender 
diversity and comply with the upcoming legal quota for female

Given the positive vote of shareholders on the remuneration 
report over 2019 at the General Meeting of 15 April 2020, the 
structure of the remuneration report for this year has not changed.
Remuneration policy for the Executive Board
The Supervisory Board draws up the remuneration policy for the 
Executive Board based on advice from its Remuneration 
Committee. The General Meeting adopts the remuneration policy. 
Once the remuneration policy has been adopted, the Supervisory 
Board determines the remuneration for the individual members of 
the Executive Board, again based on recommendations of its 
Remuneration Committee. 
The Supervisory Board will regularly review the remuneration 
package to ensure that it complies with the assumptions underlying 
the remuneration policy. The policy will also be evaluated regularly 
and be put forward for adoption at the General Meeting at least 
every four years. The current remuneration policy was adopted by 
the General Meeting on 15 April 2020 and somewhat adjusted with 
its approval on 24 August 2020 (as described under ‘Post-
employment benefits and other benefits’).
Design principles
The remuneration policy is geared to attract and retain highly qualified 
executives, including from other industries, and motivate them to 
achieve Royal BAM Group’s objectives. Particular emphasis is placed on 
experience with the Company’s (international) activities and the 
necessary management qualities. The policy also aims to stimulate 
profitable growth and long-term value creation. It is transparently 
communicated and safeguards fairness and consistency within BAM 
and externally. Variable remuneration is an important part of the total 
package. The policy supports both short- and long-term objectives, 
whereas the emphasis is on long-term value creation for Royal BAM 
Group and its stakeholders. It contributes to this long-term value 
creation by not only focusing on financial targets but also on 
non-financial targets such as sustainability. 
In designing the policy and to determine the remuneration of the 
Executive Board, the Remuneration Committee uses external 
benchmark information to assess market comparability. Remuneration 
levels for total direct compensation (fixed remuneration plus 
short-term incentive plus long-term incentive) are aimed at the median 
of a labour market reference group. In addition, the internal pay 
differentials (fairness and differences towards the rest of the 
organisation) are monitored. Scenario analyses are used to determine 
possible outcomes of the variable remuneration elements, including 
the maximum value of the long-term incentive. The remuneration 
structure and elements consider that risk-taking beyond the risk profile 
of the Company should not be encouraged. The Remuneration 
Committee has taken note of the Executive Board members’ view on 
their remuneration. 
Labour market reference group
The labour market reference group as shown in  table 36 is based 
on industry, ownership structure, geographical business scope and 
size parameters.

Fixed remuneration
The Supervisory Board determines the fixed remuneration of the 
individual members of the Executive Board based on advice of the 
Remuneration Committee. Once a year, the Supervisory Board 
evaluates whether and, if so, to what extent the fixed remuneration 
will be adjusted. This annual evaluation generally takes place per      
1 January of each year and considers personal performance, the 
results of the past year, the extent to which the current fixed 
remuneration deviates from the benchmark and general changes in 
the market.
Short-term incentive (STI)
The STI depends on the realisation of predetermined measurable 
objectives. 70 per cent of the STI is based on financial objectives and 
30 per cent is linked to non-financial objectives which are relevant 
for the Company’s (long-term) success. Within this framework, each 
of the financial objectives is given a certain weight and for each of 
these objectives performance incentive zones are defined. 
The non-financial objectives are evaluated together and do not have 
individual weights or performance incentive zones. Pay-out 
gradually increases with performance, starting with a pay-out of 
35 per cent of the fixed annual remuneration at threshold 
performance, 55 per cent at target performance and potentially 
going up to 75 per cent when performance is excellent. Below 
threshold there will be zero pay-out.

To ensure continued alignment of the STI with BAM’s strategy and to 
enable adequate responses to the challenges the Company faces, 
flexibility with respect to the STI objectives is important. Therefore, 
at the beginning of each financial year, based upon a proposal from 
the Remuneration Committee, the Supervisory Board determines 
the financial and non-financial STI objectives as well as the relative 
weighting and the performance incentive zones (threshold, at target 
and excellent performance levels) for the financial objectives. 
After the end of the financial year, the Remuneration Committee 
determines to what extent the STI targets for the selected 
objectives have been met. The Supervisory Board, following a 
proposal from the Remuneration Committee, will decide upon the 
STI to be awarded over the past financial year. Specific attention is 
given to the non-financial objectives to evaluate in detail what has 
concretely and measurably been delivered.
The financial objectives and weighting are disclosed at the 
beginning of the financial year. After the end of the financial year 
the Supervisory Board will disclose the performance on each of the 
objectives as a percentage of target performance. 
The performance incentive zones (threshold, at target and excellent 
performance levels) qualify as commercially sensitive information 
and will not be disclosed.

combined result of the number of performance shares that will vest 
and the share price at the moment of vesting – that will become 
unconditional to a participant will at vesting never exceed two and 
a half times the award value in order to avoid inappropriate 
pay-outs.
In accordance with the Code the three-year vesting period will be 
followed by a two-year lock-up period. In addition, there is a 
minimum share ownership requirement, which amounts to 100 
per cent of fixed remuneration for the CEO and to 75 per cent of 
fixed remuneration for other members of the Executive Board. 
The members are not allowed to divest any shareholding until the 
two-year lock-up period has lapsed and the minimum share 
ownership requirements are met, with the exception of any sale of 
shares during the lock-up period required to meet any tax 
obligations and social security premiums (including any other 
duties and levies) as a consequence of the vesting.
The authority to implement the long-term incentive plan for the 
Executive Board lies with the Supervisory Board, which has the right 
to change or terminate the scheme at any time. If the Supervisory 
Board decides to terminate or make material changes to the 
long-term incentive plan for Executive Board members, the General 
Meeting will be asked to adopt a resolution to that effect. 
Upon a decision of the Supervisory Board, following a proposal 
from the Remuneration Committee, the Company has the 
discretionary power to fully or partially reclaim from the participant 
who is a member of the Executive Board the conditionally awarded 
performance shares as well as vested shares (or any benefit 
resulting therefrom) where those have been awarded on the basis 
of incorrect information concerning:
• The ac
hievement of the performance objectives concerned; or
•  Eve
nts or conditions on which the shares were conditionally 
awarded.
At the discretionary request of the Supervisory Board, the 
Company’s independent auditor will check the calculations carried 
out and conclusions reached in connection with the long-term 
incentive plan, in which case the independent auditor’s 
assessment will be binding. 
In drafting the remuneration policy, the Supervisory Board has 
taken into consideration the mix between fixed remuneration and 
variable remuneration in various scenarios. See  tables 39 and 40. 
The maximum relative value of the variable remuneration 
elements, considering an unchanging share price, is between 62 
per cent and 64 per cent of the total, with the higher value being 
awarded through the long-term incentive plan. This incentivises 
achievement and (long-term) value creation while at the same 
time guarding against inappropriate outcomes.
Post-employment benefits and other benefits
As approved by the Extraordinary General Meeting of 24 August 
2020, Executive Board members receive an age-independent gross 
In cases in which the variable remuneration is awarded on the basis 
of inaccurate (financial) data, the Supervisory Board has the right to 
adjust the STI accordingly, and BAM is entitled to reclaim (any part 
of) the STI paid to a member of the Executive Board on the basis of 
incorrect (financial) information.
Long-term incentive (LTI)
Executive Board members participate in a performance share plan. 
Each year, performance shares are conditionally awarded. These 
shares vest after a vesting period of three years subject to the 
relevant performance over this period. The number of annually 
awarded performance shares is calculated by dividing the award 
value by the average closing price of the BAM share on Euronext 
Amsterdam on the five days after the General Meeting in the year of 
award. The award value is 70 per cent of fixed remuneration for the 
CEO and 60 per cent of fixed remuneration for the CFO. The 
Supervisory Board has concluded that these percentages are no 
longer in line with the labour market reference group but will 
consider to propose changes only per 2022 in light of current 
circumstances.
Performance is based on two financial objectives, being relative total 
shareholder return (TSR) and return on capital employed (ROCE) and 
one non-financial objective, being sustainability. 
TSR  is defined as the share price increase, including dividends and 
measured over a three-year period based on the three-month 
average share price before the start and the end of the three-year 
performance period. The relative position within the peer group 
determines the vesting percentage. The composition of the TSR peer 
group is evaluated on a periodic basis, among other things, 
considering corporate events. As of the 2018-2020 LTI plan, the TSR 
peer group comprises of Balfour Beatty, Boskalis, Eiffage, Heijmans, 
Hochtief, NCC, PORR, Skanska, Strabag, Vinci (and BAM). 
At the beginning of each financial year, based upon a proposal from 
the Remuneration Committee, the Supervisory Board determines 
the performance incentive zones (threshold, at target and excellent 
performance levels) for ROCE and sustainability. After the three-
year performance period, the Supervisory Board, based on a 
proposal by the Remuneration Committee, will assess the extent to 
which the performance objectives have been achieved. This results 
in a vesting percentage for each of the three performance 
objectives, each determining one third of the vesting of the 
conditionally awarded performance shares. For excellent 
performance, the number of performance shares that vests may 
amount to a maximum of 150 per cent of the ‘at target’ number of 
performance shares. This percentage may be reduced to 50 per 
cent (on a sliding scale) for threshold performance and to zero 
below that. The performance incentive zones are presented in 
 table 38. The TSR objective will also operate as a ‘circuit breaker’ 
for the vesting linked to the other two performance objectives: in 
case BAM ranks at the bottom two places of the TSR peer group, 
the other two objectives will not result in vesting regardless of the 
performance. The value of the performance shares – as the

Derogation clause
A derogation clause is included in the remuneration policy to 
safeguard that the Supervisory Board can use its discretion to 
ensure that the short-term and long-term incentive plans continue 
to support the interests of the Company even in exceptional 
circumstances and retains the option to intervene when required. 
In exceptional circumstances the Supervisory Board may decide to 
temporarily deviate from the remuneration policy of the Executive 
Board based on a proposal of its Remuneration Committee, when 
this is necessary to serve the long-term interests and sustainability 
of the Company as a whole or to assure its viability. The derogations 
can concern the objective setting and pay-out of the short-term 
and long-term incentive plans. 
Remuneration Executive Board in 2020
The members of the Executive Board received remuneration in the 
past financial year in line with the remuneration policy adopted by 
the General Meeting on 15 April 2020 and 24 August 2020.
Covid-19
The Executive Board and the Executive Committee voluntarily chose 
to apply a 20 per cent pay reduction for the months April until 
September 2020 to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on BAM. This 
resulted in a 20 per cent reduction of fixed remuneration for Mr Den 
Houter (April up until and including September) and Mr Joosten 
(September). The unchanged fixed remuneration remained the basis 
for the calculation of other terms and conditions. In addition, it was 
decided to postpone the 2019 STI payment to Mr Den Houter until 
September 2020. The pay reduction ended per 1 October 2020 since 
construction sites had become fully operational again. 
Fixed remuneration
The fixed remuneration of Mr Joosten is set at the CEO policy level 
of €700,000 gross per annum. The fixed remuneration of 
allowance of 22 per cent of their fixed remuneration from which 
they need to finance their own retirement savings, including a 
surviving dependent’s pension. 
Given his long-term employment with the Company, Mr Van 
Wingerden participated until the end date of the management 
services agreement, 1 June 2020, in the Company’s Dutch pension 
schemes for regular employees: the pension scheme for the 
construction industry, a supplementary defined contribution 
pension scheme and an uncapped annual gross compensation 
which can be used to participate in a net pension scheme or to 
make own retirement savings. The pension schemes include a 
surviving dependent’s pension.
As for employees, BAM has a competitive benefits package for the 
members of the Executive Board. This package includes such 
matters as healthcare and disability insurance, personal accident 
insurance, a car scheme and reimbursement of business expenses. 
The Company does not offer loans, warrants and the like to 
members of the Executive Board or to employees, except for the 
following indemnities and insurances.
Current and former members of the Supervisory Board and 
Executive Board are covered by the indemnity, under the Articles 
of Association, against claims made against them in respect of 
actions or omissions in the performance of the duties of their 
position, unless said actions or omissions constituted wilful, 
deliberately reckless or seriously culpable misconduct and/or 
consisted of traffic offences. This facility also applies to all 
employees and former employees of BAM. The Company has 
taken out directors’ and officers’ liability insurance under standard 
market terms and conditions for the members of the Supervisory 
Board, Executive Board and Executive Committee, as well as for 
the management team members of operating companies and all 
other directors and officers within BAM.

Mr Den Houter was increased to €500,000 gross per annum as 
of 1 January 2020, considering personal performance and 
developments in the labour market reference group.
Mr Den Houter served as CEO on an interim basis until the 
appointment of Mr Joosten, safeguarding continuity of leadership 
and ensuring that Mr Joosten could quickly come up to speed in 
his new role. Mr Den Houter therefore received a temporary CEO 
allowance of €200,000 gross per annum from mid-February  2020 
until 30 November 2020, which was also included in the basis for 
calculation of the STI over 2020. Additionally, the LTI award value 
for the 2020-2022 plan was based on an award value of 70 per 
cent (CEO level instead of CFO level) of fixed remuneration 
including the CEO allowance.
Short-term incentive
Based on input from the Remuneration Committee, the Supervisory 
Board evaluated the performance of the Executive Board in 2020 in 
relation to the objectives that had been set for the year. The 
financial objectives that had been selected were: adjusted result 
before tax (weight 45 per cent), trade working capital (weight 
15 per cent) and business cash flow (weight 10 per cent). The 
non-financial objectives (weight 30 per cent) were related to the 
implementation of the One BAM strategy, the Uniform Project 
Approach (UPA) and the enhancement of the overall performance 
culture. These criteria have all been made concrete and measurable 
for this purpose. Additionally it was agreed at the beginning of the 
year that the Supervisory Board would take into account the 
specific circumstances caused by the Covid-19 crisis.
The evaluation of the performance of the Executive Board in 
relation to the objectives resulted in an incentive of 32.3 per cent of 
the 2020 fixed remuneration. Concerning the achievement on the 
non-financial objectives the Supervisory Board concluded that the 
performance was between threshold and target level. That being 
said, but without changing this assessment, it was concluded that 
the Executive Board handled the Covid-19 crisis very well, resulting 
in a relatively small number of employees being infected and 
building sites staying open where possible. The Executive Board 
also demonstrated exceptional agility in dealing with the difficult 
situation within BAM during 2020; quickly taking stock and 
adjusting course where needed. Overall the Supervisory Board 
appreciates this very highly. More details can be found in  table 43. 
Long-term incentive
The remuneration policy for Executive Board members includes a 
long-term incentive plan under which Executive Board members 
receive an annual award of conditional performance shares vesting 
after three years, depending on Company performance as defined in 
the remuneration policy. The conditionally awarded and vested 
performance shares are stated in  table 46. 
The conditional performance shares that were awarded under the 
performance share plan 2017-2019 vested on 27 April 2020. The 
vesting percentage of the shares was determined at zero per cent. 
The reason for this was that Royal BAM Group ranked 10th in the TSR 
peer group, which functions as a circuit breaker nullifying the 
performance on the other objectives (ROCE and sustainability). More 
details can be found in  table 43.
Mr Van Wingerden was not nominated for a next term as CEO on the 
General Meeting of 15 April 2020, the management services 
agreement ended per 1 June 2020. In line with the plan rules, the 
performance share awards of Mr Van Wingerden for the periods 
2018-2020 and 2019-2021 have been decreased pro rata the number 
of months not providing management services during the relevant 
performance periods. The remaining shares will vest against the 
vesting percentage determined by the Supervisory Board at the 
applicable vesting dates. The lock-up period and minimum share 
ownership requirements for the vested performance shares ended 
per 1 June 2020. In line with the Company’s insider dealing policy, 
Mr Van Wingerden was not allowed to sell the vested performance 
shares during closed periods up until 1 December 2020.

not been in line with market practice. Mr Van Wingerden participated 
until 1 June 2020 in the Company’s Dutch pension schemes for regular 
employees. In line with the remuneration policy and management 
services agreement, Mr Van Wingerden received a severance payment 
of one year’s fixed remuneration.
Remuneration overview
A summary of the remuneration of the individual members of the 
Executive Board can be found in  table 42.
BAM has not awarded any options to members of the Executive 
Board, members of management teams of operating companies or 
employees. The remuneration of the Executive Board members was 
not affected by a change of control at the Company. No loans were 
issued to them. 
The Supervisory Board did not see any reason during the financial 
year to use its extraordinary powers to adjust or reclaim variable or 
long-term remuneration that was awarded previously.
BAM has no other remuneration provisions, beyond the 
remuneration package mentioned in the remuneration report, nor 
are there any other rights to one-time payments.
Internal pay ratio in 2020
The Dutch Corporate Governance Code (2016) states that the 
remuneration policy should consider the internal pay ratio within 
the organisation and that this pay ratio should be reported in the 
remuneration report. Additionally, the revised Shareholders’ Rights 
Directive, as implemented into Dutch Law, requires the Company 
to perform a five-year analysis of Board remuneration versus 
average employee remuneration and Company performance.
For these purposes BAM applies a methodology based on the 
employee benefits according to the financial statements and the 
Executive Board remuneration according to  table 42 of this report. 
BAM’s internal pay ratio is calculated as the total annual CEO 
remuneration divided by the average employee remuneration 
(employee benefit expenses excluding restructuring costs and 
termination benefits divided by the average number of FTE). 
Consequently, BAM’s calculated internal pay ratio in 2020 was  
14 (2019: 17), implying that the CEO pay was 14 times the 
ave
rage pay within the organisation. The decrease of the ratio is 
explained through the fact that the LTI award for 2017-2019 did 
not vest and the voluntary 20 per cent pay reduction for the 
months April until September 2020.
The required five-year analysis of Board remuneration versus 
average employee remuneration and Company performance can 
be found in  table 45. It reflects the same definitions for 
Executive Board and average employee remuneration. 
Additionally, it contains the performance measure adjusted result 
before tax which we believe is a crucial reflection of the success 
of the Company.
Terms of appointment of the Executive Board 
members
Members of the Executive Board are appointed for a term of four 
years and deliver their services under a management services 
agreement. The notice period for these members can be found in   
 table 44. If the Company terminates the management services 
agreement of a member of the Executive Board, the maximum 
severance payment will be one year’s fixed remuneration.
Securities rules
The Company has rules relating to the possession of and trading in 
BAM securities. These rules are published on the Company’s 
website. BAM also has regulations for members of the Executive 
Board and the Supervisory Board relating to the trading in securities 
other than those issued by the Company.
Share ownership of the Executive Board members    
Per 31 December 2020, Mr Joosten held 0 BAM shares and 
Mr Den Houter held 25,000 privately acquired BAM shares. 
Remuneration of the Executive Board in 2021
At the beginning of the financial year, the Supervisory Board 
discloses the specific financial objectives and relevant 
weighting for the short-term incentive. For 2021 the financial 
objectives and weighting for the short-term incentive are: 
Adjusted EBITDA (weight 45 per cent) and trade working capital 
(weight 25 per cent). The selected STI targets support the 
company objectives since they are fully aligned with its 
strategy of significantly improving profitability while ensuring a 
healthy cash generation. 
Additionally, the Supervisory Board discloses the specific criteria 
that underly the sustainability objective of the long-term incentive 
plan at the start of the performance period. As in previous years 
the performance share plan 2021-2023 contains three 
sustainability criteria of equal weight, being: BAM’s ranking on 
CDP’s climate change A list, carbon intensity reduction and 
construction and office waste intensity reduction. 
Remuneration policy for the Supervisory Board
The remuneration policy for the Supervisory Board as stated 
below was adopted by the General Meeting on 15 April 2020. 
The Supervisory Board draws up the Supervisory Board 
remuneration policy based on advice from its Remuneration 
Committee.

put forward for adoption at the General Meeting at least every 
four years in line with the Shareholders’ Rights Directive.

when a Supervisory Board member is temporarily delegated to 
support the Executive Committee in an advisory role.
Given the nature of the responsibilities of the Supervisory Board 
the remuneration is not tied to BAM’s results, nor impacted by 
any change of control at the Company. As a policy BAM does not 
award any options or shares to members of the Supervisory 
Board. If and in so far as a Supervisory Board member holds 
shares in the Company, these should be long-term investments. 
No loans are issued to members of the Supervisory Board nor are 
they eligible to participate in any benefits programme offered by 
BAM to its employees.
No additional remuneration, such as sign-on bonuses, is paid upon 
recruiting new Supervisory Board members. The Supervisory 
Board members are not eligible to any severance, claw-back or 
change of control provisions. 
Share ownership of the Supervisory Board members    
Per 31 December 2020 Mr Boon held 80,000 privately acquired BAM 
shares and Mrs Valentin held 30,000 privately acquired BAM shares. 
Remuneration of the Supervisory Board in 2020
Covid-19
In line with the decision of the Executive Board and the Executive 
Committee to apply a 20 per cent pay reduction for the months 
April up until and including September 2020 to mitigate the 
impact of Covid-19 on BAM, the Supervisory Board also voluntarily 
applied a 20 per cent reduction to its fixed remuneration and 
committee fees. Additionally, it was decided to not apply the 
intended increase of the fixed remuneration for the Chairman 
from €70,000 to €90,000 gross per annum (as approved by the 
General Meeting on 15 April 2020) until 1 October 2020.
Besides this, the members of the Supervisory Board received 
remuneration in the past financial year in line with the 
remuneration policy as adopted by the General Meeting on 
15 April 2020. 
From mid-February up until 1 November 2020 Mr Sheffield acted 
as delegated Supervisory Board member to support the Executive 
Committee in an advisory role. In line with the remuneration 
policy, Mr Sheffield received an additional remuneration of 
€1,500 per half-day for these activities, he spent 35.5 days on this.
No options or shares were awarded to members of the 
Supervisory Board and no loans were issued to them.
Bunnik, the Netherlands, 17 February 2021 
Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board remuneration policy is geared to attract 
and retain members that contribute to the desired composition 
regarding expertise, experience, diversity and independence, as 
set out in the profile of the Supervisory Board. The policy aims to 
reward Supervisory Board members for time spent and the 
responsibilities of their role, including but not limited to the 
responsibilities imposed by the Civil Code, Dutch Corporate 
Governance Code and the Articles of Association. On this basis, 
the remuneration for Supervisory Board members consists of the 
following elements: 
• A fix
ed remuneration and a fixed committee fee (regardless of 
the number of committees in which the member participates), 
which varies for the chairman, vice-chairman and members, to 
reflect the time spent and the responsibilities of the role;
• An at
tendance fee per meeting for non-Dutch members to 
compensate these members for additional time spent to attend 
meetings;
• A rei
mbursement of actual costs in the performance of the 
duties for BAM.
Committee impact and responsibility is deemed to be 
comparable. Hence BAM does not differentiate in committee fees. 
The amounts can be found in  table 41.
  41 - Remuneration
Fixed remuneration Chairman €90,000 per annum
Vice-chairman €55,000 per annum
Member €50,000  
Committee fee Chairman €10,000 per annum
Member €7,000 per annum
Attendance fee for 
non-Dutch residents
€1,500 per meeting
Expenses Reimbursement of actual 
incurred costs
The Supervisory Board uses external benchmark information to 
assess market comparability of the remuneration. Remuneration 
levels are aimed at the median of Dutch listed companies with a 
two-tier board structure comparable in size and scope. 
In exceptional circumstances, when a significant increase in time 
investment by its members is necessary to serve the long-term 
interests and sustainability of the Company as a whole or to assure its 
viability, the Supervisory Board may decide to temporarily deviate 
from the remuneration policy of the Supervisory Board based on a 
proposal of its Remuneration Committee. In such circumstances the 
Supervisory Board may decide to award members an additional 
remuneration of €1,500 per half-day. This can, for example, occur

¹ The amount shown under Long-term incentive consists of the phantom share plans and performance share plans that form taxable income for the Executive

² The a
mount shown under Other benefits consists of the additional tax liability for private use of the company car, since the value of this benefit can be

¹  The actual remuneration for the CEO in 2020 is based on the annualised remuneration of Mr Joosten, who was appointed per September 2020. The actual 
re
muneration for the CFO in 2020 is excluding the CEO allowance, the retrospective payment in 2020 of pension contribution as of 1 August 2018 to the CFO 
has been allocated to the relevant years. The actual remuneration for the CFO in 2018 has been annualised since Mr Den Houter was appointed per August 
2018. No LTI was included, since nothing vested that year. 
2 As from 2018 the adjusted result before tax has been impacted by the implementation of IFRS15.
3 The amounts are excluding (fixed) expense allowance. Amounts 2020 include the 20 per cent Covid-19 reduction and the additional remuneration for  
Mr
 Sheffield as delegated Supervisory Board member.

¹  This is the ’at target’ number of conditionally awarded performance shares. For Mr Joosten, the awarded shares in 2020 have been decreased pro rata the number of 
mo
nths providing management services during the relevant performance period. Since Mr Den Houter served as CEO on an interim basis until the appointment of 
Ruud Joosten, the LTI award value for the 2020-2022 plan was based on an award value of 70 per cent (CEO level instead of CFO level) of fixed remuneration including 
the CEO allowance. For Mr Van Wingerden, the awarded shares in 2018 and 2019 have been decreased pro rata the number of months not providing management 
services during the relevant performance periods. The number of performance shares that vests may vary between 0 (in case of performance below threshold) and 
150 per cent (in case of performance at or above excellent) of the ‘at target’ number of performance shares.
² The n
umber of vested shares at vesting date before tax and including dividend up until vesting date.
³  No lo
ck-up period applies for Mr Van Wingerden since he has left the Company per 1 June 2020.
4   The value for the awards in 2015 and 2016 is based on the actual number of vested shares on the vesting date before tax. The value for the awards in 2018, 2019 and 
20
20 is based on the ‘Number of conditionally awarded shares’ in this table (since the vesting percentage is not yet known at year-end 2020) multiplied by the closing 
share price of BAM at year-end 2020 (€1.705). For Mr Van Wingerden the value of the award for 2015 is based on the opening share price of BAM at the day of vesting.
5   Since BAM ranks 11th of the TSR peer group for this performance share plan the circuit breaker is applicable. Therefore, the Supervisory Board has decided on  
17 F
ebruary 2021 that the conditional shares will be forfeited at the vesting date of this plan (26 April 2021).

In 2020, the Company contributed the know-how, expertise and investments in the field of asphalt production in a newly formed joint venture, AsfaltNu cv 
(see note 5). As a result, the Company derecognized the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests in the former subsidiaries contributed to the 
newly formed joint venture for an amount of approximately €3 million.
In 2020, the Company acquired all shares from a minority shareholder in an asphalt production company for the amount of approximately €5 million, 
increasing its interest to 100 per cent. Since this is an transaction with a minority shareholder, the amount is recognised through equity and reflected as 
other movements in the table above. See consolidated statement of cash flows ‘other financing activities’.

Royal BAM Group nv87Integrated Report 2020
1. General information
Royal BAM Group nv (‘the Company’ or ‘BAM’), its subsidiaries (together, ‘the Group’) and the Group’s participations in joint operations and 
investments in associates and joint ventures offers its clients a substantial package of products and services in the sectors Construction and 
property, Civil engineering and Public Private Partnerships (‘PPP’). The Group is mainly active in the Netherlands, Belgium, the United 
Kingdom, Ireland and Germany. The Group is also involved in specialist construction and civil engineering projects in niche markets worldwide.
The Company is a public limited company, which is listed on Euronext Amsterdam, with its registered seat and head office in Bunnik, 
the Ne
therlands.
On 17 February 2021, the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board authorised the financial statements for issue. The financial statements as 
presented in this report are subject to the adoption by the Annual General Meeting on 14 April 2021.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.  
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
2.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union and also comply with the financial reporting requirements included in Part 9 of Book 2 of the 
Dutch Civil Code, as far as applicable.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, unless otherwise stated.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense, including the current market and Covid-19 conditions. 
The basis for these estimates remain unchanged compared to those described in the 2019 financial statements (with the exception of 
the change in judgment as per 30 June 2020 regarding the subordinated loans (and commitments thereto) of BAM PPP as explained in 
note 37), provided that the estimation uncertainty is inherently increased due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
This has especially effect on the estimates made regarding the valuation of goodwill, deferred tax assets, projects, land and building 
rights and property development and the going concern assumption (including expected compliance with financial covenants). Actual 
results may differ from these estimates. The other significant judgements made by management remained the same as those that were 
applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019. Further information and considerations with 
regard to areas of significant judgments and estimates have been disclosed below and in note 4.
2.1.1 Partnership extension BAM and PGGM
In 2011, BAM formed via BAM PPP Concessies bv (BAM PPP) a joint venture with PGGM, BAM PPP PGGM Infrastructure Coöperatie ua, to 
jointly target PPP project opportunities in BAM’s home markets. In 2020, BAM decided to extend the partnership between BAM PPP and 
PGGM with the aim to continue their strong track record and explore opportunities to extend their partnership outside BAM’s European 
home markets to benefit from growth in the global PPP market. A first step in the partnership extension was effected in June 2020 when 
BAM transferred its share in 21 projects that are currently within the BAM PPP-PGGM joint venture (from 20 per cent to 10 per cent). This 
provides BAM with the opportunity to realise value from the current BAM PPP investment portfolio. See note 17 and 37.3.
As a second step, on 23 December 2020, BAM has transferred 50 per cent of the shares of BAM PPP to PGGM. BAM PPP was
previously fully owned by BAM and fully incorporated in the consolidated financial statement. Due to the loss of control of BAM PPP, all 
the assets and liabilities of the former subsidiary BAM PPP are derecognised from the consolidated statement of financial position as per 
31 December 2020. The retained interest of 50 per cent in BAM PPP, which is qualified as a joint venture from BAM’s perspective, has 
been recognised at its fair value as per 31 December 2020. See note 11.2.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements

Page 88:
88Integrated Report 2020 Royal BAM Group nv
As BAM PPP was reported as a separate operating segment and therefore a major business line, the results of BAM PPP are reported as 
discontinued operations in the consolidated income statement. In the consolidated income statement for 2020 and 2019, the results of 
these discontinued operations have been presented on a separate line ‘Result for the year from discontinued operations’. The 2019 
consolidated income statements has been adjusted for comparative purposes. The gain on the transfer of the shares to PGGM and on 
remeasurement of the retained interest forms part of this result. See note 37 for further details.
2.1.2 Assessment on Covid-19
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organisation officially declared Covid-19, the disease caused by novel coronavirus, a global 
pandemic. Covid-19, as well as the measures introduced to slow the spread of the virus, have since had a significant impact on the global 
economy and the markets the Group operates in. 
The Group was highly affected by the pandemic mainly in the first half of the year as our operational performance was reduced. 
Therefore, BAM’s financial performance in the first half of the year was considerably impacted by these extraordinary circumstances. 
However, in the further course of 2020 the operational performance improved significantly to nearly pre Covid-19 levels. In response to 
the pandemic the Company rigorously cut non-essential capital expenditures, reduced company costs and cash positions show a positive 
trend (including withdrawal of the revolving credit facility of €400 million). The positive trend reflects governmental support schemes, 
mainly VAT, as well as careful cash management while fully respecting payment term commitments to the supply chain. Although, our 
operational performance recovered nearly fully, and the impact on our supply chains  and customers seem currently limited, the 
company continues to closely monitor the developments of this pandemic and to assess risks for its financial results, positions and cash 
flows and implementing appropriate actions promptly when deemed necessary. 
Category Assessment Notes
Liquidity and risk management The Group has identified a broad range of mitigating actions to preserve liquidity. 
These measures include, among others, cost and capex reductions for nonessential 
expenditures, governmental furlough schemes, rigid  focus on working capital 
management and governmental measures to delay tax payments on VAT and wages 
for a total amount of €234 million. Also the revolving credit facility for an amount of 
€400 million was fully drawn in 2020 as a precautionary measure. See 2.1.3.
15, 25
Goodwill Deteriorating market conditions (including Covid-19) resulted in the Company 
performing a goodwill impairment test in the first half year of 2020. The key 
assumptions of the goodwill impairment tests included revenue growth rates, profit 
before tax and the discount rates used for discounting the expected cash flows. All 
key assumptions were updated to reflect the Company’s best estimates. The outcome 
of this test revealed an impairment of €60 million, which has been recognised in the 
profit or loss as per 30 June 2020. The Company also prepared an impairment test at 
year end with updated key assumptions to reflect the current situation. The outcome 
of this goodwill impairment test did not result in any further impairment of goodwill.
9, 28
Other non-financial assets Other non-financial assets comprising of property plant and equipment, intangible 
assets (excluding goodwill) and right-of-use assets, have been assessed for indicators 
of impairment. The Company has not identified any impairment indicators as a result   
of Covid-19.
7, 8, 9
Inventories The Company has prepared an assessment in 2020 which revealed an impairment of 
€13 million related to certain property developments and land/buildings. The 
Company has not further identified a material change to the write-down of 
inventories to net realizable value, compared to 2019 in respect of Covid-19. 
13, 28
Trade and other receivables The Company has assessed the impact of Covid-19 on any expected credit losses 
related to trade and other receivables. The Company did not identify a material 
increase in the expected credit losses as a result of Covid-19.

Financial covenants Considering the waiver, which was obtained for 30 June 2020 from its revolving credit 
facility lenders on 7 August 2020, BAM complies with all financial covenant 
requirements as per 31 December 2020. The Group has further assessed the impact 
of Covid-19 on its current and forecast performance against its financial covenant 
metrics. The Group performed a sensitivity analysis on the covenant requirements for 
the next 12 months all with satisfactory outcome. See 2.1.3.
19
Pensions Covid-19 could have affected interest rates and investment performance. The 
Company performed an analysis to identify any impact of Covid-19 on the valuation of 
the net defined benefit liability. The outcome of this analysis did not result in a 
material impact on the valuation of the net defined benefit liability.
22
Deferred Tax Assets The Group has considered the impact of Covid-19 in the estimates used for the 
valuation of the deferred tax assets. In 2020, the reduced expected forecasted results  
led to re-measurement of the recognized deferred tax assets related to tax losses 
carried forward in the Netherlands and Germany.
24
Government grants In 2020, the Group made use of the temporary deferral of tax payment (value added 
tax and wage tax) granted by certain tax authorities which totally amount to 
approximately €234 million. Certain governmental (furlough) schemes were used in 
connection with Covid-19 for a total amount of approximately €12 million, which is 
fully reflected in wages and salaries. An amount of €10 million in respect of the 
United Kingdom (€8 million) and Ireland (€2 million) has been received and is 
deducted from wages and salaries. The remainder of  €2 million is reflected as a 
reduction of the wages and salaries as part of the employee benefit expenses, given 
the fact that grants in Belgium were directly paid to employees. See note 41.
25, 26, 41
2.1.3 Assessment on going concern assumption 
In 2020, BAM was faced with extraordinary circumstances caused by Covid-19 that amongst other led to BAM’s precautionary measure to 
fully draw the revolving credit facility for €400 million. In addition, BAM’s performance was affected by continued losses at BAM 
International, the Cologne metro settlement (Waidmarkt) and to a lesser extent by the underperformance of the German construction 
and Dutch civil engineering business. These developments resulted in higher interest costs and impacted BAM’s operational 
performance, which gave rise to the fact that the recourse leverage ratio and the recourse interest cover ratio were below the threshold 
as per 30 June 2020. As a consequence, the Group requested and obtained a waiver. See note 19.
 
Although BAM’s financial performance recovered in the further course of 2020, given aforementioned developments, BAM made a 
detailed assessment of the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The going concern assessment takes amongst others the 
operating plan 2021 (not expecting any further closings of sites due to Covid-19), developments of BAM’s orderbook, compliance with all 
financial covenants requirements, cash projections and/or the ability to fulfil the short term liabilities towards the supply chain into 
account. In performing this assessment, BAM considered factors that could indicate the presence of material uncertainties that might 
cast significant doubt upon the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Factors considered included: operating results and/or 
major losses on projects, the maturity of the convertible bonds in 2021, potential further restrictions on Covid-19, uncertainties 
regarding Brexit and a potential economic downturn. BAM responded decisively and promptly by taking measures to ensure business 
continuity, significantly reduce cost and capital expenditure to protect liquidity and profitability. Liquidity, also supported by 
governmental schemes on payment holiday on VAT- and wage taxes (amounting to €234 million) and the fully drawn revolving credit 
facility of €400 million, is around €1.8 billion at 31 December 2020 (see note 15). Based on the current cash-flow projections and the 
extent to which the cash is available for free disposal, this is sufficient to cover cash requirements in the upcoming year (up to and 
including February 2022). 
BAM has ‘stress tested’ its going concern assessment, taking into account abovementioned factors on an individual basis, and considered 
all available information about the future such as result forecasts and cash flow projections, at least twelve months after the date of 
these financial statements (up to and including February 2022). The Company performed sensitivity analyses on the financial covenant 
requirements, all with satisfactory outcome as its outcome demonstrates sufficient headroom for all of its covenant requirements.
BAM in its judgement concluded that given the outcome of the going concern assessment and sensitivity analyses performed, it is 
appropriate to prepare the financial statements on the basis of going concern and despite the factors and uncertainties described above, 
there are no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the year 
subsequent to the date of these financial statements. Given the continuing uncertainty related to the impact of Covid-19, BAM closely 
monitors the developments regarding Covid-19 and analyses risks for its financial results, position and cash flows and implementing 
further mitigating actions when deemed necessary.

2.1.4 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures
(a) Application of new and revised standards
The group applied for the first-time certain standards and amendments, which are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2020. The Group has not yet early adopted any other standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not 
yet effective.
Amendment to IFRS 3, ‘Business combinations – Definition of a business’
The narrow-scope amendments clarify how to determine whether an acquired set of activities and assets is a business or not.  
The amendments clarify the minimum requirements for a business; remove the assessment of whether market participants are  
capable of replacing any missing elements; add guidance to help entities assess whether an acquired process is substantive; narrow  
the definitions of a business and of outputs; and introduce an optional fair value concentration test. This amendment did not have a 
material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
Amendments to IFRS 7 and IFRS 9 ‘Interest Rate Benchmark Reform’
The amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement provide a number of reliefs, which apply to all hedging 
relationships that are directly affected by interest rate benchmark reform. A hedging relationship is affected if the reform gives rise to 
uncertainty about the timing and/or amount of benchmark-based cash flows of the hedged item or the hedging instrument. These 
amendments have no material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 ‘Definition of Material’
The amendments provide a new definition of material that states, “information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could 
reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those 
financial statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting entity.” The amendments clarify that materiality will 
depend on the nature or magnitude of information, either individually or in combination with other information, in the context of the 
financial statements. A misstatement of information is material if it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions made by the 
primary users. These amendments had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of, nor is there expected to be any future 
impact to the Group.
(b) New standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 
1 January 2020 and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. None of these are expected to have 
a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
Amendments to IFRS 16 ‘Covid-19 Related Rent Concessions’
On 28 May 2020, the IASB issued Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions - amendment to IFRS 16 Leases. The amendments provide relief to 
lessees from applying IFRS 16 guidance on lease modification accounting for rent concessions arising as a direct consequence of the 
Covid-19 pandemic. As a practical expedient, a lessee may elect not to assess whether a Covid-19 related rent concession from a lessor is 
a lease modification. A lessee that makes this election accounts for any change in lease payments resulting from the Covid-19 related 
rent concession the same way it would account for the change under IFRS 16, if the change were not a lease modification.
The amendment applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 June 2020. Earlier application is permitted. Although the 
Group has received rental concessions in some contracts, this amendment has no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the 
Group as it has chosen not to apply and does not plan to adopt the practical expedient.
Onerous Contracts – Costs of Fulfilling a Contract – Amendments to IAS 37
In May 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 37 to specify which costs an entity needs to include when assessing whether a contract 
is onerous or loss-making. The amendments apply a “directly related cost approach”. The costs that relate directly to a contract to 
provide goods or services include both incremental costs and an allocation of costs directly related to contract activities. General and 
administrative costs do not relate directly to a contract and are excluded unless they are explicitly chargeable to the counterparty under 
the contract. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022. The Group will apply 
these amendments to contracts for which it has not yet fulfilled all its obligations at the beginning of the annual reporting period in 
which it first applies the amendments. The current accounting policies are not expected to deviate significantly from the amendments 
to IAS 37 but a further detailed assessment of the impact of the amendments is required.

Classification of liabilities as current or non-current - Amendments to IAS 1
The amendments clarify:
• Wha
t is meant by a right to defer settlement
• Tha
t a right to defer must exist at the end of the reporting period
• Tha
t classification is unaffected by the likelihood that an entity will exercise its deferral right 
•  Tha

classification
Companies are required to apply the amendments for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023, with early application 
permitted. A further detailed assessment of the impact of the amendments is required.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
2.2 Consolidation
(a) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the 
Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are 
deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a 
subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests 
issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are 
measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an 
acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognised amounts of 
acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in 
the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date; any gains or losses arising from such remeasurement are recognised in 
the income statement.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to 
the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised in accordance with IFRS 9 either in 
the income statement or as a change to other comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not 
remeasured and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value 
of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the 
total of consideration transferred, non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest measured is less than the fair value of 
the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are 
also eliminated. When necessary amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform with the Group’s accounting policies.
(b) Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of control
Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions – that is, as 
transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant 
share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. 
Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.
(c) Disposal of a business
When the Group ceases to have control in a business, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value at the date when control 
is lost, with the change in carrying amount recognised in the income statement. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of 
subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that business are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related 
assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the profit or loss.

(d) Associates
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, accompanying a shareholding of between 
20 an
d 50 per cent of the voting rights or based on the representation on the board of directors. Investments in associates are 
accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, the investment is initially recognised at cost and 
the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investor’s share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date 
of acquisition.  
The Group’s investment in associates includes goodwill identified on acquisition.
If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts 
previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to the income statement, where appropriate.
The Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the income statement and its share of post-acquisition movements in 
other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of 
the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other 
unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made 
payments on behalf of the associate.
The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. 
If th
is is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate 
and it
s carrying value and recognises the amount in the income statement.
Profits and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and its associate are recognised in the Group’s financial statements 
only to the extent of unrelated investor’s interests in the associates. Unrealised losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides 
evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. When necessary amounts reported by associates have been adjusted to conform 
with the Group’s accounting policies.
(e) Joint arrangements
Investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint ventures or joint operations depending on the contractual rights and obligations. 
Joint ventures are joint arrangements whereby the Group and other parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net 
assets of the joint venture. The parties to the arrangement have agreed contractually that control is shared and decisions regarding relevant 
activities require unanimous consent of the parties which have joint control of the joint venture.
Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially 
recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and movements in other 
comprehensive income. When the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interests in the joint ventures (which includes any 
long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the joint ventures), the Group does not recognise further losses, 
unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint ventures.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint 
ventures. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Joint operations are joint arrangements whereby the Group and other parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets 
and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the joint operation. The Group recognises its share in the joint operations’ individual revenues and 
expenses, assets and liabilities and includes it on a line-by-line basis with corresponding items in the Group’s financial statements.
2.3 Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Executive Board. The Executive Board 
considers the business from a sector perspective and identifies Construction and Property, Civil engineering and PPP as operating segments. 
As further explained below, as per 31 December 2020, PPP is classified as a discontinued operation.
2.4 Foreign currency translation
(a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in ‘euro’ (€), 
which is the Group’s presentation currency.

Royal BAM Group nv93Integrated Report 2020
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or 
valuation where items are remeasured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the 
translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income 
statement within ‘exchange rate differences’.
(c) Group companies
The results and financial position of the group companies that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are 
translated into the presentation currency as follows:
• ass
ets and liabilities for each balance sheet are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
• inc
ome and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates; and
• all r
esulting exchange rate differences are recognised separately in equity in ‘other comprehensive income’.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate. Exchange rate differences arising are recognised in ‘other comprehensive income’.
(d) Exchange rates
The following exchange rates of the euro against the pound sterling (£) have been used in the preparation of these financial statements:
2020 2019
Closing exchange rate
Pound sterling 0.90171 0.85332
Average exchange rate
Pound sterling 0.88703 0.87758
2.5 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Historical cost includes 
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of the items.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable 
that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Other 
costs are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost to their residual 
values over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Land improvements 10%-25%
Buildings 2%-10%
Equipment and installations 10%-25%
IT equipment 10%-25%
Furniture and fixtures 10%-25%
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its 
estimated recoverable amount (note 2.8). 
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within ‘other 
operating expenses’ in the income statement.
2.6 Right-of-use assets
The Group recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). 
Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses and adjusted for any remeasurement of 
lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease 

Page 94:
94Integrated Report 2020 Royal BAM Group nv
payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Unless the Group is reasonably certain to obtain 
ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognised right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 
the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment testing. The estimated useful life of 
the leased assets are as follows:
Land and buildings 1 to 99 years
Cars 1 to 10 years
Equipment 1 to 11 years
IT equipment 1 to 10 years
Other 1 to 10 years
The majority of the lease contracts in land and builings has a useful life up to 40 years. 
The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 
12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets 
recognition exemption that are considered of low value (i.e., below €5,000). Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value 
assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the 
lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be 
exercised. 
For several leases, the Group has renewal/extension options. The Group applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain 
to exercise the option to renew. That is, it considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise the renewal. 
After the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant change in circumstances that is within its 
control and affects its ability to exercise (or not to exercise) the option to renew (e.g., a change in business strategy). 
The assessment of whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise such options impacts the lease term, which significantly affects 
the amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets recognised. See note 4.
2.7 Intangible assets
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the Group’s interest in net fair 
value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree and the amount of the non-controlling interest in the 
acquiree.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in business combinations is allocated, at acquisition date, to the cash- 
generating units (CGUs) or groups of CGUs expected to benefit from that business combination. Each unit to which the goodwill is 
allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential 
impairment. The carrying value of the CGU containing the goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in 
use and the fair value less costs of disposal. Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.
(b) Non-integrated software
Non-integrated software is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation on non-integrated software is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost to their residual values over 
their estimated useful lives (between four and ten years). The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if 
appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
(c) Other
Other intangible assets relate to market positions ( including brand names) and development cost and are stated at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Research cost are expensed as incurred. Development cost on an individual project are recognised as an intangible asset when the 
following can be demonstrated:
• tec
hnical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that the asset will be available for use or sale;
• its i
ntention to complete and its ability and intention to use or sell the asset;

Royal BAM Group nv95Integrated Report 2020
• how the asset will generate future economic benefits;
• the av
ailability of resources to complete the asset;
• the a
bility to measure reliably the expenditure during development.
Following initial recognition of the development expenditure as an asset, the asset is carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation 
and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation of the asset begins when development is complete and the asset is available for use. 
Additional recognition of cost of development may apply when development continues. It is amortised over the period of expected future 
benefit. Amortisation is recorded in depreciation and amortisation charges. During the period of development, the asset is tested for 
impairment annually. 
Amortisation on other intangible assets is calculated over their estimated useful lives (generally between two and ten years). The assets’ 
useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
2.8 Impairment of non-financial assets
Intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life or intangible assets not ready to use are not subject to amortisation and are tested 
annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the 
asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal 
and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely 
independent cash inflows (CGUs). Prior impairments of non-financial assets (other than goodwill) are reviewed for possible reversal at each 
reporting date. 
2.9 Assets and liabilities held for sale and discontinued operations  
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use. For this to be the case the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate 
sale in its present condition and its sale must be highly probable. Non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale are 
measured at the lower of the asset’s carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell. Depreciation or amortisation of an asset 
ceases when it is classified as held for sale. Equity accounting ceases for an investment in a joint venture or associate when it is 
classified as held for sale.
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale, and represents a 
separate major line of business or geographical area of operations or is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major 
line of business or geographical area of operations. Results from discontinued operations that are clearly identifiable as part of the 
component disposed of and that will not be recognised subsequent to the disposal are presented separately as a single amount in the 
income statement. Results from discontinued operations are reclassified for prior periods and presented in the financial statements so 
that the results and cash flows from discontinued operations relate to all operations that have been discontinued as of the balance sheet 
date for the latest period presented.
2.10 Financial assets
2.
10.1 Cla
ssification
Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial 
assets were acquired or issued. In principle, the financial assets are held in a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows over the 
lifetime of the instrument. The Group’s financial assets comprise ‘PPP receivables’, ‘other financial assets’, ‘derivate financial instruments’, ‘(trade) 
receivables – net’, ‘contract assets’, ‘contract receivables’ and ‘cash and cash equivalents’ in the balance sheet.
The Group classifies its financial assets in the classes ‘debt instruments at amortized costs’, ‘financial assets at fair value through profit and loss’ and 
‘derivative financial instruments’ (note 2.13). debt instruments at amortised costs are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable 
payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than twelve months after the 
end of the reporting period which are classified as non-current assets. Debt instruments that do not meet Solely Payments of Principal and Interest 
(SPPI) criterion (for which the test is performed at instrument level) are classified at other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.

Page 96:
96Integrated Report 2020 Royal BAM Group nv
2.10.2 Recognition and measurement
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. 
Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or 
loss. Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs are expensed in 
the income statement, which also applicable for net changes in fair value after initial recognition. Trade receivables that do not contain a 
significant financing component are initially measured at the transaction price determined under IFRS 15. (See note 2.26 for revenue 
recognition).
Debt instruments, other than those initially measured in accordance with IFRS 15, are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method and are subject to impairment. The Group measures debt instruments at amortised cost if both of the 
following conditions are met: 
• the deb
t instruments is held with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; 
• the contractual terms of the debt instruments give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and 
Interest on the principal amount outstanding. 
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and 
the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the asset 
is derecognised, modified or impaired.
2.11 Offsetting financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to 
offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in 
the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the company or the counterparty.
2.12 Impairment of financial assets
If the credit risk on a financial asset, not held at fair value through profit or loss, has not increased significantly since initial recognition, 
the loss allowance for that financial instrument is the 12-month expected credit losses (ECL). If the credit risk on a financial asset has 
significantly changed since initial recognition the loss allowance equals the lifetime expected credit losses. A financial asset is written off 
when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows.
Indications of increase in credit risk for financial assets are if a debtor or a group of debtors:
• exp
erience significant financial difficulty;
• are i
n default or delinquency in interest or principal payments;
• hav
e increased probability of default;
• other
 observable data resulting in increased credit risk.
For all financial assets, not held at fair value through profit or loss, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the 
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest 
rate, taking into account the value of collateral, if any. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is 
recognised in the income statement. If a loan has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the 
current effective interest rate determined under the contract.
ECLs are recognised in two stages. For credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial 
recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 12-months (a 12-month 
ECL). For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is 
required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (a lifetime ECL).
For trade receivables, contract assets and contract receivables, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the 
Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group 
has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the 
debtors and the economic environment.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event 
occurring after the impairment was recognised, the reversal of the previously recognised impairment loss is recognised in the 
income statement.

2.13 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivatives are only used for economic hedging purposes and not as speculative investments. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair 
value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value. The method of recognising 
the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and if so, the nature of the item being 
hedged. The Group designates the derivatives as hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly 
probable forecast transaction or the foreign currency risk of the unrecognised Group’s commitment.
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its 
risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both 
at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in 
offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. 
A hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting if it meets all of the following effectiveness requirements:
• there
 is ‘an economic relationship’ between the hedged item and the hedging instrument;
• the ef
fect of credit risk does not ‘dominate the value changes’ that result from that economic relationship;
• the hed
ge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the Group actually 
hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Group actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.
The fair values of the derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in note 21. Movements on the hedging 
reserve in other comprehensive income are shown in note 17. The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or 
liability when the remaining hedged item is more than twelve months and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the 
hedged item is less than twelve months.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating 
to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement within ‘finance income/expense’.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss. 
The ga
in or loss relating to the effective portion of interest rate swaps hedging variable rate borrowings is recognised in the income 
statement within ‘finance income/expense’. The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of forward foreign exchange contracts is 
recognised in profit or loss within ‘operating result’.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or 
loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income 
statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is 
immediately transferred to the income statement within ‘finance income/expense’.
2.14 Inventories
Land, building rights and property developments are recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The Group capitalises 
interest on finance raised to facilitate the development of specific projects once development commences and until practical 
completion, based on the total actual finance cost incurred on the borrowings during the period. When properties are acquired for 
future redevelopment, interest on borrowings is recognised in the income statement until redevelopment commences. Raw materials 
and finished goods are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the ‘first-in, first-out (FIFO) method’. 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
2.15 Construction contracts
The Group defines a construction contract as a contract specifically negotiated for the construction of an asset. On the balance sheet, the 
Group reports the net contract position for each (construction) contract as either an contract asset or a contract liability. A contract asset is 
recognised when the Group has a right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the entity has transferred to a customer when 
that right is conditioned on something other than the passage of time. A contract receivable is an amount to be billed for which payment is 
only a matter of passage of time. A contract liability is recognised when the Group has an obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer 
for which the entity has received consideration (or the amount is due) from the customer. A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when 
the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.
For further guidelines regarding construction contracts see paragraph 2.26 revenue recognition under (a).

Page 98:
98Integrated Report 2020 Royal BAM Group nv
2.16 Trade and other receivables 
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for services performed in the ordinary course of business. If collection is expected in 
one year or less, they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.
Trade and other receivables, other than those measured in accordance to IFRS 15, are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any expected credit loss.
2.17 Cash and cash equivalents
In the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other 
short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts. In the consolidated balance 
sheet, bank overdrafts are shown within ‘borrowings’ in current liabilities.
2.18 Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the 
proceeds. When share capital is repurchased in order to prevent dilution as a result of the share-based compensation plan, the 
consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, net of tax, is deducted from equity. Repurchased shares (treasury shares) are 
presented as a deduction from total equity. When treasury shares are sold or re-issued subsequently, any amount received is recognised 
as an increase in equity, and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is transferred to/from retained earnings.
2.19 Trade and other payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accounts 
payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
2.20 Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised 
cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement 
over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method (in case not attributable to property development projects).
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that 
some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no 
evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity 
services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.
The subordinated convertible bonds are separated into liability and equity components based on the terms of the contract. On 
issuance of the subordinated convertible bonds, the fair value of the liability component is determined using a market rate for an 
equivalent non-convertible instrument. This amount is classified as a financial liability measured at amortised cost (net of 
transaction costs) until it is extinguished on conversion or redemption. The remainder of the proceeds is allocated to the conversion 
option that is recognised and included in equity (after tax). The carrying amount of the conversion option is not remeasured in 
subsequent years.
Transaction costs are deducted from equity, net of associated income tax. Transaction costs are apportioned between the liability 
and equity components of the subordinated convertible bonds, based on the allocation of proceeds to the liability and equity 
components when the instruments are initially recognised.
2.21 Lease liabilities
At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made 
over the lease term. Lease payments include fixed payments (including in- substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable,

non-lease components related to the leased asset, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be 
paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be 
exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to 
terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as an expense in the profit and loss.
In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date,  
if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is 
increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease 
liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a 
change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset. 
The Group has applied judgement to determine the lease term, which significantly affects the amount of right-of-use assets and lease 
liabilities recognised. See note 4 and note 20 Lease liabilities.
The Group:
•  has
 not separated non-lease components from lease components and instead each lease component and any associated non-lease 
components are accounted for as a single lease component. Variable lease payments such as petrol for cars or variable maintenance 
fees for buildings are excluded from the measurement of the lease liability;
•  use
d a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics. The Group determined incremental 
borrowing rates that are currency specific and vary with the length of the contract. The Group has used a more high-level method to 
determine the incremental borrowing rate. The Group has assessed the impact of the incremental borrowing rate determined using 
this method on the value of the lease liabities using a sensitivity analysis. Based upon this analysis, the Group concludes that the 
impact of using this method to determine the incremental borrowing rate has no material impact on the value of the lease liabilities.
Lease Modifications
A lease modification is a change in the scope of a lease, or the consideration for a lease, that was not part of the original terms and 
conditions of the lease - e.g. adding or terminating the right to use one or more underlying assets. Lease modifications are accounted for 
either as separate leases or not separate leases.
The Group accounts for lease modifications as separate lease if both:
• the mo
dification increases the scope of the lease by adding the right to use one or more underlying assets; and
•  the con
sideration for the lease increases by an amount equivalent to the stand-alone price for the increase in scope and any 
appropriate adjustments to that stand-alone price to reflect the circumstances of the particular contract.
For a lease modification that is not accounted for as a separate lease, the Group shall remeasure the lease liability using a revised 
discount rate. The adjustment to the lease liability is accounted for against the right of use asset with no profit and loss impact, with the 
exception of decreases in scope of the lease. In this case, a gain or loss to reflect the partial or full termination is recognized.
Sale and leaseback transactions
A sale and leaseback transaction comprises two separate transactions:
• the s
ale of an asset previously held by the selling entity; and
• an ag
reement to lease the same asset, usually from the purchasing entity.
The Group applies the requirements for determining when a performance obligation is satisfied in IFRS 15 to determine whether the 
transfer of an asset is accounted for as a sale. When the transfer of the asset satisfies the requirements of IFRS 15, the Group, as a 
seller-lessee measures the right-of-use asset arising from the leaseback at the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the asset 
that relates to the right of use retained by the seller-lessee. Accordingly, the Group recognizes only the amount of any gain or loss that 
relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor.
 
2.22 Current and deferred income tax
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that 
it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other 
comprehensive income respectively directly in equity.

Page 100:
100Integrated Report 2020 Royal BAM Group nv
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the 
countries where the Group operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect 
to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts 
expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial 
recognition of goodwill; deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction 
other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred 
income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are 
expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets 
are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow 
the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred income tax liabilities are provided on taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates and 
joint arrangements, except for deferred income tax liability where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by 
the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised on deductible temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates and 
joint arrangements only to the extent that it is probable the temporary difference will reverse in the future and there is sufficient taxable 
profit available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on 
either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
2.23 Employee benefits
(a) Pension obligations
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no legal 
or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating 
to employee service in the current and prior periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan.
Typically defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on 
one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by 
independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by 
discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the 
currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation. 
In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market rates on government bonds are used.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited in other 
comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Current service costs of defined benefit plans are recognised immediately in the income statement, as part of ‘employee benefit 
expenses’, and reflect the increase in the defined benefit obligation resulting from employee service in the current year, benefit changes, 
curtailments and settlements.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement. Interest expenses are included in the ‘employee benefit expenses’.
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or 
voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised

as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a 
reduction in the future payments is available.
(b) Other employment obligations
Other employment obligations comprise jubilee benefits, retirement gifts, temporary leaves and similar arrangements and have a 
non-current nature. These obligations are stated at present value.
(c) Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an 
employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits at the earlier of the 
following dates: (a) when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and (b) when the entity recognises costs for a 
restructuring and involves the payment of termination benefits. In the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the 
termination benefits are measured based on the number of employees expected to accept the offer. Benefits falling due more than 
12 mo
nths after the end of the reporting period are discounted to their present value.
2.24 Share-based payments
(a) Performance Share Plan
The Group operates an equity-settled share-based compensation plan.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the shares is recognised as cost with a corresponding credit 
entry of equity. The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting 
conditions are to be satisfied. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares granted:
• inc
luding a market performance condition based on the Company’s share price;
• exc
luding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions; and
• incl
uding the impact of any non-vesting conditions.
At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of shares that are expected to vest based on the 
non-market vesting conditions and service conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income 
statement within ‘personnel expenses’, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
In addition, in some circumstances employees may provide services in advance of the grant date and therefore the grant date fair value 
is estimated for the purposes of recognising the expense during the period between service commencement period and grant date.
These shares contain a dividend right, to which the same conditions apply as to the performance shares and are re-invested.
(b) Phantom Share Plan
The Group used to operate a cash-settled share-based compensation plan, for which the last payment occurred in May 2019.
2.25 Provisions
Provisions for warranties, restructuring costs, rental guarantees, associates and joint ventures and onerous contracts are recognised 
when: (a) the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; (b) it is probable that an outflow of resources 
will be required to settle the obligation; and (c) the amount has been reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision 
due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.
Restructuring provisions are recognised when a detailed formal plan has been approved, and the restructuring has either commenced or 
has been announced publicly. Restructuring provisions comprise lease termination penalties and employee termination payments.
Future operating losses are not recognised.
If the Group’s share in losses exceeds the carrying amount of the investment (including separately presented goodwill and other 
uninsured receivables), further losses will not be recognised, unless the Group has provided securities to the associate or joint venture, 
committed to liabilities or payment on behalf of the associate and joint venture. In that case, the excess will be provided for.

2.26 Revenue recognition
(a) Construction contracts
IFRS 15 follows a 5-step approach to recognise for revenue, which is set out below. Certain specific topics have been included or referred 
to the applicable note. 
The core principle of IFRS 15 is a 5-step model to distinguish each distinct performance obligation within a contract that the Group has 
with its customer and to recognise revenue on the level of the performance obligations, reflecting the consideration that the Group 
expects to be entitled for, in exchange for those goods or services. 
The following five steps are identified within IFRS 15:
• ste
p 1 ‘Identify the contract with the client’: Agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations 
(not necessarily written);
• ste
p 2 ‘Identify the performance obligations’: A promise in a contract with a customer to transfer a good or service to the customer;
• ste
p 3 ‘Determine the transaction price’: The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled 
for in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a client;
• ste
p 4 ‘Allocate the transaction price’: The objective of allocating the transaction price is for the Group to allocate the transaction 
price to each performance obligation;
• ste
p 5 ‘Recognise revenue’: the Group recognises revenue when (or as) the Group satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a 
promised good or service (that is an asset) to a client.
Step 1 ‘Identify the contract with the client’
IFRS 15.9 requires that five criteria must be met before an entity accounts for a contract with a client. Once an arrangement has met the 
criteria, the Group does not assess the criteria again unless there are indicators of significant changes in the facts or circumstances. 
The achievement of the preferred bid status is not considered as a contract. As from the achievement of the preferred bid status, costs 
will be capitalised as an asset if enforceability of right to payment exists. This mainly concerns costs to fulfil the contract. See note 14 for 
further details.
Multiple contracts are combined and accounted for as a single contract when the economics of the individual contracts cannot be 
understood without reference to the arrangement as a whole. Indicators that such a combination is required are:
(a) the con
tracts are negotiated as a package with a single commercial objective;
(b) the am
ount of consideration to be paid in one contract depends on the price or the performance of the other contract;
(c) the goo
ds or services promised in the contracts (or some goods or services promised in each of the contracts) are a single 
performance obligation.
A change to an existing contract for a project of the Group is a modification. A contract modification could change the scope of the 
contract, the price of the contract, or both. A contract modification exists when the Group and the customer approve the modification 
either in writing, orally, or implied by customary business practices, making the modification enforceable. In accordance with IFRS 15 the 
Group uses three methods to account for a contract modification:
(a) as a
 separate contract when the modification promises distinct goods (according to IFRS 15.27) or services and the price reflects the 
stand alone selling price;
(b) as a cu
mulative catch-up adjustment when the modification does not add distinct goods or services and is part of the same 
performance obligation. For the Group, as common within the construction sector, modifications mainly relate to variation orders 
which do not result in additional distinct goods and services and have to be accounted for as cumulative catch-up adjustment. This is 
the most common method within the Group given the nature of the modifications; or
(c) as a prospective adjustment when the considerations from the distinct goods or services do not reflect their standalone selling prices.
Step 2 ‘Identify the performance obligations’
The purpose of this step is to identify all promised goods or services that are included in the contract. Examples of performance 
obligations are the construction of a building, the delivery of an apartment, the maintenance of a road and so on.
At contract inception, the Group assesses the goods or services promised to a customer, and identifies each promise as either:
(a) a goo
d or service (or a bundle of goods or services) that is distinct; or
(b) a ser
ies of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. 
Promises in a contract can be explicit, or implicit if they create a valid expectation that the Group will provide a good or service based on 
the Group’s customary business practices, published policies or specific statements.

Royal BAM Group nv103Integrated Report 2020
Building and maintenance contracts are usually considered as separate performance obligations because these promises are 
separately identifiable and the customer can benefit from these promises on their own. Design and build contracts are usually 
accounted for as one performance obligation because of not meeting criterion IFRS 15.27 (b) The entity’s promise to transfer the 
good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. These promises usually represent a 
combined output for the customer (the construction) for which the design is the input. However if the purpose of the contract is to 
deliver a separate design after which the client is also able to contract another construction company, the design is considered to be 
separately identifiable.
When assets are built at clearly different (unconnected) locations these are generally considered to qualify as separate performance obligations. 
Performance obligations with the same characteristics can be bundled into portfolios if the entity reasonably expects that the 
effects on the financial statements of applying IFRS 15 to the portfolio would not differ materially from applying the standard to all 
performance obligations individually (for example: apartments).
Onerous contracts:
IFRS 15 does not include specific guidance about the accounting for project losses. For the accounting of provisions for onerous 
contracts, IFRS 15 refers to the guidance relating to provisions in IAS 37. Based on IAS 37, a provision for an onerous contract has to 
be accounted for on the level of the contract as a whole. This is not necessarily the same as if evaluated on project level, because a 
contract may include more performance obligations. 
The provision for onerous construction contracts only relates to the future loss on the performance to be delivered under the 
contract. In determining a provision for an onerous contract, the inclusion of variable considerations in the expected economic 
benefits is based on the same principles as included in step 3 hereafter, including the application of the highly probable constraint 
for the expected revenue. The provision for onerous contracts is presented separately in the balance sheet.
Step 3 ‘Determine the transaction price’
The purpose of this step is to determine the transaction price of the performance obligations promised in the contract. The 
transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised 
goods or services to a customer. The transaction price can be a fixed amount, a variable consideration or a combination of both.
If the consideration promised includes a variable amount such as an unpriced variation order, a claim, an incentive or a penalty, the 
Group estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services 
to a customer. IFRS 15 provides two methods for estimating variable considerations: the sum of probability-weighted amounts in a 
range of possible consideration amounts or the most likely amount a range of possible consideration amounts. On the level of each 
performance obligation has to be decided which approach best predicts the amount of the consideration to which the Group will be 
entitled.
The Group includes a variable consideration estimated only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the 
amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is 
subsequently resolved (called the ‘constraint’).
The Group is often exposed to uncertainties related to variable considerations such as variation orders and contract claims to 
customers. The measurement of variation orders and claims requires knowledge and judgement by the Group. Based on IFRS 15, 
the Gr
oup interprets variation orders and contract claims as contract modifications for which the consideration is variable. 
For the accounting of unpriced variation orders and claims the following elements are assessed:
(a) dete
rmine whether the rights and obligations of the parties to the contract that are created or changed by the variation order or 
contract claim are enforceable; 
(b) esti
mate the change to the transaction price for the variation order or contract claim; 
(c) appl
y the guidance relating the constraint of the estimate of variable considerations (meaning that it is highly probable that no 
significant reversal of revenue will occur);
(d) dete
rmine whether the variation order or contract claim should be accounted for on a prospective basis or a cumulative  
catch-up basis.
For c
onsidering the effects of constraining estimates of variable considerations, the Group makes a distinction between claims and 
variation orders. Variation orders are changes that are clearly instructed by the client creating enforceable rights to payment but for 
which the price change is not yet determined. Claims however relate to events for which the Group considers to have enforceable 
rights to a compensation from the client but these are not yet approved by the client. The uncertainty relating to claims is usually 

Page 104:
104Integrated Report 2020 Royal BAM Group nv
higher, because of the absence of an instruction of the client for a change. As a result the risk of a significant reversal of revenue 
relating to claims is considered to be higher and it might be more difficult to prove that a claim amount meets the IFRS 15 ‘highly 
probable’ criterion.See note 4 b) for the related criteria.
Other variable considerations might include bonuses and penalties, for which penalties are considered to be negative variable 
considerations. The same method as described above needs to be applied, including assessing the constraint.
When determining the transaction price, the Group adjusts the promised amount of consideration for the effects of the time value of 
money if the timing of payments agreed to by the parties to the contract (either explicitly or implicitly) provides the customer or the 
entity with a significant benefit of financing the transfer of goods or services to the customer. In those circumstances, the contract 
contains a significant financing component. A significant financing component may exist regardless of whether the promise of 
financing is explicitly stated in the contract or implied by the payment terms agreed to by the parties to the contract. As a practical 
expedient the Group does not account for a financing component if the entity expects at contract inception that the period between 
the delivery of goods or services and the payment is one year or less. 
Step 4 ‘Allocate the transaction price’
The objective when allocating the transaction price is to allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount 
that depicts the amount of consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods 
or services to the customer.
To meet the allocation objective, the Group allocates the total transaction price agreed in the contract (or combination of contracts) 
as determined in step 3 to the performance obligations identified in step 2. This allocation is based on the relative stand-alone selling 
price (SSP) of the individual performance obligations.
To allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, the Group determines 
the stand-alone selling price at contract inception of the distinct good or service underlying each performance obligation in the 
contract and allocate the transaction price in proportion to those stand-alone selling prices.
The estimation method of IFRS 15 that best reflects the stand-alone selling price for design, construction and maintenance projects is 
the expected cost plus margin approach. This approach requires to forecast its expected costs of satisfying the performance 
obligation and then add an appropriate margin for that type of project or service. Costs included in the estimation should be 
consistent with those costs the Group would usually consider in setting standalone selling prices. Both direct and indirect costs are 
considered. The Group substantiates for example the average margin on bids for similar projects/services on a stand-alone basis 
(not in combination with other performance obligations).
Step 5 ‘Recognise revenue’
The purpose of this step is to determine the amount of revenue to be recognised in a certain period.
The Group recognises revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service 
(i.e. an asset) to a customer. An asset is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that asset. For each performance 
obligation identified in the contract, the Group determines at contract inception whether it satisfies the performance obligation over 
time or satisfies the performance obligation at a point in time. 
Control refers to the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the asset. Control includes 
the ability to prevent other entities from directing the use of, and obtaining the benefits from, an asset. The Group needs to 
determine, at contract inception, whether control of a good or service transfers to a customer over time or at a point in time. 
Revenue is recognised over time if any of the following three criteria are met:
(a)
 the cu
stomer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity’s performance as the entity performs;
(b) the e
ntity’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced;
(c) the e
ntity’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity and the entity has an enforceable right to 
payment for performance completed to date.
In general, the Group is building on the land of the customer or improving an asset of the customer, which results in creating an asset that the 
customer controls as the asset is created. This leads to recognising revenue over time. The Group uses the ‘percentage-of-completion 
method’ to determine the appropriate amount to recognise in a given period for a performance obligation. 
The stage of completion is measured by reference to the contract costs of fulfilling the performance obligation incurred up to the end of the 
reporting period as a percentage of total expected fulfilment costs under the contract, which is an input measure according to IFRS 15.

Costs incurred in connection with future activity on a contract are excluded from contract costs in determining the stage of completion. 
Payment terms might differ from client to client and country to country, however the Group’s standard payment term states 60 days. 
When applying a method for measuring progress, the Group excludes the measure of progress of any goods or services for which the 
entity has not transferred control to a customer. Examples of costs which have to be excluded from the progress measurement, include 
uninstalled materials, capitalised cost and costs of inefficiencies. 
Uninstalled materials:
If a customer contributes goods or services (for example, materials, equipment or labour) to facilitate the Groups’ fulfilment of the 
contract, the Group assesses whether it obtains control of those contributed goods or services. If so, the Group accounts for the 
contributed goods or services as non-cash consideration received from the customer. This is however rare, since control usually is not 
transferred to the Group and stays with the customer.
Capitalised cost:
The capitalised contract cost include cost to obtain the contract, cost to fulfil the contract and set-up cost. The Group recognises 
capitalised contract cost from the costs incurred to fulfil a contract (for example set-up or mobilisation costs) only if those costs meet all of 
the following criteria:
• the c
osts relate directly to a contract or to an anticipated contract that the entity can specifically identify (for example, costs relating to 
services to be provided under renewal of an existing contract or costs of designing an asset to be transferred under a specific contract 
that has not yet been approved);
• the co
sts generate or enhance resources of the entity that will be used in satisfying (or in continuing to satisfy) performance obligations 
in the future; and;
• the c
osts are expected to be recovered (project result should be sufficient to cover the capitalised contract costs).
Capitalised contract costs shall be amortized over the lifetime of the contract.
Costs of inefficiencies:
The Group does not recognise revenue for costs incurred that are attributable to significant inefficiencies in the Group’s performance that 
were not reflected in the price of the contract since these costs do not contribute to any benefits for the customer. This includes costs of 
unexpected amounts of wasted materials, labour or other resources that were incurred to satisfy the performance obligation.
Not all cost overruns compared to the project budget relate to inefficiencies. Cost overruns that for example relate to price increases, 
design changes (regardless whether compensated by the client), inaccuracies in the project budget are not inefficiencies. These expenses 
still contribute to value to the customer and making progress in the delivery of the project. Inefficiency costs relate to wasted items or 
work performed, which do not reflect any progress in the satisfaction of the performance obligation nor value to the customer. The costs 
incurred related to significant inefficiencies are directly charged to the income statement. Consequently, significant inefficiency costs are 
excluded from the measurement of the stage of completion.
(b) Property development
Sale of property development are recognised in respect of contracts exchanged during the year, provided that no material conditions 
remain outstanding on the balance sheet date and all conditions are fully satisfied by the date on which the contract is signed.
Further the accounting policies for property development are the same as mentioned under (a).
(c) Service concession arrangements and other
Under the terms of IFRIC 12 ‘Service concession arrangements’ comprise construction and/or upgrade activities, as well as operating and 
maintenance activities. Both activities recognise revenue in conformity with IFRS 15. The consideration (concession payments) received is allocated 
between construction/upgrade activities and operating/maintenance services according to the relative Stand-alone selling prices of the individual 
performance obligations.
The financial assets relating to service concession arrangements (‘PPP receivables’) are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Interest is 
calculated using the effective interest method and is recognised in the income statement as ‘finance income’.
Sales of services are recognised when a performance obligations is satisfied. Usually, revenues from services are recognised over time by reference 
to the stage of completion on the basis of the actual service costs realised respective to the total expected service costs under the contract.
Other revenue includes, among other items, rental income and (sub)lease of property, plant and/or equipment. When assets are leased 
out under an operating lease, the asset is included in the balance sheet based on the nature of the asset. Lease income on operating leases 
is recognised over the term of the lease on a straight-line basis.

Page 106:
106Integrated Report 2020 Royal BAM Group nv
2.27 Finance income and expenses
Finance income is recognised using the effective interest method. When a loan and receivable is impaired, the Group reduces the carrying amount 
to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash flow discounted at the original effective interest rate of the instrument and continues 
unwinding the discount as interest income. Finance income on impaired loan and receivables is recognised using the original effective interest rate.
Finance expenses comprise interest expenses on borrowings, deposits, cash positions, lease liabilities, finance lease expenses, gains and 
losses relating to hedging instruments and other financial expenses. Interest expenses on borrowings and lease liabilities are recognised in 
the income statement using the effective interest method.
2.28 Government grants
Government grants are not recognised until there is a reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to 
them and that the grants will be reviewed.
Government grants that are receivable as a compensation for expenses or losses already incurred are recognised in the income statement in the period 
in which they become receivable. The Group presents such government grants as a reduction to the related expenses in the income statement. 
2.29 Adjusted items
Adjusted items as presented in these financial statements in amongst other  the segment analysis (see note 5) is based on BAM’s definition 
of adjusted result before tax and relate to impairment charges, restructuring costs and pension one-offs.
2.30 Statement of cash flows
The statement of cash flows is prepared using the indirect method. The net cash position in the statement of cash flows consists of cash 
and cash equivalents, net of bank overdrafts.
Cash flows in foreign exchange currencies are converted using the average exchange rate. Exchange rate differences on the net cash position are 
separately presented in the statement of cash flows. Payments in connection with interest and income tax are included in the cash flow from 
operation activities. Cash flows in connection with PPP receivables are included in the cash flow from operating activities. Paid dividend is 
included in cash flow from financing activities. The purchase price of acquisitions of subsidiaries are included in the cash flow from investing 
activities as far as payments have taken place. Cash and cash equivalents in the subsidiaries are deducted from the purchase price.
Cash flows from PPP’s are presented under cash flow from operating activities since these projects are part of regular construction and recurring 
maintenance revenue for BAM’s business lines and include concessions for roads, rail, education, health care and government buildings.
In the statement of cash flows the interest paid related to leases is presented as part of the cash flow from operating activities, while the 
repayments are presented as part of the cash flows from financing activities.
Non-cash transactions are not included in the statement of cash flows.
3. Financial risk management
3.1 Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities  are exposed to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and price 
risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. Risk is inherent to any business venture and the risk to which the Group is exposed is not unusual or 
different from what is considered acceptable in the industry. The Group’s risk management system is designed to identify and manage 
threats and opportunities. Effective risk management enables BAM to capitalise on opportunities in a carefully controlled environment. 
The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to limit potential adverse 
effects on the Group’s financial performance. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Financial risk management is carried out by Group treasury under policies approved by the Executive Board, which has the overall 
responsibility for risk management in the Group and the Enterprise Risk Management Framework. Group treasury identifies, evaluates and 
hedges financial risks in close collaboration with the group companies. The Executive Board provides written principles for overall risk

management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of 
derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments and investment of excess liquidity.
(a) Market risk
(i) Foreign exchange risk
A substantial part of the Group’s activities takes place in the United Kingdom and, to a limited extent, in other non-euro countries. 
The Group’s results and shareholders’ equity are therefore affected by foreign exchange rates. Generally, the Group is active in these non-euro 
countries through local subsidiaries. The exchange risk is therefore limited, because transactions are denominated largely in the functional 
currencies of the subsidiaries. The associated translation risk is not hedged. Due to the decrease of the exchange rate of the pound sterling in 
2020 , the reported revenue, results, equity and closing order book for the UK companies decreased. Based on the value per end of 2020 of the 
Group’s UK subsidiaries, an increase or decrease of 10 per cent of the exchange rate of the pound sterling, will have an effect on the Group’s 
equity of approximately €37 million.
A limited number of group companies are active in markets where contracts are denominated in a different currency than their 
functional currency. Group policy is that costs and revenues from these projects are mainly expressed in the same currency, thus limiting 
foreign exchange risks. The Group hedges the residual exchange risk on a project-by-project basis, using forward exchange contracts.
This involves hedging of unconditional project related exchange risks in excess of €1 million as soon as these occur. The Group reports 
these hedges by means of cash flow hedge accounting. Additional exchange risks in the tender stage and arising from contractual 
amendments are assessed on a case-by-case basis.
Procedures have been established for proper recording of hedge transactions. Systems are in place to ensure the regular performance 
and analysis of the requisite hedge effectiveness measurements for hedge accounting.
(ii) Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk is associated with interest-bearing receivables and cash and cash equivalents, on the one hand and 
interest-bearing borrowings, on the other. If the interest is variable, it presents the Group with a cash flow interest rate risk. If the interest 
rate is fixed, there is a fair value interest rate risk.
The Group mitigates the cash flow interest rate risk to the extent possible through the use of interest rate swaps, under which interest 
liabilities based on a variable rate are converted into fixed rates. The Group does not use interest rate swaps under which fixed-rate 
interest liabilities are converted into variable rates in order to hedge the fair value interest rate risk.
The analysis of the cash flow interest rate risk takes into account cash and cash equivalents, the debt position and the usual fluctuations in the 
Group’s working capital requirements, and lease liabilities are excluded. Under Group policy, cash flow interest rate risks with regard to long-
term borrowings are largely hedged by interest swaps. As a result of the small non-hedge component of these borrowings in combination with 
negative interest on part of the Groups credit positions, the Group is not entirely insensitive to movements in interest rates. At year-end 2020, 
20 per cent (2019: 63 per cent) of the interest on the Group’s debt position was fixed. The part not covered consists almost entirely of 
property financing.
If the interest rates (Euribor and Libor) had been an average of 100 basis points higher or lower during 2020, the Group’s net result after tax 
(assuming that all other variables remained equal) would have been approximately €1.1 million higher or approximately €2.0 million lower 
(2019: approximately €0.4 million higher or approximately €0.7 million lower). If the interest rates (Euribor and Libor) had been 100 basis 
points higher or lower as per 31 December 2020, the Group’s cash flow hedge reserves in Group equity (assuming that all other variables 
remained equal) would have been approximately €1.7 million higher or approximately €1.7 million lower (2019: approximately €2.1 million 
higher or approximately €2.1 million lower). 
As of 1 January 2022, Euribor and Libor will no longer be available and will be replaced by a new reference rate published by the European 
Central Bank: the Euro Short-Term Rate (€STR). Although there has not been any significant developments in the market so far, the Group is 
investigating the expected impact.
(iii) Price risk
The price risk run by the Group relates to the procurement of land and materials and subcontracting of work and consists of the difference 
between the market price at the point of tendering or offering on a contract and the market price at the time of actual performance.
The Group’s policy is to agree a price indexation reimbursement clause with the client at the point of tendering or offering on major 
projects. The Group also endeavours to manage the price risk by using framework contracts, suppliers’ quotations and high-value 
sources of information. If the Group is awarded a project and no price indexation reimbursement clause is agreed with the client, the 

Page 108:
108Integrated Report 2020 Royal BAM Group nv
costs of land and materials, as well as the costs for subcontractors, are frequently fixed at an early stage by establishing prices and 
conditions in advance with the main suppliers and subcontractors.
While it is impossible to exclude the impact of price fluctuations altogether, the Group takes the view that its current policy reflects the 
optimum economic balance between decisiveness and predictability. The Group occasionally uses financial instruments to hedge the 
(residual) price risks.
(b) Credit risk
The Group has credit risks with regard to financial assets including ‘non-current receivables’, ‘derivative financial instruments’, ‘trade 
receivables – net’, ‘contract assets’, ‘contract receivables’, ’other receivables’ and ‘cash and cash equivalents’.
Regarding the above mentioned financial assets, the Group assessed the credit risk and concluded that no material ECL provision is 
deemed necessary.
‘PPP receivables’ and a substantial part of the ‘trade receivables – net’ consist of contracts with governments or government bodies. 
Therefore, credit risk inherent in these contracts is limited. Furthermore, a significant part of ‘trade receivables – net’ is based on 
contracts involving prepayments or payments proportionate to progress of the work, which limits the credit risks, in principle, to the 
balances outstanding.
The credit risk arising from ‘trade receivables – net’, ‘contract assets’ and ‘contract receivables’ is monitored by the relevant subsidiaries. 
Clients’ creditworthiness is analysed in advance and then monitored during the performance of the project. This involves taking account of the 
client’s financial position, previous collaborations and other factors. Group policy is designed to mitigate these credit risks through the use of 
various instruments, including retaining ownership until payment has been received, prepayments and the use of bank guarantees. The credit 
risk of the portfolio is further mitigated by broad spectrum of clients.
The Group’s ‘cash and cash equivalents’ are held in various banks. The Group limits the associated credit risk as a result of the Group’s 
policy to work only with respectable banks and financial institutions. This involves ‘cash and cash equivalents’ in excess of €10 million 
being held at banks and financial institutions with a minimum rating of ‘A’. The Group’s policy aims to limit any concentration of credit 
risks involving ‘cash and cash equivalents’.
The carrying amounts of the financial assets exposed to a credit risk are as follows:
Notes 2020 2019

Non-current receivables predominantly concern loans granted to property and joint ventures. These loans are in general not past due at the 
balance sheet date. Triggering events for impairments are identified based on the financial position of these associates and joint ventures, 
which also include the value of the underlying property development positions. For a part of these loans property developments positions are 
held as securities generally subordinated to the providers of the external financing.
Impairments, if applicable, are included in ‘non-current receivables’ and ‘trade receivables – net’ (notes 12 and 14). None of the other 
assets were overdue at year-end 2020 or subject to impairment. The maximum credit risk relating to financial instruments equals the 
carrying amount of the financial instrument.

The Group has entered into certain parental and financial guarantees, which are included in note 34.2. No significant expected credit loss 
provision has been recognized regarding financial guarantees. 
(c) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risks may occur if the procurement and performance of new projects stagnate and less payments (and prepayments) are 
received, or if investments in land or property development would have a significant effect on the available financing resources and/or 
operational cash flows. 
The size of individual transactions can cause relatively large short-term fluctuations in the liquidity position. The Group has sufficient 
credit and current account facilities to manage these fluctuations. Credit facilities generally contain covenant obligations.
Partly to manage liquidity risks, subsidiaries prepare monthly detailed cash flow projections for the ensuing twelve months. The analysis 
of the liquidity risk takes into account the amount of cash and cash equivalents, credit facilities and the usual fluctuations in the Group’s 
working capital requirements. This provides the Group with sufficient opportunities to use its available liquidities and credit facilities as 
flexible as possible and to indicate any shortfalls in a timely manner. See further 2.1.3.
The first possible expected contractual cash outflows from financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments as at the end of the 
year and settled on a net basis, consist of (contractual) repayments and (estimated) interest payments.

The expected cash outflows are offset by the cash inflows from operations and (re-)financing. In addition, the Group has committed 
syndicated and bilateral credit facilities of €400 million (2019: €400 million) respectively €138 million (2019: € 138 million) in bilateral credit 
facilities and €25 million intraday facilities (2019: €25 million) available. The revolving credit facility was fully drawn in 2020 (2019: nil).
3.2 Capital management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide 
returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

Page 110:
110Integrated Report 2020 Royal BAM Group nv
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Group’s aim is for a financing structure that ensures continuing operations and minimises cost of equity. For this, flexibility and 
access to the financial markets are important conditions. As usual within the industry, the Group monitors its financing structure using a 
capital ratio, among other factors.
Capital ratio is calculated as the capital base divided by total assets. The Group’s capital base consists of equity attributable to the 
shareholders of the Company and the subordinated instruments (notes 18 and 19). At year-end 2020, the capital ratio was 13.4 per cent 
(2019: 16.5 per cent). For the strategic objectives regarding the capital ratio, see chapter 3.1 Financial performance of the Executive 
Board Report.
Under the terms of our borrowings facilities the group is required to comply with financial covenants. For information on these financial 
covenants see note 19 and 2.1.3.
3.3 Financial instruments by categories
The Group has three categories of financial instruments. A significant number of these are inherent to the Group’s business activities  
and are presented in various balance sheet items. The following summary indicates the values for which financial instruments  
are included for each relevant balance sheet item:

3.4 Fair value estimation 
The fair value of financial instruments not quoted in an active market is measured using valuation techniques. The Group uses various 
techniques and makes assumptions based on market conditions on balance sheet date. The valuation also includes (changes in) the credit 
risk of the counter party and the credit risk of the Group in conformity with IFRS 13.
One of these techniques is the calculation of the net present value of the expected cash flows (discounted cash flow projections). The fair 
value of the interest rate swaps is calculated as the net present value of the expected future cash flows. The fair value of the forward 
exchange contracts is measured based on the ‘forward’ currency exchange rates on balance sheet date. In addition, valuations from banks 
are requested for interest rate swaps.
Financial instruments valued at fair value consist of interest rate swaps, foreign exchange contracts and a portion of the other financial 
assets. In line with the current accounting policies the derivatives are classified as level 2. 
It is assumed that the nominal value (less estimated adjustments) of ‘borrowings’ (current part), ‘trade and other receivables’ and ‘trade 
and other payables’ approximate to their fair value.
3.5 Offsetting financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial position if there 
is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets 
and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
A master netting agreement is applicable to a part of ‘cash and cash equivalents’. At 31 December 2020 a positive balance of €1,304 million 
has been offset against a negative balance of nil (2019: positive balance of €446 million offset against a negative balance of €0.1 million).

4.  Critical accounting judgements and key sources  
of
 estimation uncertainties
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future 
events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and the curent market and Covid-19 conditions. The basis for these 
estimates remain unchanged compared to those described in the 2019 financial statements, provided that the estimation uncertainty has 
inherently increased due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. This has especially effect on the estimates made regarding the valuation of 
goodwill, deferred tax assets, projects, land and building rights and property development. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
The critical judgements including those involving estimation assumptions concerning the future that the Group has made in the process of 
applying the accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements 
are addressed below. Given the impact and gravity of Covid-19 it is noted that that the estimation uncertainty has inherently increased due to 
the pandemic. This could especially have effect on the estimates made regarding the valuation of goodwill, deferred tax assets, contract 
revenue and costs, land and building rights and property development. Actual results may differ from these estimates. See 2.1.2.
(a) Contract revenue and costs
The group recognizes revenue from construction contracts over time as it performs its obligations. For each performance obligation 
satisfied over time, the Group recognises revenue over time by measuring the progress towards full satisfaction of that performance 
obligation. The objective when measuring progress is to depict an entity’s performance in transferring control of goods or services 
promised to a customer (ie the satisfaction of an entity’s performance obligation). The Group  applies an input method to measure 
progress. At the end of each reporting period, the Group remeasures its progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance 
obligation satisfied over time. As work is performed on the assets being constructed they are controlled by the customer and have no 
alternative use to the Group, with the Group having a right to payment for performance to date.
When the progress towards completion can be measured reliably, contract revenue and costs are recognised over the period of the 
contract, usually by reference to the stage of completion using the ‘percentage-of- completion method’, to determine the appropriate 
amount to recognise in a given period. The Group measures the progress of the satisfaction of a performance obligation based on total cost 
incurred divided by total expected costs, which is an input measure according to IFRS 15.  When it is probable that total contract costs will 
exceed total contract revenue, the realised loss based on the ‘percentage-of-completion method’ is recognised as an expense immediately, 
while the future expected loss is included in a provision for onerous contracts. 
In determining the stage of completion the Group has efficient, coordinated systems for cost estimating, forecasting and revenue and costs 
reporting. The system also requires a consistent judgment (forecast) of the final outcome of the project, including variance analyses of 
divergences compared with earlier assessment dates. Estimates are an inherent part of this assessment and actual future outcome may 
deviate from the estimated outcome, specifically for major and complex construction contracts. However, historical experience has also 
shown that estimates are, on the whole, sufficiently reliable. Estimates and judgements are made relating to a number of factors when 
assessing construction contracts. These primarily include the programme of work throughout the contract period, assessment of future 
costs after considering changes in the scope of work, maintenance and defect liabilities and performance bonuses and penalties.
See paragraph 2.26 for further explanation regarding the recognition of revenue for construction contracts. 
(b) Unpriced variation orders
Variation orders are changes that are clearly instructed by the client. The group assesses that variable considerations involving unpriced 
variation orders are highly probably when it has a probability of at least 75% , that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue 
will not occur once the uncertainty related to the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The group recognizes variable 
considerations in unpriced variation orders in the following circumstances: 
Variation orders that have clear evidence available that the amounts meets the highly probable criterion are usually in (but not limited to) 
the following circumstances:
• The instruction or approval is documented. Amounts are expected to be based on costs or costs plus regular margin or contract rates
• Amounts covered by customer payments
• Amounts covered by documented settlement offers from the customer
Variation orders where the highly probably criterion is based on judgement are present in the following circumstances:
• Changes are without documented instruction of the client but the variation order is substantiated by other evidence such as advanced 
stage of negotiations. In some cases, the form of the contract entitles the Group to additional remuneration in case the work changes or 
additional work is required. 
• Additional project cost, on top off direct cost from variation orders (e.g. delays or redesign / adjustments)

Royal BAM Group nv113Integrated Report 2020
When variable considerations are constrained, the Group tries to resolve these with the customer first, otherwise with the help of 
third parties.
(c) Claims receivable
In the normal course of business the Group recognises contract assets in connection with claims for (partly) satisfied performance 
obligations due from the principal and/or insurance claims as reimbursement for certain loss events on projects. Claims for satisfied 
performance obligations are part of the variable considerations under IFRS 15. Project related claims on principals are recognised when it is 
highly probable that no significant reversal in the cumulative revenue recognised regarding to the claim, will occur. The Group considers 
both the likelihood and the magnitude of a possible revenue reversal. Factors that could increase the likelihood or the magnitude of a 
revenue reversal include, but are not limited to, any of the following: 
• the am
ount of consideration is highly susceptible to factors outside the entity’s influence. Those factors may include the judgement or 
actions of third parties like the court or an arbitration committee or weather conditions;
• the u
ncertainty about the amount of consideration is not expected to be resolved for a long period of time; 
• the e
ntity’s experience (or other evidence) with similar types of contracts is limited, or that experience (or other evidence) has limited 
predictive value;
• the e
ntity has a practice of either offering a broad range of price concessions or changing the payment terms and conditions of similar 
contracts in similar circumstances; 
• the con
tract has a large number and broad range of possible consideration amounts.
Insurance claims can be recognised only if it is virtually certain that the amount recognised will be reimbursed. See paragraph 2.26 for 
further explanation regarding the recognition of variable considerations.
(d) Income tax
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining the provision for income 
taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Group recognises liabilities 
for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters 
is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred tax assets and liabilities in 
the period in which such determination is made.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses carry-forwards, temporary differences and tax credits to the extent that the realisation of 
the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable. Estimates are an inherent part of this process and they may differ from 
the actual future outcome. Additional information is disclosed in note 24.
(e) Pension obligations
The present value of the pension obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of 
assumptions. The assumptions used in determining the net cost (income) for pensions include the discount rate. Any changes in these 
assumptions will impact the carrying amount of pension obligations.
The Group determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year. This is the interest rate that should be used to determine the 
present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the pension obligations. In determining the appropriate 
discount rate, the Group considers the interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds (AA) that are denominated in the currency in which 
the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension obligation.
Other key assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on current market conditions. Additional information is disclosed in note 22.
(f) Impairment of land and building rights and property development
The valuation of land and building rights and property development is based on the outcome of the related calculations of the land’s net 
realisable value. These calculations are based on assumptions relating to the future market developments, decisions of governmental 
bodies, interest rates and future cost and price increases. In most cases the Group uses external valuations (by rotation) to benchmark the 
net realisable value. Partly because estimates relate to projects with a duration varying from one year to more than thirty years, 
significant changes in these assumptions might result in an impairment. See note 13.
(g) Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-
use calculations. These calculations are determined using discounted cash flow projections and require estimates in connection with the 
future development of revenues, profit before tax margins and the determination of appropriate discount rates. An impairment loss is 
recognised if the carrying amount of an asset of CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. See note 9.

Page 114:
114Integrated Report 2020 Royal BAM Group nv
(h) Determining the lease term
The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend 
the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not 
to be exercised.
The Group has several lease contracts that include extension and termination options. The Group applies judgement in evaluating whether 
it is reasonably certain whether or not to exercise the option to renew or terminate the lease. That is, it considers all relevant factors that 
create an economic incentive for it to exercise either the renewal or termination. After the commencement date, the Group reassesses the 
lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise or not to 
exercise the option to renew or to terminate (e.g. changes in business strategy).
The Group included the renewal period as part of the lease term for leases when the renewal is reasonably certain to be exercised. 
Furthermore, the periods covered by termination options are included as part of the lease term only when they are reasonably certain not 
to be exercised. 
Leases regarding land and buildings mainly include office spaces and are leased for longer periods of time (10-25 years). Lease terms are 
negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The length of the period when certainty can 
be achieved, differs and is dependent on the contract negotiations with the lessor and the required office space. Usually, the Group is able 
to be reasonably certain if an option is exercised around two years before the lease term ends. 
The renewal options for leases of cars are not included as part of the lease term because the Group typically leases cars for not more than 
six years and, hence, is not exercising any renewal options. These cars are used both by office as project management employees.
Lease terms for equipment and installation may vary and are generally connected to the execution of projects or to housing in the offices 
buildings. The other leases are insignificant to the total leased asset portfolio.
See note 20. Lease liabilities for information on potential future rental payments relating to periods following the exercise date of extension 
and termination options that are not included in the lease term.

5 Segment information
The segment information reported to the Executive Board is measured in a manner consistent with the financial statements. The

In 2020, BAM received proceeds from a governmental institution to cease the asphalt production at a certain location. The production of 
asphalt was actually ceased by the end of 2020 and will no longer generate any economic benefit in future. BAM fulfilled its contractual 
obligations and recognised the proceeds in the income statement, together with the cost for reinstating the production site and the loss 
on derecognition of the underlying assets. 
In 2020, BAM and Heijmans nv (Heijmans) decided to combine their know-how, expertise and investments in the field of asphalt 
production in a newly formed joint venture, AsfaltNu cv. The joint venture, representing a new asphalt company, is equally owned by 
BAM and Heijmans. As a consequence, both BAM and Heijmans made an equal contribution in kind of their business (e.g. mainly asphalt 
plants) in this newly formed joint venture against a total fair value of €34 million as per 31 December 2020. The fair value of the joint 
venture amounts to €17 million as per 31 December 2020. See note 11.2. The corresponding carrying amount of the business 
contributed was €11 million. 
The total net gain of both transactions amounts amounts to €34 million and is included in the operating result in the consolidated 
income statement.
The operating results comprises impairment charges on goodwill of €21 million and €22 million relating to Construction and Property 
and Civil Engineering segment respectively. Both amounts are included in other. A goodwill impairment of €17 million form part of the 
operating result of Construction and Property and a goodwill charge of €1 million is included in Civil Engineering. In 2019, there were no 
impairment charges on goodwill. See note 9. Further, the operating result of Civil Engineering contains an amount of €0.6 million of 
impairment charges on property, plant and equipment (2019: nil). Total restructuring costs, as included in the respective segment 
disclosures, amount to €45 million of which €21 million (2019: €2 million) relate to construction and property, €22 million (2019: €3 
million) relate to civil engineering and €2 million to other (2019: nil).

Other revenue disclosures
The consideration received that was included in the project contract liability balance at the beginning of the period, has been fully 
recognised as revenue in the current year. Within the construction business, regular installments will take place but within the Group 
never leading to s
ignificant pre-financing longer than a year. 
The revenue recognised from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods amounts to €34 million (2019: €54 million). 
Performance obligations could be satisfied once the technical completion is final and control has been fully transferred to the client. It is 
common however to finalise the last pricing discussions regarding variable considerations, including claims, after control has been 
transferred. Due to the higher threshold to value variable considerations, claims that are settled for a higher amount than valued, might 
lead to revenue from previously satisfied performance obligations. 
Projects within the construction business often run for a period longer than one year, or might transfer from one calendar year to the 
other. The revenue expected related to unsatisfied performance obligations (running or won projects) are as follows:
(x € million) 
  
2020 2019
Up to 1 year 6,010 5,733
2 to 5 years 7,750 6,926
13,760 12,659
Over 5 years 2,134 1,583
Total 15,894 14,242
The Group has not used the practical expedient to exclude performance obligations in contracts with an original expected duration of 
one year or less. These are included in the above mentioned time buckets.

Goodwill acquired in business combinations is allocated, at acquisition date, to the cash-generating units (CGUs) or groups of CGUs 
expected to benefit from that business combination. The carrying amount of total goodwill is €319 million (2019: €380 million).
In 2020, BAM acquired an additional number of shares in a preconstruction entity up to 75 per cent of total shares, and obtained control. 
Previously the entity was qualified as an associate. The investment, which is currently a subsidiary, contributes to BAM’s local strategy to 
enlarge its footprint in the residential market. Consequently, BAM has fully consolidated the numbers of the entity in the consolidated 
financial statement. From the date of acquisition. The contribution of this entity to revenue and profit before tax from continuing 
operations for 2020 was not material (also no material contriution if it had been acquired as of the start of the year 2020. The goodwill of 
€7 million represents the difference between the consideration and the carrying amount of the net assets acquired. The Group 
performed a purchase price allocation which has not been fully finalised yet and the outcome shall be further reflected in 2021, once this 
exercise has been completed. This might give rise to certain changes in the amount of goodwill reported as per 31 December 2020, as 
the identifiable net assets assumed in this business combination will be measured at their fair value, based on the final outcome of this 
purchase price allocation.
The Group undertook an additional impairment review as per 30 June 2020 of key assumptions in estimating values in use of certain 
underlying CGUs to which goodwill is allocated. The review considered the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on overall macroeconomic 
outlook, the Group’s market segments and projected discount and growth rates as at the reporting date. While these model inputs, 
including forward-looking information, were revised overall, valuation methodology remained consistent with prior periods. Following 
these circumstances and the downturn in future expected cashflows as per 30 June 2020, the Company fully impaired the (remaining)

goodwill of BAM International (Civil engineering) of €22 million, BAM Germany (Construction and Property) of €12 million and BAM 
Contractors nv (Belgium) (Civil engineering) of €17 million and partly impaired the goodwill of Kairos nv (Belgium) (Construction and 
Property) for the amount of €9 million to €7 million. For the latter CGU no headroom remained as per 30 June 2020 the recoverable 
amount equals the remaining carrying amount.  See also note 28.
The remaining decrease of goodwill of €7 million fully relates to the change in exchange rate of the pound sterling.
CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indications that a particular CGU 
might be impaired. The recoverable amount of each CGU was determined based on value-in-use calculations. Value-in-use was determined using 
discounted cash flow projections that cover a period of five years and are based on the financial plans approved by management. The key 
assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding discount rate (WACC), revenue growth rate and profit before tax margin. The 
discount rate has been determined including the effects of IFRS 16, consistent with the other parameters of the impairment test, as this provided 
the most reliable manner of determining an appropriate discount rate using available market data.
The used base WACC to determine the value in use (recoverable amount) of goodwill is 7.6 per cent (31 December 2019: 7.9 per cent). Only for 
2020 the impact of IFRS16 has been included in the WACC. The WACC, revenue growth rate and profit before tax margin form crucial underlying 
assumptions for calculating the recoverable amount of each CGU. If and when these underlying assumptions would change in future, this could 
have significant impact on the CGU’s recoverable amount (based on value in use), which might give rise that the recoverable amount becomes 
lower than the carrying amount of the CGU to which goodwill is allocated.
Goodwill relates to 7 CGUs, of which BAM Construct UK €59 million (2019: €63 million) and BAM Nuttall €71 million (2019: €76 million) are 
deemed significant in comparison with the Group’s total carrying amount of goodwill. For each of these CGUs the key assumptions used in the 
value-in-use calculations are as follows: 
         BAM Construct UK          BAM Nut tall
2020 2019 2020 2019
Discount rate (post-tax) 8.3% 7.9% 8.3% 7.9%
Growth rate:
- In forecast period (average) 4.4% 0.5% 3.3% 1.8%
- Beyond forecast period 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0%
Profit before tax margin:
- In forecast period (average) 2.6% 2.2% 2.1% 2.3%
- Beyond forecast period 3.1% 2.4% 2.6% 2.4%
Growth rate used to estimate future performance in the forecast period is the average annual growth rate based on past performance 
and management’s expectations of BAM’s market development referenced to external sources of information, in which limited impact 
on Covid-19 has been taken in to account considering the current circumstances. The change in growth rate compared to 2019 in BAM 
Construct UK is due to a relatively low revenue base in 2020. BAM Nuttall shows a higher growth rate compared to 2019, due to 
additional projects which will materialise beyond 2020. The profit before tax margin in the forecast period is the average margin as a 
percentage of revenue based on past performance and the expected recovery to a normalised margin deemed achievable by 
management in the concerning market segment. The recoverable amounts for BAM Construct UK and BAM Nuttall exceed the carrying 
amounts of these CGUs with significant headroom.
The sensitivity analysis indicated that if the growth rate is reduced by 50 basis points, the profit before tax margin is reduced by 50 basis 
points or the discount rate is raised by 50 basis points in the forecast period, all changes taken in isolation, the recoverable amounts of 
the other CGUs would still be in excess of the carrying amounts with sufficient and reasonable headroom. Except for BAM’s CGUs BAM 
Contractors Ltd. and Kairos nv (representing a goodwill amount of €55 million) that have limited headroom a partial impairment of 
goodwill may arise. If the profit before tax margin is reduced by 50 basis points used in the value-in-use calculation for these CGUs at 
31 December 2020, the Group would have recognised an additional impairment of EUR 29 million. If the discount used in determining  
the value-in-use for these CGUs had been 50 basis points higher, the Group would have recognised an additional impairment against 
goodwill of EUR 8 million. If the growth rate would have reduced by 50 basis points, the Group would have recognised an additional 
impairments against goodwill of EUR 6 million.

The decrease in receivables in 2020 is mainly related to the derecognition of the PPP receivables following the transfer of 50 per cent of 
BAM PPP to PGGM. See 2.1.1. The remaining PPP receivables as per 31 December 2020, relates to PPP receivables of the Group (outside 
BAM PPP).
The average duration of the remaining receivables is 25 years (2019: 12 years). Approximately €9 million of the non-current part has a 
duration of more than five years (2019: €47 million).
The average interest rate on PPP receivables is 2 per cent (2019: 7 per cent). At year-end 2020, the fair value of the non-current part is 
considered to equal the carrying amount. 
 
11. Investments in associates and joint ventures
In 2020, due to the transfer of 50 per cent of the shares of BAM PPP to PGGM all assets and liabilities are derecognized of the former subsidiary 
from the consolidated statement of financial position per 31 December 2020.  See 2.1.1. As a consequence, the associate Infraspeed 
(Holdings) bv (10.54 per cent) and joint venture BAM PPP PGGM Infrastructure Coöperatie ua (50 per cent), directly owned by BAM PPP, have 
been derecognized as well. Only the comparative figures of the net assets sheet have been presented. The share in net result of these 
investments form part of discontinued operations (see note 37.3). The retained interest of 50 per cent by the Group in the former subsidiary 
BAM PPP has been qualified as a joint venture and recognised at its fair value of €117 million at initial recognition as per 31 December 2020, 
and shall be accounted for subsequently according to the equity method. See note 11.2.

On 3 March 2009, during the construction of a section of the Cologne metro system, several adjacent buildings, including the building of 
the City Archives of the City of Cologne, collapsed. Wayss & Freytag Ingenieurbau is a one-third partner in the consortium carrying out 
this project but was not directly involved in the work performed at the site of the accident. On 29 June 2020, the City of Cologne, 
Cologne Public Transport (KVB) and the joint venture (‘Arge’) that constructed a section of Cologne’s North/South metro line have 
reached an agreement to settle all outstanding claims with regard to this project, including damages caused by the collapse of the 
building of the City archives in 2009. Under the agreement, each joint venture partner has paid the City of Cologne €200 million, after 
which the parties will dismiss further claims against each other. A substantial part of Wayss & Freytag Ingenieurbau’s share is covered by 
insurance payments of €181 million fully received in 2020.  The Group has recognised a total charge of €36 million, included in the Share 
of result of investments in associates and joint ventures,  for the non-insured contribution of the settlement and for its share of cost for 
the completion of the project.
In 2020 the Group’s share in the net result of joint ventures included an impairment charge amounting to €1.9 million (2019: reversal 
€2.7 million).
Revenue of property development joint ventures amounts to €134 million (2019: €101 million) and property development recognised in 
the balance sheet amounts to €212 million (2019: €204 million) of which an amount of €85 million (2019: €91 million) externally financed 
(share of the Group).
Dividend received from joint ventures amounts to €16.2 million in 2020 (2019: €24.9 million).
The financial years of many joint ventures run from 1 December up to and including 30 November to ensure timely inclusion of the 
financial information in the Group’s financial statements.

Prepayments  85,513 97,028
 1,495,315 1,612,049
Trade and other receivables are due within one year, except for approximately €7 million (2019: €10 million). The fair value of this 
non-current part is approximately €7 million (2019: approximately €10 million) using an effective interest rate of 0.5 per cent negative 
(2019: 0.4 per cent negative).
The concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited, as the Group’s customer base is large and geographically 
spread. As at 31 December 2020 a part of the trade receivables amounting to €88 million (2019: €100 million) is past due over one year 
but partly impaired. These overdue receivables relate to a number of customers, predominantly in the public sector outside the 
Netherlands where a limited default risk exists. The duration to reach final agreement, including legal proceedings, on invoiced variation 
orders and claims with these customers remains long. Trade receivables are shown net of impairment losses which amount to €19 million 
(2019: €11 million) arising mainly from identified doubtful receivables from customers. Trade receivables were impaired taking into 
account the historical credit loss experience, adjusted forward looking factors of the debtors and the economic environment. See 
paragraph 2.12 regarding expected credit losses. Impairments of trade and other receivables in 2020 mainly related to disputed balances 
and final negotiations on these balances with the principal. No significant credit losses were identified.
The change in contract assets is due to normal activity in the construction business. Other changes as mentioned in IFRS 15 (paragraph 
118) are not relevant. 
Retentions relate to amounts retained by customers on progress billings. In the United Kingdom and Ireland in particular, it is common 
practice to retain a previously agreed percentage until completion of the project.
Amounts to be invoiced work completed and in progress represent the gross amounts expected to be collected for contract work 
performed to date but awaiting confirmation from customer before actual billing.

Exchange rate differences  (60) 60
As at 31 December  18,628 10,737
As of 31 December 2020, trade receivables of €19 million (31 December 2019: €11 million) were impaired and provided for, with a limited 
impact of Covid-19. The individually impaired trade receivables mainly relate to customers where limited default risk is in place. It was 
assessed that a portion of the receivables is expected to be recovered. The provision in respect of trade receivables is used to record 
impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied that no recovery of the amount owing is possible; at that point the amount considered 
irrecoverable is written off directly against the provision. Provision for impairment of receivables in 2020 mainly relate to disputed 
balances and final negotiations on these balances with the principal, which were significantly higher compared to last year. No significant 
credit losses were identified.
The creation and release of provisions for impaired receivables have been included in ‘Other operating expenses’ in the income 
statement.

16.1 General
At year-end 2020, the authorised capital of the Group was 400 million ordinary shares (2019: 400 million) and 600 million preference 
shares (2019: 600 million), all with a nominal value of €0.10 per share (2019: €0.10 per share). All issued shares have been paid in full (only 
ordinary shares).
The Company granted Stichting Aandelenbeheer BAM Groep (‘the Foundation’) a call option to acquire class B cumulative preference 
shares in the Company’s share capital on 17 May 1993. This option was granted up to such an amount as the Foundation might require, 
subject to a maximum of a nominal amount that would result in the total nominal amount of class B cumulative preference shares in 
issue and not held by the Company equalling no more than ninety-nine point nine per cent (99.9 per cent) of the nominal amount of the 
issued share capital in the form of shares other than class B cumulative preference shares and not held by the Company at the time of 
exercising of the right referred to above. The Executive Committee of the Foundation has the exclusive right to determine whether or 
not to exercise this right to acquire class B cumulative preference shares. Additional information has been disclosed in section Other 
information.
16.2 Ordinary shares
To prevent dilution as a result of the (equity-settled) share-based compensation plan introduced in 2015, the Company’s own shares

The legal reserves consist of hedging reserves and translation reserve. 
The reclassification in 2019 of the legal reserve amounts to €10.8 million and relates to amortisation and impairment of the patented 
Gravity Based Foundations for the offshore wind power sector. See note 9.
The negative movement in the translation reserve in 2020 is linked to the decrease in the value of the pound sterling.
During 2020 and previous to the transfer of 50 per cent of the shares to PGGM, the group reassessed its accounting for subordinated 
loans granted (and commitments thereto) to PPP projects in joint ventures, the majority of which are granted through the joint venture 
between BAM PPP and PGGM. The Group concluded that subordinated loans (and commitments thereto) provided to PPP projects in 
‘investments in associates or joint ventures’, should no longer be considered to form part of the net investment for the purpose of 
applying the equity method of accounting. This change has been accounted for prospectively and as a result, the cash flow hedge 
reserves recognised in equity changed by an amount of €86 million positive. The development of the interest rate had a negative effect 
of €33 million on the valuation of interest rate hedges in 2020. BAM transferred also 10 per cent of its tracking rights to PGGM in 2020, 
and €10 million (negative) was reclassified to the profit or loss.  The impact of alll aforementioned developments and transaction totally 

Page 138:
138Integrated Report 2020 Royal BAM Group nv
amounted to €63 million. Lastly, upon the transfer of 50 per cent of the shares to PGGM, as per 23 December 2020, the remaining 
amount of the cash flow hedge reserve under the reclassifications of EUR 32 million (negative) and part of the exchange rate differences 
of €5 million (negative) were reclassified from equity to profit or loss. See note 37.3.

Royal BAM Group nv139Integrated Report 2020
19.1 Non-recourse PPP loans
In 2020, non-recourse PPP loans, relating to PPP projects in the United Kingdom, were derecognised as a result
of the transfer by BAM of 50 per cent of the shares of BAM PPP to PGGM. This has been reflected in the disposals in the table 2020 above.
See 2.1.1 and note 37.3.
The remaining non-recourse PPP loans relate to real estate projects in the Netherlands. Of the non-current part, €1.4 million has a term 
to maturity of more than five years (2019: €2.4 million). The average term to maturity of the PPP loans is 11 years (2019: 1 year). The 
average interest rate on PPP loans is 2.0 per cent (2019: 4.0 per cent). Interest margins of these loans depend on market fluctuations 
during the term of these loans. 
19.2 Non-recourse property financing
These loans are contracted to finance land for property development and ongoing property development projects. The average term of 
non-recourse property financing is approximately 0.8 years (2019: approximately 1.7 years).
Interest on these loans is based on Euribor/EONIA plus a margin. Interest margins of these loans do not depend on market fluctuations 
during the term of these loans. For several property financing loans, the interest is (partially) fixed. The balance of these financing loans 
is nil (2019: €0.8 million).
The carrying amount of the related assets is approximately €164 million at year-end 2020 (2019: approximately €155 million). The assets 
are pledged as a security for lenders. These loans will be payable on demand if the agreed qualitative and quantitative conditions relating 
to interest and capital repayments, among other things, are not met.
19.3 Recourse property financing
Recourse property financing is contracted to finance land and building rights and property development. The average term of recourse 
property financing is approximately 1.7 years (2019: approximately 1.7 years). Interest on these loans is based on Euribor/EONIA plus a 
margin. Interest margins of these loans do not depend on market fluctuations during the term of these loans. For several property 
financing loans, the interest is (partially) fixed. The balance of these financing loans is €2 million (2019: €2 million).
Recourse property financing relates directly to the accompanying assets, that constitute a security for lenders. The carrying amount of 
the accompanying assets amounts to approximately €73 million at year-end 2020 (2019: approximately €135 million). Additional 
securities exist in the form of a guarantee provided by the Group, in some cases supplemented by a bank guarantee. These loans will be 
repayable on demand if the agreed qualitative and quantitative conditions relating to interest and capital repayments, among other 
things, are not met.
19.4 Subordinated convertible bonds
In June 2016, the Group placed €125 million subordinated unsecured convertible bonds. The bonds have an annual coupon of 3.50 per 
cent, an initial conversion premium of 32.5 per cent and are convertible into ordinary shares of Royal BAM Group nv with a nominal value 
of €0.10 each. The coupon is payable semi-annually in arrear in equal instalments on 13 June and 13 December. The Bonds were issued at 
100 per cent of their principal amount and, unless previously redeemed, converted or purchased and cancelled, the bonds will be 
redeemed at their principal amount on or around 13 June 2021. The Company is evaluating alternatives for refinancing the subordinated 
unsecured convertible bonds.
In 2020, the Group managed to buy back bonds with a notional value of €4.9 million in the open market. As per 31 December 2020, the 
subordinated convertible bonds amounting to €119 million form part of the short term borrowings. 
Upon exercise of their conversion rights, holders will receive shares at the then prevailing conversion price. At 31 December 2020
the conversion price remains at €4.8334 (31 December 2019: €4.8334). The Group has the option to call all but not some of the 
outstanding bonds at their principal amount plus accrued but unpaid interest since 28 June 2019, if the value of the shares underlying 
a bond exceeds €130,000 for a specified period of time. The bonds are trading on the Open Market (Freiverkehr) segment of the 
Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
All payment obligations to the bondholders are subordinated to the payment obligations towards our senior debt holders until the 
redemption date of 13 June 2021.

Page 140:
140Integrated Report 2020 Royal BAM Group nv
At 31 December 2020 the fair value of the liability component of the subordinated convertible bonds amounts to €120 million  
(31 December 2019: €124 million). The fair value is estimated by discounting future cash flows using a market rate for an equivalent 
non-convertible instrument.  
More details of the subordinated convertible bonds are published on the website.

19.5 Committed syndicated credit facility
In November 2016 the Group renewed its committed revolving credit facility agreement for an amount of €400 million. The facility 
agreement was extended with one year in 2018 and has a remaining term to maturity of 2.3 years and runs until 31 March 2023. 
On 24 April 2020, the committed revolving credit facility was extended with one year to 31 March 2024, whereas from 1 April 2023
the committed amount is €360 million.
The facility can be used for general corporate purposes, including the usual working capital financing. As a result of this flexible use, the 
level of draw-downs fluctuates throughout the year.
In March 2020, the Group fully drew the facility as a precautionary measure to address the extraordinary circumstances faced due to 
Covid-19. Variable interest rates apply to the draw-downs on this facility with a margin between 150 and 275 basis points. As at 31 
December 2020 the margin was 175 basis points (2019: 150 basis points). At year-end 2020, the facility was fully drawn (year-end 2019: 
not used). The revolving credit facility has been presented as a non-current liability as per 31 December 2020 given the contractual rights 
to repay the facility the latest at the end of the extended period of the revolving credit facility. 
19.6 Other financing
Other loans relate to financing of property, plant and equipment.
19.7 Bank overdrafts
Besides the non-current committed syndicated credit facility (note 19.5), the Group holds €138 million (2019: €138 million) in bilateral 
credit facilities and €25 million (2019: €25 million) intraday facilities. At year-end 2020 as well as 2019 the bilateral credit facilities and the 
intraday facilities were not utilised.

19.8 Covenants
With regard to the various finance arrangements, the Group is bound by terms and conditions, both qualitative and quantitative and 
including financial ratios, in line with the industry’s practice. 
Following the finance arrangement of the €400 million Revolving Credit Facility (RCF), the financial covenant calculation should be based 
on financial figures which are in line with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as applicable on the closing date 
(i.e. 29 November 2016). Under the documentation it is also agreed that changes in the IFRS standards after the closing date, can be 
reversed for covenant calculation purposes, often referred to as ‘frozen GAAP’.
Since the closing date of the RCF, IFRS 15 and 16 came into force. Initially BAM calculated the covenants on a frozen GAAP basis, but 
during 2019 BAM agreed with the lenders to update the financial documentation for both standards. The Group agreed to continue to 
reverse the initial IFRS 15 impact on transition date, however to be phased out to nil in six quarters starting from the third quarter of 
2019 onwards. With regard to IFRS 16, it has been agreed to leave all leases out of scope for covenant testing.
Terms and conditions for project financing, being (non-) recourse PPP loans, (non-) recourse property financing loans, are directly linked 
to the respective projects. A relevant ratio in property financing arrangements is the loan to value, i.e. the ratio between the financing 
arrangement and the value of the project. In PPP loans and recourse property financing arrangements the debt service cover ratio is 
applicable. This ratio relates the interest and repayment obligations to the project cash flow. No early payments were made in 2020 as a 
result of not adhering to the financing conditions of project related financing.
Terms and conditions for the committed syndicated credit facility are based on the Group as a whole, excluding non-recourse elements. 
The ratios for this financing arrangement (all recourse) are the leverage ratio, the interest cover, the solvency ratio and the guarantor 
covers. 
In March 2020, the Group fully drew the credit facility for €400 million as a precautionary measure to Covid-19. On 7 August 2020, BAM 
obtained a waiver from its lenders for the recourse leverage and recourse interest cover. The waiver is applicable with retrospective 
effect as of 30 June 2020 and applies for four quarters up to the period ending 31 March 2021. The waiver is accompanied with two 
temporary financial requirements applicable for four quarters as of 30 June 2020:
-  Consolidated net recourse borrowings:  ≤ €0); and
-  Recourse EBITDA (based on the last four quarters): ≥ -€25 million).
The Group has paid a waiver fee of 25 basis points. The margin increases by 25 basis points for these four quarters as long as Recourse 
EBITDA is not less than zero. If Recourse EBITDA is below zero the original margin grid is applicable and then the margin shall be 2.75 per 
cent per annum. Considering the waiver, the Group complied with all ratios in 2020. See also note 2.1.3.
An increased recourse leverage ratio of a maximum of 2.75 is permitted under the terms and conditions and applies to the second and 
third quarters of the year. The capital base in our financial covenants (as part of the solvency ratio) is adjusted for the hedging reserve 
and remeasurements of post-employments benefits, among other things.
The set requirements and realisation of the recourse ratios described above, can be explained as follows:
Calculation Requirement 2020 2019
Temporary requirements:
Recourse EBITDA ≥ -25 million 79 million
Recourse borrowings ≤ 0 million (1.3) billion
Leverage ratio Net borrowings/EBITDA ≤ 2.50 N/A (6.35)
Interest cover EBITDA/net interest expense ≥ 4.00 N/A 9.56
Solvency ratio Capital base/total assets ≥ 15% 20.3% 28.5%
Guarantor covers EBITDA share of guarantors ≥ 60% 107.8% 120%
Assets share of guarantors ≥ 70% 78.3% 90%

19.9 Other information
The Group’s subordinated convertible bonds, classified as borrowings under the current liabilities are part of the capital base. Repayment 
obligations are subordinated to not subordinated obligations. 
The non-recourse PPP loans relate directly to the associated receivables from government bodies. Therefore, the interest rates are 
influenced marginally by market adjustments applying to companies. The terms of property loans are relatively short, as a consequence 
of which interest margins are in line with the markets. Therefore, the carrying amounts of these loans do not differ significantly from 
their fair values. 
The effective interest rates (including hedging instruments) are as follows:

20. Lease liabilities 
The Group leases various land and buildings, equipment and installations, IT equipment, cars and other items from third parties under 
non-cancellable lease agreements. The lease agreements vary in duration, termination clauses and renewal options. The average 
incremental borrowing rate applied is 2.0 per cent as per 31 December 2020 (2019: 2.1 per cent).
See note 8. Right-of-use assets for the corresponding right-of-use assets.
Set out below are the carrying amounts of lease liabilities and the movements during the period:

Accretion of interest includes an amount of €0.02 million (2019: €0.02 million) relating to BAM PPP which is reported as discontinued 
operations in the consolidated income statement.
The undiscounted future lease payments as included in the lease liabilities, presented in time buckets, are as follows:
 2020  2019
Up to 1 year 87,142 90,400

303,983 326,675
In addition to the identified lease liabilities above, an amount of €30 million of lease commitments exist regarding the short-term leases (2019: 
€37 million). Given the applied practical expedient, these leases have not been included in the lease liabilities and are therefore not stated in 
the table above.
The Group has several lease contracts that include extension and termination options. These options are negotiated by management to 
provide flexibility in managing the leased-asset portfolio and align with the Group’s business needs. Management exercises significant 
judgement in determining whether these extension and termination options are reasonably certain to be exercised (see note 4).

21.1 Interest rate swaps
At year-end 2020, no interest rate swaps are outstanding to hedge the interest rate risk on the (non-) recourse PPP loans with a variable 
interest rate due to the deconsolidation of BAM PPP. Total borrowings amount to €929 million (2019: €583 million), of which an amount 
of €508 million (2019: €142 million) carries a variable interest rate. Of the borrowings with a variable interest rate an amount of €nil 
(2019: €40 million) is hedged by interest rate swaps. All interest rate swaps are classified as hedge instruments. The fair value of the 
outstanding interest rate swaps amounts to €nil (2019: €10 million negative). 
At year-end 2020, all derivative financial instruments of the Group provide an effective compensation for movements in cash flows from 
the hedged positions. Therefore, the movements in 2020 are accounted for in other comprehensive income. The change in fair value of 
outstanding derivative financial instruments which do not provide an effective compensation are accounted for in the income statement 
within ‘finance income/expense’.
The composition of the expected contractual cash flows is disclosed in note 3.1 to the consolidated financial statements.
21.2 Forward foreign exchange contracts
The notional principal amounts of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2020 were €62 million 
(2019: €241 million). The fair value amounts to €0.1 million negative (2019: €0.2 million negative).
The terms to maturity of these contracts are up to a maximum of one year for the amount of €54 million (2019: €238 million), between 
one and two years for the amount of €8.0 million (2019: €2.3 million) and between two to four years nil (2019:  €0.2 million).

22. Employee benefits
2020 2019
Defined benefit asset 55,107 68,929
Defined benefit liability 85,701 98,081
Other employee benefits obligations 28,031 30,139
113,732 128,220
The Group operates defined contribution plans in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Belgium, Germany and Ireland under broadly similar 
regulatory frameworks. The legacy defined benefit pension plans in all countries are closed for new entrants. The pension risks in the 
plans have decreased.
A further description of the post-employment benefit plans per country is as follows:
The Netherlands
In the Netherlands, the Group makes contributions to defined benefit schemes as well as defined contribution schemes.
The pension schemes in the Netherlands are subject to the regulations as stipulated in the Pension Act. Due to the Pension Act the pension 
plans need to be fully funded and need to be operated outside the Company through a separate legal entity. Several multi- employer funds 
and insurers operate the various pension plans. The Group has no additional responsibilities for the governance of these schemes.
The basic pension for every employee is covered by multi-employer funds in which also other companies participate based on legal 
obligations. These funds have an indexed average salary scheme and are therefore defined benefit schemes. Specifically, these are the 
industry pension funds for construction, metal & technology and railways. As these funds are not equipped to provide the required 
information on the Group’s proportionate share of pension liabilities and plan assets, the defined benefit plans are accounted for as defined 
contribution plans. The Group is obliged to pay the predetermined premium for these plans. The Group may not reclaim any excess 
payment and is not obliged to make up any deficit, except by way of the adjustment of future premiums. The part exceeding the basic 
pension amount (top-up part), which is not covered by multi-employer funds, is carried out by external parties and relates to defined 
contribution schemes.
At year-end 2020, the (twelve-month average) coverage rate of the industry pension fund for construction is 106 per cent (2019: 
112 per cent). The industry pension fund for metal & technology has a (twelve-month average) coverage rate of 91 per cent at year-end 
2020 (2019: 98 per cent). The (twelve-month average) coverage rate of the industry pension fund for railways is 102 per cent (2019:
108 per cent).
With effect from 2006, the defined benefit scheme is closed for new entrants. The build-up of future pension entitlements for these 
employees is covered by the multi-employer funds or external insurance companies. Defined benefit schemes are closed for future 
accumulation and index-linked to the industry pension fund for Construction. Future build-up is solely possible for the top-up pension 
scheme of BAM, is terminated in 2020; it is financed by the employer based on a percentage of the pensionable salaries of the 
employees.
In the context of accountability for the Group’s pension policy (to be) implemented, with regard to, inter alia, supplements and 
investment performance, the Group has established an accountability committee, with representation from the Central Works Council 
(CWC) and the Socio-Economic Committee of the BAM pensioners association (SEC).
United Kingdom
In the United Kingdom, the Group makes contributions to defined benefit plans as well as defined contribution plans. The Group is 
responsible for making supplementary contributions to recover the historical financing deficits. The plan for supplementary 
contributions was last revised after the most recent actuarial valuations of the funds in March 2016 and led to supplementary 
contributions in 2020 to the amount of approximately €4 million (2019: approximately €7 million). During 2019, the Group revalued the 
scheme’s assets and pension obligations with the support of the actuary experts. This revaluation led to an actuarial loss of €35 million, 
mainly caused by the buy-in insurance policy, decrease of discount rate and change in demographic assumptions. The loss is partly offset 
by €6 million tax impact. The Group recognises a net defined benefit asset because it is entitled to a return of surplus at the end of the 
plans’ lifes.

Royal BAM Group nv147Integrated Report 2020
The Group replaced the closed defined benefit pension schemes with defined contribution schemes, which are executed by an outside 
insurance company. Following the closure of future accumulation in defined benefit pension schemes in 2010, employees who 
participated in these schemes were invited to participate in the defined contribution schemes.
In addition, several defined benefit schemes are accounted for as defined contribution schemes due to the fact that external parties 
administering them are not able to provide the required information. These schemes have limited numbers of members. The Group is 
obliged to pay the predetermined premium for these plans. The Group may not reclaim any excess payment and is not obliged to make up 
any deficit, except by way of the adjustment of future premiums. The Group did not make any material contributions in 2020 nor 2019.
Belgium
In Belgium, the Group makes contributions to a relatively small defined benefit scheme that is executed by an external insurance 
company. The Group has also made arrangements for employees to participate in a defined contribution scheme.
Belgian defined contribution plans are subject to the Law of 28 April 2003 on occupational pensions, due to changes in the law in 
December 2015 defined contribution should be classified and accounted for as defined benefit plans under IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’.
Germany
In Germany, the Group operates one defined benefit pension scheme financed by the employer.
The Group closed two schemes to new participants and since 2006, the Group operates a defined contribution scheme, into which 
employees have the opportunity to contribute on an individual basis.
Ireland
The Group has a defined benefit scheme in Ireland, executed by a company pension fund. The multi-employer pension scheme was fully 
converted from a defined benefit scheme to a defined contribution scheme with effect from 1 January 2006 for new entrants.
The Group is responsible for making supplementary contributions to recover the historical financing deficits. The plan for supplementary 
contributions was last revised after the most recent actuarial valuations of the funds in 2017. This has led to a yearly supplementary 
contribution of approximately €2 million (2019: €2 million).

The significant actuarial assumptions per country were as follows:
Netherlands
United 
Kingdom Belgium Germany Ireland
2020
Discount rate 0.4% 1.4% 0.6% 1.0% 1.3%
Salary growth rate 0-1.7% 0-3.6% 1.7% 1.5% -

Salary growth rate 0-1.7% 0-3.6% 1.8% 1.5% -
Pension growth rate 0-1.4% 2.2-3.0% - 1.5% 0-1.3%
Assumptions regarding future mortality are set based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics and experience in 
each country.
The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is:
•  If th
e discount rate is 0.5 per cent higher (lower), the pension liability will decrease by approximately €148 million (increase by 
approximately €173 million).
•  If th
e expected salary increase is 0.5 per cent higher (lower), the pension liability will increase by approximately €2 million (decrease by 
approximately €2 million).
•  If th
e expected indexation is 0.5 per cent higher (lower), the pension liability will increase by approximately €85 million (decrease by 
approximately €73 million).
•  If th
e life expectancy increases (decreases) by 1 year, the pension liability will increase by approximately €78 million (decrease by 
approximately €77 million).
The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is 
unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit 
obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the 
projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised 
within the statement of financial position.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the previous period.

Plan assets do not include the Company’s ordinary shares. The Group applies IAS 19.115 for the valuation of the plan assets in connection 
with the insured contracts.
Through its defined benefit pension plans the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:
Asset volatility
The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if plan assets underperform this yield, 
this will create a deficit.
Changes in bond yields
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the 
plans’ bond holdings.
Salary growth
The plan liabilities are calculated based on future salaries of the plan participants, so increases in future salaries will result in an increase 
in the plan liabilities.
Pension growth
The majority of the plan liabilities are calculated based on future pension increases, so these increases will result in an increase in the plan 
liabilities.
Life expectancy
The majority of the plan liabilities are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an 
increase in the plan liabilities.
With regard to the funded plans, the Group ensures that the investment positions are managed within an asset-liability matching (‘ALM’) 
framework that has been developed to achieve long-term investments that are in line with the obligations under the pension schemes. 
Within this framework, the Group’s ALM objective is to match assets to the pension obligations by investing in long-term fixed interest 
securities with maturities that match the benefit payments as they fall due and in the appropriate currency. The Group monitors how the 
duration and the expected yield of the investments are matching the expected cash outflows arising from the pension obligations. The 
Group has not changed the processes used to manage its risks from previous periods. Investments are well diversified, such that the 
failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets. 
Employer contributions to post-employment benefit plans for the year ending 31 December 2021 are expected to be slightly lower than 
2020 by €3 million to €4 million, due to less contributions in the Netherlands and United Kindom.

The provision for warranty concerns the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle complaints and deficiencies that become 
apparent after the delivery of projects and that fall within the warranty period. In reaching its best estimate, the Group takes into 
account the risks and uncertainties that surround the underlying events which are assessed periodically. Approximately 47 per cent of 
the provision is current in nature (2019: approximately 69 per cent). 
The provision for restructuring concerns the best estimate of the expenditure associated with reorganisation plans already initiated. This 
provision has significantly increased due the major restructuring programme, announced in September 2020,  of which costs nearly fully 
relate to headcount reductions. Further, due to the wind down of activities in BAM International a number of employees have been made 
redundant in 2020. Total restructuring costs related to the major restructuring programme as well as the wind down of BAM 
International amount to approximately €45 million for which the majority is expected to be settled in 2021. Approximately 99 per cent of 
the provision is current in nature (2019: approximately 69 per cent). The estimated staff restructuring costs to be incurred are recognised 
under ‘personnel expenses’ for an amount of €41 million (2019: €3 million). Other direct costs attributable to the restructuring are 
recognised under ‘other operating expenses’. The reclassifications under restructuring comprise amounts reclassified to other liabilities.
Claims and legal obligations mainly relate to legal cases of closed projects. These are related to active and at-risk cases. The uncertainties 
related to this provision are linked to the duration and the extent of the amount to be incurred.  Approximately 64 per cent of the 
provision is current in nature (2019: 57 per cent).
The provision for associates and joint ventures arise from the legal or constructive obligation in connection with structured entities for 
property development projects (associates and joint ventures). An amount of €39.4 million (2019: €77.5 million) is attributable to joint 
ventures and €0.0 million (2019: €0.0 million) to associates. Reclassifications of Associates and joint ventures mainly relate to the 
derecognition of all assets and liabilities of BAM PPP following the transfer of 50 per cent of the shares to PGGM. See 2.1.1 and note 11.2. 
A provision for onerous contracts is related to projects for which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract 
exceed the economic benefits. Appr. 63 per cent of the provision is current in nature (2019: appr. 58 per cent). See note 2.26 step 2.
Other provisions relate to various individual immaterial amounts and nature, such as decommissioning obligations and minor disputes. 
Approximately 79 per cent of the provision is current in nature (2019: approximately 59 per cent). The additional provisions of Other include 
an amount of €10 million that relates to a subsidiary that has been classified as held for sale as per 31 December 2020. See note 37.2.
The provisions in the transfer to liabilities held for sale of €3 million relate to this subsidiary. 
The non-current part of the provisions has been discounted at an interest rate in the range of approximately 0 to 3 per cent  
(2019: approximately 0 to 3 per cent).

Deferred tax assets in a country are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits in that country are 
available against which the deductible temporary differences, available tax credits and available tax losses carry-forwards can be utilised. 
The assessment as to whether an entity will have sufficient taxable profits in the future is a matter requiring careful judgement based on 
the facts and circumstances available. Although the profit forecast shows that sufficient profit should be available in coming years to 
recognize a deferred tax asset for compensating losses, we performed further analysis of all positive and negative evidence to 
substantiate the position taken. The nature of the convincing evidence did not change significantly compared to 31 December 2019, 
except for the future taxable profits. The Group’s actual results for the year, and the forecasted taxable profits for the years 2021 
through 2026 have been seriously affected by underperformance of the German construction, BAM International and Dutch Civil 
engineering business, the decision to wind down BAM International and the fact that BAM’s interest in BAM PPP was reduced to 50%. 
Also, the Group has considered the impact of Covid-19 in the estimates used for the valuation of the deferred tax assets. As a 
consequence, deferred tax assets for net operating losses were impaired for an amount of €69 million, of which €44.2 million relate to 
the Netherlands and € 20.6 million to Germany. The remaining carrying amount (after impairment and recognition of net operating 
losses) of the deferred tax asset is €92.6 million as at 31 December 2020.
Netherlands
Tax losses available to the fiscal unity in the Netherlands for carry-forward losses at year-end 2020 amount to approximately €636 million 
(2019: €1 billion). These unused tax losses relate to the years 2012 up to and including 2017 and result to a large extent from identifiable 
causes, which are unlikely to recur, including significant impairments on properties and significant restructuring costs during these 
years. The legal term within which these losses may be offset against future profits is nine or six years. 
Based on estimates and timing of future taxable profits within the fiscal unity in the Netherlands for the upcoming six years, 
approximately €256 million (2019: €470 million) of these losses are recognised. Management estimates of forecasted taxable profits in 
the Netherlands are based on financial budgets approved by management, extrapolated using growth rates for revenue and profit 
before tax margins that take into account external market data and benchmark information and taking into account past performance. 
Growth rates for revenue and profit before tax margins are in line with the Group’s mid- and long-term expectations. Subsequently these 
forecasts have been reduced to meet the recognition criteria under IFRS in respect of deferred tax assets. No specific tax planning 
opportunities have been taken into account. The measurement of the deferred tax asset is especially sensitive to the risk of expiry of tax 
loss carry forwards, for which therefore appropriate discounts have been used.
In December 2019 the Dutch tax plan 2020 was approved by the Dutch Senate increasing the corporate income tax rate to 25 per cent in 
2020 and decreasing to 21.7 per cent in 2021 and future years. The impact of the tax rate decrease has been reflected in the value of the 
deferred tax assets in the 2019 annual report. In December 2020, the Dutch Senate accepted the Dutch tax plan 2021 which makes the 
tax plan substantially enacted under IFRS. In the Dutch tax plan 2021 the future reduction of the income tax rate to 21.7% will not be 
further implemented and the income tax rate will remain at 25%. This resulted in an increase in deferred tax asset relating to operating 
losses by €8 million.

Not substantially enacted is the proposed change in tax loss carry forward rules which should be effective as from 2022. Tax losses can 
be used unlimited in time (before this, tax losses could only be used in the following six or nine years). However, annual use of tax losses 
is limited to 50 per cent of the taxable profit wherein the first €1 million taxable profit is fully compensable (previously, the total profit in 
a year could be offset by tax losses). Enactment of the new tax rules is expected in 2021. Since the new legislation in the Netherlands has 
not been fully enacted as per 31 December 2020, the possible effects hereof have not been accounted for as per 31 December 2020. 
When using the estimates and forecast period as applied in the valuation as per 31 December 2020 an impairment of €28 million 
regarding the deferred tax assets would occur. When substantially enacted in 2021 the actual impact will be further analysed.
Germany
Tax losses to a minimum of €677 million (2019: €600 million) are expected to remain available for the companies in Germany, which can 
be offset against future taxable profits. Based on estimates of the level and timing of future taxable profits per operating company and 
per fiscal unity, approximately €6 million (2019: €15 million) of these losses are recognized. The legal term within which these losses may 
be offset against future profits is indefinite. Management estimates of forecasted taxable profits in Germany are based on financial 
budgets approved by management, extrapolated using estimated growth rates that are considered to be in line with the Group’s 
mid- and long-term expectations, taking into account past performance.

In response to Covid-19, the Group made use of the temporary deferral of tax payments (value added tax and wage tax) granted by 
certain tax authorities for a total nominal amount of €234 million, of which is mainly related to the Netherlands and partly to the United 
Kingdom. An amount of €50 million has been included in the social security and other taxes and the long term part amounting to 
€184 million, which is to be settled after 2021 up to 2024, forms part of the social security and other taxes in the non-current liabilities 
in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The increase in amounts due to customers (contract liabilities) mainly relates to some large prepayments on certain contracts. 
The amounts due for work completed and for work in progress relate to suppliers of the Group for contract work performed.

which €35  million is included in wages and salaries, €4 million in social security costs and €1 million in pension costs and other 
post-employment benefits. See further note 28. 
Certain governmental (furlough) schemes were used in connection with Covid-19 for a total amount of approximately €12 million, which 
is fully reflected in wages and salaries. An amount of €10 million in respect of the United Kingdom (€8 million) and Ireland (€2 million) 
has been received and is deducted from wages and salaries. The remainder of  €2 million is reflected as a reduction of the wages and 
salaries as part of the employee benefit expenses, given the fact that grants in Belgium were directly paid to employees. See note 41.
At year-end 2020, the Group had 17,966  employees in FTE (2019: 19,419, excluding 98 in discontinued operations). The average number 
of employees in FTE amounted to 18,731 (2019: 19,336, excluding discontinued operations), of which 10,185 in other countries than the 
Netherlands (2019: 10,966).

Deteriorating market conditions (including Covid-19) gave rise to further assess future performance of the Group. Poor performance of certain 
underlying CGUs (to which goodwill is allocated) led to an impairment loss of goodwill of €61 million. See note 9.
In 2020 and 2019, the net impairment charges in connection with inventories are related to property developments in the Netherlands.

28.   Adjusted items 
The following items have been adjusted on the result before tax and relate to impairment charges, restructuring costs and pension 
one-offs as detailed below:
Notes 2020 2019
Impairment charges 27 74,741 18,523
Restructuring costs 23 44,676 4,957
Pension one-off 22 (1,181) -
118,236 23,480
Impairment charges
Impairment charges mainly relate to impairment of goodwill in 2020. Also certain property development has been impaired for the net 
amount of  €11 million which have been reported at their net realisable value.
Restructuring costs
Restructuring costs relate to the major restructuring programme, announced in September 2020. Further, due to the wind down of 
activities in BAM International a number of employees have been made redundant in 2020. Total restructuring costs related to the major 
restructuring programme as well as the wind down of BAM International amount to approximately €45 million (2019: €5 million) of 
which €41 million (2019: €3 million) is included in employee benefit expenses and €4 million (2019: €2 million) is included in other 
operating expenses. 
Pension one-off
The pension one-off relates to the UK Civil release of pension liability due to a change of indexation of future salary increases, which had 
a positive effect of €1.2 million.

31. Income tax
2020 2019
Current tax (533) 20,226
Deferred tax 35,633 16,489
35,100 36.715
Income tax on the Group’s result before tax differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the weighted average tax rate 
applicable to profits of the consolidated companies as follows:
2020 2019
Result before tax (236,947) 23,389
Tax calculated at Dutch tax rate (59,237) 5,848
Tax effects of:
- Tax rates in other countries 20,833 892
- Non deductible goodwill impairment 15,000 -
- Income not subject to tax - 37
- Remeasurement of deferred tax – changes in enacted tax rates (7,420) (5,570)
- Tax filings and previously unrecognised temporary differences - 5,056
- Previously unrecognised tax losses (920) (9,709)
- Tax losses no(t) (longer) recognised 69,061 36,657
- Results of investments and other participations, net of tax (1,566) (3,491)
- Other including expenses not deductible for tax purposes (651) 6,995
Tax charge/(gain) 35,100 36,715
Effective tax rate  -14.8% 76,4%
The weighted average tax rate applicable was 16.2 per cent (2019: 25.9 per cent). The difference with the effective tax rate is attributable 
to a different spread of results over the countries. 
In 2020 the tax burden was influenced by tax losses which are not recognised (anymore), non-deductible goodwill impairment, non-
taxable participation related results and the increase of the corporate tax rates in the Netherlands.
On balance the corporate income tax rate effect in the Netherlands and UK has an positive impact on the deferred tax positions of the 
group for €7.4 million, of which €9.4 million relates to losses and credits within the Dutch fiscal unity. An amount of €69 million of the 
tax charge relates to the derecognition of deferred tax assets, of which €44.2.million relates to the impairment of tax losses of the Dutch 
fiscal unity. Furthermore, the lower than expected performance of the German construction and property unit led to a derecognition of 
deferred tax assets of in total €20.6 million.
Next to that the goodwill impairment reported is not deductible for taxes, negatively impacting the effective tax rate by € 15 million.
For information about the income tax expenses in respect of discontinued operations see note 37.3.

32. Earnings per share  
2020 2019
Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue (x 1,000) 273,296 273,496
Net result attributable to shareholders (122,184) 11,846
Basic earnings per share (in €) (0.45) 0.04
Net result from continuing operations attributable to shareholders (271,760) (13,310)
Basic earnings per share from continuing operations (in €) (1.00) (0.05)
Net result from discontinued operations attributable to shareholders 149,577 25,156
Basic earnings per share from discontinued operations (in €) 0.55 0.09
Allowing for dilution, the earnings per share are as follows:
2020 2019
Diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue (x 1,000) 299,124 299,039
Net result attributable to shareholders (diluted) (116,659) 17,238
Diluted earnings per share (in €) (0.45) 0.04
Net result from continuing operations attributable to shareholders (diluted) (266,236) (7,918)
Diluted earnings from continuing operations per share (in €) (1.00) (0.05)
Net result from discontinued operations attributable to shareholders (diluted) 149,577  25,156 
Diluted earnings from discontinued operations per share (in €) 0.55  0.09 
In 2020 and 2019, the potential ordinary shares are antidilutive because their conversion to ordinary shares would decrease the loss per 
share from continuing operations. Therefore in both years, no conversion is assumed and the diluted earnings per share are equal to the 
basic earnings per share.
33. Dividends per share and proposed appropriation of result
The net result for 2020, amounting to a loss of €122.4 million, has been accounted for in shareholders’ equity.
The Company proposed to declare a dividend over the financial year 2019 of 2 eurocents in cash per ordinary share or in shares, at the 
option of the shareholders with repurchase of shares to offset dilution. This proposed dividend was further withdrawn in 2020.
 Over 2020, no dividend is proposed to be declared in light of Covid-19 circumstance which severely affected the group’s performance.
The dividends paid to shareholders of ordinary shares in 2019 were €38.3 million, €19.5 million in cash (€0.14 per share) and €18.8 million 
in shares (€0.14 per share), these shares were repurchased in 2019 for €16.9 million.

34. Contingencies
34.1 Legal proceedings
In the normal course of business the Group is involved in legal proceedings predominantly concerning litigation in connection with 
(completed) construction contracts. The legal proceedings, whether pending, threatened or unasserted, if decided adversely or settled, 
may have a material impact on the Group’s financial position, operational result or cash flows. The Group may enter into discussions 
regarding settlement of these and other proceedings and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best 
interests of the Company’s shareholders. In accordance with current accounting policies, the Group has recognised provisions with 
respect to these proceedings, where appropriate, which are reflected on its balance sheet. 
On 3 March 2009, during the construction of a section of the Cologne metro system, several adjacent buildings, including the building of 
the City Archives of the City of Cologne, collapsed. In 2020, the City of Cologne, Cologne Public Transport and the joint venture (‘Arge’) 
reached an agreement to settle all outstanding claims in regards to this project. See note 11.2.
34.2 Guarantees
Bonds and Guarantees are provided in the ordinary course of business to our clients, either by the Company (parental guarantees), by 
banks (bank guarantees), or by surety companies (surety bonds), securing due performance of the obligations under the contracts by the 
subsidiaries of the Company.
It is not expected that any material risks will arise from these securities. These securities are limited in amount and can only be called 
upon in case of (proven) default.
The parent company guarantees issued amount to €186 million (2019: €178 million). Guarantees issued by banks and surety companies 
amount to €2 billion (2019: €2 billion). Guarantee facilities amount to €2.9 billion (2019: €3.2 billion).

35. Commitments
35.1 Purchase commitments
Capital expenditure contracted for at the end of the reporting period but not yet incurred and conditional contractual obligations to 
purchase land for property development activities is as follows:
2020 2019
Property, plant and equipment 2,733 6,288
Land 154,047 203,291
156,780 209,579
The conditional nature of the contractual obligations to purchase land relate to, among other items, the amendment of development 
plans, the acquirement of planning permissions and the actual completion of property development projects.
35.2 Lease commitments
The future undiscounted lease payments regarding lease commitments are included in note  20. Lease liabilities. 
The Group has various lease contracts that have not yet commenced as at 31 December 2020. The future undiscounted lease payments 
for these non-cancellable lease contracts are €1.7 million within one year, €4.9 million within five years and €0.2 million thereafter (2019: 
€3.3 million within one year, €12.4 million within five years and €1.2 million thereafter).
 
The G
roup has variable lease payments amounting to €34.5 million which are not recognised in lease liabilities, but are recognised as 
expense in profit and loss. The expected future costs related to these variable lease payments are €11.9 million within one year, 
€21.3 million within five years and €1.3 million thereafter. Variable leases mainly relate to fuel costs which is based on usage (2019: 
€14.4 million within one year, €36.8 million within five years and €2.9 million thereafter). The variability of these costs depend on the 
number of vehicles driven, their actual usage and any changes in rates.
36. Brexit
On 31 December 2020, the transition period for the United Kingdom (U.K.) to withdraw from the European Union (EU), otherwise known 
as “Brexit,” officially came to an end. The U.K. formally left the EU on 31 January 2020, but entered a transition process that ended on 
31 December 2020. The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement was agreed to on 24 December 2020 and signed on 30 December 
2020. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement has three main pillars: trade, cooperation, and governance that took effect on 1 January 
2021. BAM has performed an financial impact analysis on the impact of this new agreement from a contract, supply chain, trade tariffs 
and customs, regulation and people perspective. BAM concluded that no major impact of Brexit is to be expected so far but continues to 
closely monitor the effects of Brexit.
37. Assets held for sale and discontinued operations
37.1 Assets held for sale inventories
2020 2019
Inventories 7,819 8,516 
Assets classified as held for sale 7,819 8,516 
At year-end 2020 and 2019, the assets classified as held for sale relate to inventories compromising of one remaining property 
development position in the East part of the Netherlands, which are not yet transferred. Part of the inventories have been sold in 2020.

Royal BAM Group nv163Integrated Report 2020
The remaining carrying amount which represents the fair value is based on the sale price agreed upon. The unanticipated delay in the 
planned sale was caused by circumstances beyond the control of the company (i.e Covid-19, new regulations regarding nitrogen 
emissions and dependency on external parties). BAM closely monitors the progress of the planned sale and still considers it is highly 
probable that the property development position will be sold within one year. 
37.2 Assets held for sale BAM Swiss AG 
In 2020, BAM decided to analyse the possibilities for divesting its subsidiary BAM Swiss AG in Switzerland. Late 2020, BAM had several 
discussions and negotiations with certain interested parties. BAM considers that, given the stage of the negotiations, it is probable that 
the entity will be sold in 2021. Accordingly, all its assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale in the consolidated statement of 
financial position as at 31 December 2020. Early February 2021, BAM agreed on a non-binding basis the key terms of a transaction with a 
certain party. Under these terms, BAM aims to pay a net amount of approximately €12 million to transfer all shares to the buyer. Since 
the carrying amount of the non-current assets is limited and the transaction would result in a loss on sale, BAM recognised  a provision of 
approximately €10 million, via the other operating expenses, in the financial statement of financial position.
At 31 December 2020 the assets and liabilities relating to BAM Swiss AG classified as held for sale are as follows:
31 December
2020
Trade and other receivables 13,187
Cash and cash equivalents 6,231
Assets classified as held for sale 19,418
Trade and other payables 18,138
Current provisions 2,629
Liabilities classified as held for sale 20,768
37.3 Discontinued operations of BAM PPP 
As a first step in the partnership extension between PGGM and BAM PPP (see 2.1.1) the Group transferred 10 per cent of its invested 
capital (share capital and subordinated loans invested through the joint venture) in 21 projects to PGGM, reducing BAM’s interest in 
these projects from 20 per cent to 10 per cent. The cash consideration associated with this transaction amounted to €39 million, 
resulting in a net profit of €14 million which forms part of revenue. The impact on total equity was €24 million and includes an
amount of €10 million negative of cash flow hedge reserves, that were reclassified to the income statement. See also note 17. 
On 23 November 2020, the Group and PGGM publicly announced to further extent their PPP partnership by transferring 50 per cent of 
the common shares of BAM PPP, until then a wholly owned subsidiary, to PGGM Infrastructure Fund. The transaction was completed on 
23 December 2020. As a consequence, BAM lost control of this subsidiary and derecognized all the assets and liabilities of BAM PPP from 
the statement of financial position. The retained interest in BAM PPP, which is qualified as a joint venture for BAM, has been recognised 
at its fair value and amounts to €117 million as at 31 December 2020. See note 11.2. 
The results of BAM PPP are reported as discontinued operation and are presented separately in the consolidated income statement. The 
2019 consolidated income statement has been adjusted for comparative purposes.
The sales price for the transfer of the shares comprises a cash consideration, received in 2020, of €110 million that includes €5 million as 
a reimbursement for 50 per cent of the initial capitalization of the joint venture of €10 million. A working capital adjustment, which 
forms part of the sales price but settled in 2021, is included in other receivables and amounts to €5 million. In addition, the parties 
agreed to a Contingent Consideration of up to €25 million for the years 2021-2025. The contingent consideration will become payable if 
and when the secured equity commitments will exceed a certain threshold over a period of five years with a cap of €5 million for each 
and every year. Given the assumed threshold along with the past level of secured equity, the fair value of the contingent consideration is 
estimated at €2 million and forms part of the long term receivables as at 31 December 2020. The fair value of the contingent 
consideration shall be reassessed at each reporting date. 
The total sales price, therefore, amounts to €117 million and has been considered as an appropriate approximation of the fair value of the 
joint venture at initial recognition as per 31 December 2020.

Page 164:
164Integrated Report 2020 Royal BAM Group nv
Lastly, the group shall receive a further amount of circa €2 million from the joint venture in 2021 that mainly relates to an excess of cash 
above the initial capitalization of €10 million that was agreed upon by both parties. This amount shall be distributed in 2021 and forms 
part of the gain of this transaction. The net asset value of BAM PPP, of which cash and cash equivalents of €28 million, upon the transfer 
of the shares amounts to €81 million.
The gain on this transaction, before the reclassification of reserves on cash flow hedging and exchange rate differences, amounts to 
€155 million. Fifty per cent of this gain accounts for a ‘fair value step up’ on the remaining interest in the former subsidiary from its 
carrying amount to fair value. This step up shall systematically be allocated as costs to the future Group’s share of the profit and losses of 
the entity. The reserves involved are reclassified to the profit or loss for the amount €32 million (negative) and €5 million (negative) 
respectively and are attributed to the transaction resulting in a total gain of this transaction of €118 million. There is no income tax on 
this gain.
The result for the year from discontinued operations can be detailed as follows:
2020 2019
Revenue 52,732 45,136
Operating result* 26,389 17,715
Finance result 8,486 9,513
Result before tax 34,875 27,228
Tax benefit/(expense) (3,387) (1,935)
Total 31,488 25,293
Gain on the transaction* 118,167 -
Result for the year from discontinued operations 149,655 25,293
Non-controlling interest (78) (137)
Net result for the year from discontinued operations attributable to the shareholders of the Company 149,577 25,156
* Forms part of the total operating result in the disclosure on operating segments. The total result before tax of the discontinued operations amounts to 
€1
53,042 thousand and comprises the result before tax of €34,875 thousand and the gain on the transaction of €118,167 thousand. In 2020 the operating 
result from discontinued operations amounts to €144,556 thousand that comprises €26,389 thousand plus €118,167 thousand. See note 5.
The other comprehensive income includes cash flow hedges and cash flow hedges of investments in joint ventures for a total amount of 
€95 million positive (2019: €30 million negative), which is disclosed below. The exchange rate differences amounts to €3 million positive 
(2019: €2 million positive). During 2020 and previous to the transfer of 50 per cent of the shares to PGGM, the group reassessed its 
accounting for subordinated loans granted (and commitments thereto) to PPP projects in joint ventures, the majority of which are 
granted through the joint venture between BAM PPP and PGGM. The Group concluded that subordinated loans (and commitments 
thereto) provided to PPP projects in ‘investments in associates or joint ventures’, should no longer be considered to form part of the net 
investment for the purpose of applying the equity method of accounting. This change in judgement has been accounted for 
prospectively and as a result, the cash flow hedge reserves recognised in equity changed by an amount of €86 million positive. The 
development of the interest rate had a negative effect of €33 million on the valuation of interest rate hedges in 2020. BAM transferred 
also 10 per cent of its tracking rights to PGGM in 2020, and €10 million (negative) was reclassified to the profit or loss. Lastly, upon the 
transfer of 50 per cent of the shares to PGGM, effectively as per 31 December 2020, the remaining amount of the cash flow hedge 
reserve of €32 million (negative) is reclassified from equity to profit or loss. Therefore, the total fair value movement of cashflow hedges 
totally amounts to €95 million (positive). Also, the movement in exchange rate differences of BAM PPP amounts to €3 million (positive). 
Total comprehensive income from discontinued operations amounts to €248 million, comprising of the net result from discontinued 
operations of €150 million and other comprehensive income of €98 million.
The net cash flows incurred by BAM PPP (excluding the cash consideration), are as follows:
2020 2019
Operating 7,037 30,163
Investing 54,682 (7,215)
Financing (99,825) (23,539)
Net cash (outflow) / inflow (38,106) (591)
The total cash consideration received in 2020 amounts to €110 million. The total proceeds from sale of discontinued operations amounts

38. Related parties
The Group identifies subsidiaries, associates, joint arrangements, third parties executing the Group’s defined benefit pension plans and 
key management as related parties. Transactions with related parties are conducted at arm’s length, on terms comparable to those for 
transactions with third parties.
The following transactions were carried out with related parties:
38.1 Sales and purchase of goods and services
A major part of the Group’s activities is carried out in joint arrangements. These activities include the assignment and/or financing of 
land as well as carrying out construction contracts. 
The Group carried out transactions with associates and joint arrangements related to the sale of goods and services for €369.4 million 
(2019: €410.1 million) and related to the purchase of goods and services for €6.8 million (2019: €11.2 million).

loans there are no fixed terms for the repayment of loans between the parties. Interests for these loans are at arm’s length. Loans to 
related parties are included in ‘Other financial assets’ in the statement of financial position. 
In 2020, loans granted by BAM PPP for the amount of €34 million, were derecognised as a result of the transfer by BAM of 50 per cent of 
the shares of BAM PPP to PGGM.

The short-term incentive (‘STI’) is part of the remuneration package of the Executive Board and is based on financial objectives (70 per cent) 
and non-financial objectives (30 per cent). At the beginning of each financial year, the Supervisory Board determines the financial and 
non-financial STI objectives, their relative weighting and the performance incentive zones (i.e. threshold, at target and excellent performance 
levels). Payout gradually increases with performance, starting with a payout of 35 per cent of the fixed annual remuneration at threshold 
performance, 55 per cent at target performance and potentially going up to 75 per cent when performance is excellent. Below threshold there 
will be zero payout. The Supervisory Board determined the payout for 2020 at 32.3 per cent (2019: 32.8 per cent).
Post-employment benefits relate to the pension costs of the defined benefit plans recognized in the income statement and, if no pension 
arrangements were made, paid contributions for personal pension arrangements. Cost of defined benefit plans are determined on the 
basis of the individual pension obligations. Interest results and return on plan assets are not allocated on an individual basis. Certain 
components of the post-employment benefits are conditional and paid if employment continues until the retirement age.
The actual and necessarily incurred costs in the performance of the duties for the Group are reimbursed.
The long-term incentive relates to the Performance Share Plan. Additional information is disclosed in note 39.
No share options have been awarded to the members of the Executive Board. No loans or advances have been granted to the members 
of the Executive Board. Per 31 December 2020, Mr Joosten held 0 BAM shares and Mr Den Houter held 25,000 privately acquired BAM 
shares.

39. Share-based payments
In 2020, BAM’s long-term incentive plan consisted of a conditional share-based incentive plan called Performance Share Plan. Under the 
Performance Share Plan, each year performance shares are conditionally awarded subject to performance over a vesting period of three financial 
years. The number of awarded performance shares is calculated by dividing the award value (expressed as a percentage of fixed remuneration) 
by the average closing price of the BAM share on Euronext Amsterdam on the five days after the General Meeting in the year of award. 
Performance is based on two financial objectives, being relative total shareholder return (TSR) and return on capital employed (ROCE) 
and one non-financial objective, being sustainability. TSR is defined as the share price increase, including dividends and measured over a 
three year period based on the three month average share price before the start and the end of the three year performance period. The 
relative position within the peer group determines the vesting percentage. The TSR peer group comprises of Balfour Beatty, Boskalis, 
Eiffage, Heijmans, Hochtief, NCC, Skanska, Strabag, Vinci, PORR (and BAM). At the beginning of each financial year, based upon a 
proposal from the Remuneration Committee, the Supervisory Board determines the performance incentive zones (i.e. threshold, at 
target and excellent performance levels) for ROCE and sustainability.
After the three year performance period, the Supervisory Board will assess the extent to which the performance objectives have been 
achieved. This results in a vesting percentage for each of the three performance objectives, each determining one third of the vesting of 
the conditionally awarded performance shares. For excellent performance, the number of performance shares that vests may amount to 
a maximum of 150 per cent of the ‘at target’ number of performance shares. This percentage may be reduced to 50 per cent (on a sliding 
scale) for threshold performance and to 0 below that. The TSR objective will also operate as a ‘circuit breaker’ for the vesting linked to 
the other two performance objectives: in case BAM ranks at the bottom two places of the TSR peer group, the other two objectives will 
not result in vesting regardless of the performance.

Page 168:
168Integrated Report 2020 Royal BAM Group nv
The value of the performance shares – as the combined result of the number of performance shares that will vest and the share price at 
the moment of vesting – that will become unconditional to a participant will at vesting never exceed two and a half times the award value 
in order to avoid inappropriate payouts.
The three-year vesting period will be followed by a two-year lock-up period. In addition, there is a minimum share ownership requirement. 
Executive Board members are not allowed to divest any shareholding until the two-year lock-up period has lapsed and the minimum share 
ownership requirements are met, with the exception of any sale of shares during the lock-up period required to meet any tax obligations 
and social security premiums (including any other duties and levies) as a consequence of the vesting.
The tables below indicate the percentage of conditional shares that could vest in connection with the pre-determined performance 
conditions:
TSR ROCE Sustainability
Ranking Vesting Score Vesting Score Vesting
1 150% Excellent and above 150% Excellent and above 150%
2 125% Target 100% Target 100%
3 100% Threshold 50% Threshold 50%
4 75% Below threshold 0% Below threshold 0%
5 50%
6 25%
7 0%
8 0%
9 0%
10 0%
11 0%
At the end of each reporting period, BAM revises its estimates of the number of shares that are expected to vest based on the non-market 
vesting conditions (financial and non-financial) and recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income 
statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
In principle, conditionally awarded shares are forfeited if the participant is no longer employed by the company, however upon 
termination of employment due to retirement, disability or death the participant (or his or her heirs) reserves the right on the pro rata 
number of conditionally awarded shares to become unconditionally pursuant to the same vesting conditions as described above (pro rata 
means the number of full months that the participant was engaged by the Company during the performance period divided by
36 months). For the performance shares, the most recent performance results will be applied to calculate the number of vested shares.
The status of the Performance Share Plan (in number of shares) during 2020 for the members of the Executive Board and for all other 
participants is shown below:

The fair value per share of the 2020 award, for the participants, in connection with the TSR performance part amounted to €0.12 per 
share and is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. For the other financial and non-financial performance part, the fair value 
equals the share price at the date of award, corrected for the expected value of the possibility of achieving the ‘circuit breaker’. As 
participants receive dividend compensation the dividend yield on the awards equals nil.

Royal BAM Group nv169Integrated Report 2020
For the Performance Share Plan 2017 the ‘circuit breaker’ was applicable, leading to the full plan of 375,773 (remaining) shares to be 
forfeited as at the vesting date 27 April 2020.The most important assumptions used in the valuations of the fair values were as follows:
2020
Share price at award date (in €) 1.41 
Risk-free interest rate (in %) (0.61)
Volatility (in %) 39.34
Expected volatility has been determined based on historical volatilities for a period of five years. 
In 2020, an amount of €34,000 was charged (2019: €48,000 released) to the income statement arising from the Performance Share Plan. 
40. Joint operations
A part of the Group’s activities is carried out in joint arrangements and classified as joint operations. This applies to all activities and all 
countries in which the Group operates. These arrangements remain in place until a project is finished. In practice, the duration of the 
majority of the joint operations is limited to a period of between 1 and 4 years, with the exception of joint operations in connection with 
land and building rights held for strategic purposes.
Based on assessment of balance sheet total, revenue and result, none of the joint operations is material to the Group. The Group’s share of the 
revenue of these joint operations amounts to approximately €1.0 billion in 2020 (2019: approximately €1.0 billion), which represents 
approximately 15 per cent of the Group’s revenue (2019: 14 per cent).

1. Summary of significant accounting policies
1.1 Basis of preparation
The company financial statements of Royal BAM Group nv (‘the Company’ or ‘BAM’) have been prepared in accordance with Part 9,  
Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. In accordance with subsection 8 of section 362, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, the recognition and 
measurement principles applied in these parent company financial statements are the same as those applied in the consolidated 
financial statements (see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).
Regarding IFRS 9 combination 3, the Group has applied the Dutch ‘RJ 100.107a’ regarding expected credit losses. Therefore the expected 
credit losses on receivables from subsidiaries have not been included in the company financial statements, since these have been 
eliminated within the book value of the receivables.
1.2 Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are measured at net asset value. The net asset value is calculated using the accounting policies, as described 
in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. The net asset value of subsidiaries comprises the cost, excluding goodwill, of BAM’s 
share in the net assets of the subsidiary plus BAM’s share in income or losses since acquisition, less dividends received. 
1.3 Income tax
Corporate income tax is allocated to the subsidiaries forming part of the fiscal unit, as if they were independent taxable entities.

9.1 Reserves and retained earnings
Reserves comprise amounts for (cash flow) hedging, translation differences and legal reserve related to joint ventures. The legal reserves 
are required by Dutch law. Distributions to the shareholders of the Company are restricted to the extent of the balance.
The hedging reserve amounts to nil (2019: €95 million negative) and the translation reserve €99 million negative (2019: €89 million 
negative). The total reserves include additions in 2020 in legal reserves of AsfaltNu of €6 million (see note 5 of the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements) and in respect of the joint venture BAM PPP of €77 million (see note 37.3 of the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements).
For a further breakdown of the reserves see note 16 and 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
The total equity attributable to the shareholders of the Company amounts to €604 million and differs from the consolidated equity 
attributable to the shareholders of the Company with €21 million. The difference relates to the negative equity value of a certain 
subsidiary which has been valued at nil. The Company does not foresee an outflow of cash and expects that the equity will be positive in 
near future. The difference has been recognised in the net result for the year.

Based on our procedures performed, nothing has come to our 
attention that causes us to believe that the other non-financial 
information does not present, in all material respects, a reliable and 
adequate view of the policy and business operations with regard to 
corporate social responsibility and the thereto related events and 
achievements for the year 2020 in accordance with the 
Sustainability Reporting Standards (core option) of the Global 
Reporting Initiative (hereafter: GRI Standards) and the applied 
supplemental reporting criteria as disclosed in appendix 9.6

Based on our procedures performed according to the requirements 
of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 
720, we conclude that the other information included in the 
Report, including the executive board report and the report from 
the supervisory board:
• Is co
nsistent with the financial statements and does not contain 
material misstatements

tains the information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 and 
Sections 2:135b and 2:145 sub section 2 of the Dutch Civil Code
Basis for our conclusions

We believe the assurance evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusions.

could result in a conflict of interest with our independent assurance 
engagements. Furthermore, we have complied with the Verordening 
gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics).

The references to external sources or websites in the non-financial 
information, except for the GRI Disclosures which are available on the 
website of Royal BAM Group nv, are not part of the non-financial 
information as reviewed and audited by us. Also, as mentioned by Royal 
BAM Group nv in the Enhancing lives section (page 34), the reported 
number of enhanced lives is not part of the non-financial information as 
reviewed by us. We therefore do not provide assurance on this 
information.
Reporting criteria
The financial statements and the non-financial information need to be 
read and understood together with the reporting criteria. Royal BAM 
Group nv is solely responsible for selecting and applying these 
reporting criteria, taking into account applicable law and regulations 
related to reporting. 
The absence of an established practice on which to draw, to evaluate and 
measure non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, 
measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities 
and over time.
The reporting criteria used for the preparation of the financial 
statements and the non-financial information are presented below.
Consolidated financial 
statements
International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European 
Union (EU-IFRS) and Part 9 of Book 2 
of the Dutch Civil Code
Company financial statements, 
report by the board of 
management and report of the 
supervisory board
Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil 
Code
Non-financial information GRI Standards and the applied 
supplemental reporting criteria as 
disclosed in appendix 9.6 Non-financial 
reporting process and methods on 
pages 208-210 of the Report.
Our audit approach
Our understanding of the business
Royal BAM Group nv (‘the Company’ or ‘BAM’) offers its clients a 
substantial package of products and services in the sectors Construction 
and Property, Civil Engineering and Public Private Partnerships. The 
Company is structured in components and is mainly active in the 
Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Germany, and 
we tailored our group audit approach accordingly. We paid specific 
attention in our audit to a number of areas driven by the operations of 
the Company and our risk assessment.
We start by determining materiality and identifying and assessing the 
risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due 
to fraud, non-compliance with laws and regulations or error in order to 
design audit procedures responsive to those risks and to obtain audit 
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may 
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control.
In 2020 we were forced to perform our procedures to a greater extent 
remotely due to the Covid-19 measures. This limits our observation and 
increases the risk of missing certain signals. In order to compensate for 
the limitations related to physical contact and direct observation, we 
performed alternative procedures to obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Materiality
General
The scope of our assurance procedures is influenced by the 
application of materiality. Our assurance engagements aim to provide 
assurance about whether the financial statements and the non-
financial information are free from material misstatement. 
Misstatements may arise due to fraud or errors. They are considered 
to be material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the (economic) decisions of 
users taken on the basis of the financial statements and the non-
financial information. The materiality affects the nature, timing and 
extent of our assurance procedures and the evaluation of the effect of 
identified misstatements on our conclusions.
Financial statements
For the audit of the financial statements our considerations regarding 
the materiality are as follows:
Materiality €30 million (2019: €35 million)
Benchmark used 0.5 per cent of revenue 
Additional 
explanation
Based on our analyses of the common 
information needs of users of the financial 
statements, we consider profit before tax the 
most appropriate benchmark to determine 
materiality. However, profit before tax has 
been volatile in recent years and is not yet at a 
representative level, given the nature and size 
of the business. For this reason we considered 
revenues to be a more appropriate benchmark 
to determine the materiality. 
We have also taken into account misstatements and/or possible 
misstatements that in our opinion are material for the users of the 
financial statements for qualitative reasons.
We agreed with the supervisory board that misstatements in excess of 
€1.5 million, which are identified during the audit, would be reported to 
them, as well as smaller misstatements that in our view must be 
reported on qualitative grounds.

Non-financial information
Based on our professional judgment we determined materiality levels 
for each relevant part of the non-financial information and for the 
non-financial information as a whole. When evaluating our materiality 
levels, we have taken into account quantitative and qualitative 
considerations as well as the relevance of information for both 
stakeholders and the Company. 
We agreed with the supervisory board that misstatements which are 
identified during our work and which in our view must be reported on 
quantitative or qualitative grounds, would be reported to them.
Our scope for the Group audit of the financial 
statements
Royal BAM Group nv is the head of a group of entities primarily located 
in the Company’s home countries (the Netherlands, Belgium, the United 
Kingdom, Ireland and Germany), along with certain corporate functions 
part of Royal BAM Group nv’s headquarters. The financial information of 
this group is included in the consolidated financial statements of Royal 
BAM Group nv.
Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also 
responsible for directing, supervising and performing the group audit. 
In this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit 
procedures to be carried out for group entities. Decisive were the size 
and/or the risk profile of the group entities or operations. On this basis, 
we selected group entities for which an audit or review had to be carried 
out on the complete set of financial information or specific items. 
Our group audit focused on significant group entities. Entities are 
considered significant either because of their individual financial 
significance or because they are likely to include significant risks of 
material misstatement due to their specific nature or circumstances. 
On this basis, we selected entities for which an audit or review had to be 
carried out on the complete set of financial information or on specific 
items. In establishing the overall approach to the audit, we determined 
the audit procedures required to be performed by us, as Group auditors 
or by (non-)EY Global member firms operating under our instructions.
For the foreign Royal BAM Group nv home countries, we involved EY 
component auditors, who are familiar with local laws and regulations 
and who applied full scope audits. Because of the (international) travel 
restrictions and social distancing due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we had 
to restrict or were unable to visit foreign local management and foreign 
component auditors to discuss, among others, the business activities 
and the identified significant risks or to review and evaluate relevant 
parts of the component auditor’s audit documentation and to discuss 
significant matters arising from that evaluation on site. In these 
extraordinary circumstances we predominantly used electronic 
communication technology and written information exchange. 
In order to take responsibility as Group auditor in line with current 
auditing standards, and to compensate for the limitations related to 
physical contact and direct observation, we performed alternative 
procedures to obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion. We intensified communication with 
component teams, required more granular reporting (including 
detailed work programs), reviewed electronic audit files of component 
auditors in Germany and Ireland, performed audit procedures centrally, 
and intensified communication with management and those charged 
with governance. 
BAM International has, for purpose of the 2020 audit, engaged EY 
Canada for the audit procedures on a project in Canada. For the Middle 
East projects, BAM International has involved a local non-EY audit firm. 
Because of the (international) travel restrictions we performed similar 
alternative procedures in order to take responsibility as Group auditor.
We concluded that we can rely on both the EY and non-EY component 
auditors and their work performed in relation to the audit of the 
consolidated financial statements of Royal BAM Group nv.
We have performed audit procedures ourselves for entities within the 
Group located in the Netherlands, thereby focusing on the key risk areas. 
Apart from focusing on significant entities within the Group, we also 
reviewed and selected projects on a risk basis, thereby taking into 
consideration the size and nature of projects, as well as the countries in 
which projects are being executed. 
As a result of the above mentioned procedures, we have covered all 
entities and foreign locations that are significant to the consolidated 
financial statements of Royal BAM Group nv. In addition, we have 
performed analytical review procedures and made inquiries with the 
executive board with respect to some smaller locations that are not 
material and made sure that there are no developments or exposures 
that should have been covered.
By performing the procedures mentioned above at entities within the 
Group, together with additional procedures at Group level, we have 
been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence about the 
Group’s financial information to provide an opinion about the 
consolidated financial statements.
Teaming, use of specialists
We ensured that the audit teams both at group and at component levels 
included the appropriate skills and competences which are needed for 
the audit of a listed client in the real estate and construction industry. 
We included specialists in the areas of IT audit, treasury, income tax, 
pensions, construction projects, land and building rights, share based 
payments, derivatives and forensics.
Our focus on fraud and non-compliance with laws 
and regulations
Our responsibility
Although we are not responsible for preventing fraud or non-compliance 
188Integrated Report 2020 Royal BAM Group nv

Page 189:
and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and 
regulations, it is our responsibility to obtain reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
Non-compliance with laws and regulations may result in fines, litigation 
or other consequences for the Company that may have a material effect 
on the financial statements.
Our audit response related to fraud risks
In order to identify and assess the risks of material misstatements of the 
financial statements due to fraud, we obtained an understanding of the 
entity and its environment, including the entity’s internal control 
relevant to the audit and in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. As in all of our audits, we addressed 
the risk of management override of internal control. We do not audit 
internal control per se for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.
We considered available information and made enquiries of relevant 
executives, directors (including internal audit, legal, compliance, human 
resources and regional directors) and the supervisory board. As part of 
our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors 
with respect to financial reporting fraud, misappropriation of assets and 
bribery and corruption in close co-operation with our forensic specialists.
In our risk assessment we considered the potential impact of pressure to 
meet financial targets, to demonstrate that the actions to limit exposure 
to losses have been successful, or to meet certain KPIs necessary to meet 
debt covenants. We also considered the valuation of variable 
considerations due to the inherent uncertainties.
In our process of identifying fraud risks, we considered whether the 
Covid-19 pandemic gives rise to specific fraud risk factors resulting 
from a dilution in the effectiveness of controls as a result of the 
general disruption associated with remote working, illness and 
workforce reductions, supply chain failures, management overrides 
and abuse of government schemes intended to support companies 
during the pandemic. 
We evaluated the design and implementation and, where considered 
appropriate, tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls that 
mitigate fraud risks. In addition, we performed procedures to evaluate 
key accounting estimates for management bias in particular relating to 
important judgment areas and significant accounting estimates as 
disclosed in Note 4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainties in the financial statements. We have also used 
data analysis to identify and address high-risk journal entries.
We incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit. We 
considered the outcome of our other audit procedures and evaluated 
whether any findings were indicative of fraud or non-compliance. If so, 
we reevaluate our assessment of fraud risk and its resulting impact on 
our audit procedures.
Our audit response related to risks of non-compliance with laws and 
regulations
We assessed factors related to the risks of non-compliance with laws 
and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material 
effect on the financial statements from our general industry 
experience, through discussions with the management board, reading 
minutes, inspection of internal audit and compliance reports and 
performing substantive tests of details of classes of transactions, 
account balances or disclosures.
We also inspected lawyers’ letters and correspondence with regulatory 
authorities and remained alert to any indication of (suspected) 
non-compliance throughout the audit. Finally we obtained written 
representations that all known instances of non-compliance with laws 
and regulations have been disclosed to us.
Going concern
We performed the following procedures in order to identify and assess 
the risks of going concern and to conclude on the appropriateness of 
management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting. 
Management made a specific assessment of the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern and to continue its operations for at least 
the next 12 months. We discussed and evaluated the assessment with 
management exercising professional judgment and maintaining 
professional skepticism, and specifically focusing on the process followed 
by management to make the assessment, management bias that could 
represent a risk, the impact of current events and conditions have on the 
Company’s operations and forecasted cash flows, with a focus on 
whether the Company will have sufficient liquidity to continue to meet 
its obligations as they fall due. We consider based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the 
related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date 
of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause 
a company to cease to continue as a going concern. We refer to our key 
audit matter ‘Going concern and compliance with debt covenants’.

The key audit matter ‘Implementation of IFRS 16’ (Leases) which was 
included in our last year’s auditor’s report, is not considered a key audit 
matter for this year as the Company has adopted this standard in 2019. 
Following the exceptional circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic and 
the considerable impact on Royal BAM Group nv’s operations, we paid 
additional attention to the Company’s going concern and compliance 
with the bank covenants. We therefore considered this topic to be a 
new key audit matter for the audit of the financial statements 2020.
For the audit of the financial statements 2020 we identified the 
following key audit matters:
•  Evaluating whether the financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves 
fair presentation
Our key audit and assurance matters
Key audit and assurance matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgment, were of most significance in our assurance 
procedures for the financial statements and the non-financial 
information. We have communicated the key audit and assurance 
matters to the supervisory board. The key audit and assurance matters 
are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed.
These matters were addressed in the context of our assurance 
procedures for the financial statements and the non-financial 
information as a whole and to conclude thereon, and we do not provide 
a separate conclusion on these matters. 
Going concern and compliance with debt covenants
Refer to page 89 (Note 2.1.3 Assessment on going concern assumption) and page 138-142 (Note 19. Borrowings)
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the matter Key observations
In 2020, BAM was faced with the exceptional 
circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic, that amongst 
others led to BAM’s precautionary measure to fully draw 
the RCF for €400 million in March 2020. In addition, 
BAM’s performance in the first half year was also 
impacted by the Cologne metro settlement and 
continued losses at BAM International. These 
developments resulted in two RCF-covenant ratios below 
its threshold per 30 June 2020, for which BAM obtained a 
waiver.
The continued uncertainty of Covid-19, (inherent) project 
valuation risks and potential impairment triggers gave 
rise to additional attention to the Company’s going 
concern assessment as per 31 December 2020 and its 
compliance with the bank covenants in our audit. We 
therefore considered this to be a key audit matter.
BAM’s going concern and covenant assessment is 
primarily based on expected future cashflows and 
forecasted results, among others derived from the 2021 
operating plan and the strategic agenda 2021-2023 as 
approved by the supervisory board, and the executive 
board’s outlook based on order intake and expected 
margins for new projects for 2021 and beyond.
Our audit procedures included assessing the Company’s 
assessment and assumptions underlying the estimated 
future results for their reasonableness and consistency 
with internal budgets, strategic plans for future years, 
order intake and expected margins for new projects for 
2021 and beyond. We also challenged the executive 
board’s expectations of future results, challenged risk 
adjustments made by the executive board and we 
assessed the historical accuracy of the executive board’s 
assumptions (back-testing) and analysed the rationale 
for differences between expected results and the actual 
results.
We assessed the reasonableness of BAM’s assumptions 
underlying the sensitivity analysis for the expected 
future cashflows and forecasted results. We also 
challenged the analysis and impact on BAM’s 
headroom considering the agreed bank covenants.  
We assessed the Company’s debt agreements, waiver 
contracts, the agreed bank covenants and 
communications between BAM and its banks. We also 
involved corporate financing experts in these 
procedures.
We concur with 
management’s 
assessment and the 
disclosures on going 
concern and the debt 
covenants in the Report 
also taking into account 
the disclosures on risks 
and sensitivities. In our 
view the disclosures in 
the Report are 
proportionate and in 
accordance with 
EU-IFRS.

Going concern and compliance with debt covenants (continued)
Refer to page 89 (Note 2.1.3 Assessment on going concern assumption) and page 138-142 (Note 19. Borrowings)
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the matter Key observations
Estimation of future cashflows and results inherently 
involves a high degree of judgment. The executive board 
has assessed the inherent uncertainties – including 
Covid-19 and currently identified project risks – in 
forecasting BAM’s compliance with debt covenants as part 
of its sensitivity analysis. BAM in its judgement concluded 
that given the outcome of the going concern assessment 
and sensitivity analyses performed, it is appropriate to 
prepare the financial statements on the basis of going 
concern and despite the factors and uncertainties 
described above, there are no material uncertainties that 
may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern in the year subsequent to the 
date of these financial statements. Given the continuing 
uncertainty related to the impact of Covid-19, BAM closely 
monitors the developments regarding Covid-19 and 
analyses risks for its financial results, position and cash 
flows and implementing further mitigating actions when 
deemed necessary.
We involved valuation specialists to determine the 
reasonableness of the assumptions and appropriateness 
of the models used by BAM in determining the future 
cashflows and forecasted results.
Valuation of projects and revenue recognition
Refer to pages 47-51 (executive board report), pages 113-114 (Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainties) and 
pages 119-121 (Note 6. Projects)
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the matter Key observations
The valuation of projects and revenue recognition are 
significant to the financial statements based on the 
quantitative materiality and the degree of management 
judgment required to account for complex projects and 
to apply the percentage of completion method.  We 
therefore considered this to be a key audit matter.
BAM is involved in large and complex construction 
projects for which the Company applies the percentage 
of completion method. The amount of project revenue, 
profit recognised as well as provisions for onerous 
contracts in a year is dependent, inter alia, on the actual 
costs incurred, the assessment of the percentage of 
completion of (long-term) contracts and the forecasted 
contract revenue and costs to complete of each project.
Furthermore, the amount of revenue and result is 
influenced by the valuation of variation orders and claims. 
This often involves a high degree of judgment due to the 
complexity of projects, uncertainty about costs to 
complete and uncertainty about the outcome of 
discussions with clients on variation orders and claims, 
thereby taking into account the various parts of the world 
BAM operates in.
Our audit procedures included an assessment of the 
internal control environment of BAM, testing existence 
of relevant controls, performing physical and digital site 
visits (using webcams and drones), vouching project 
valuations and testing the executive board’s position 
against supporting documentation and BAM’s 
accounting policy. 
For long-term contracts, we also compared the position 
BAM is currently taking to the positions taken in 
previous year, to ensure consistency in the valuation and 
to perform back testing on this estimate.
In cases where a high amount of judgment is involved, 
we gained additional comfort by comparing the 
executive board’s positions to opinions from external 
parties such as lawyers or surveyors. 
For specific complex projects we involved our own 
quantity surveyors and internal construction experts to 
determine the reasonableness of the executive board’s 
estimations of variable considerations and costs to 
complete.
Overall, in our view 
projects have been 
valued in accordance 
with EU-IFRS, thereby 
taking into account the 
disclosures with 
respect to risk and 
uncertainty mentioned 
on the pages referred 
to above.

Valuation of goodwill and deferred tax assets
Refer to page 23 (executive board report), pages 113-114 (Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainties), 
pages 124-125 (Note 9. Intangible assets) and pages 153-154 (Note 24. Deferred tax assets and liabilities)
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the matter Key observations
As per 31 December 2020, BAM recognised goodwill 
(€319 million) and net deferred tax assets (€93 million).
The valuation of both goodwill and deferred tax assets is 
primarily based on expected future cashflows and 
forecasted results, among others derived from the 2021 
operating plan and strategic agenda 2021-2023 as 
approved by the supervisory board, and the executive 
board’s outlook based on order intake and expected 
margins for new projects for 2021 and beyond.
Estimation of future cashflows and results inherently 
involves a high degree of judgment. We therefore 
considered this to be a key audit matter.
To reflect for the deteriorated market conditions in 
respect of Covid-19, poor performance of certain 
underlying CGU’s and decision to winddown BAM 
International, the executive board reduced the expected 
forecasted results for 2021 and onwards. 
 
For goodwill valuation purposes, BAM’s reassessment led 
to an impairment of € 60 million, primarily on CGU’s BAM 
International, BAM Contractors nv and BAM Germany. 
CGU’s with limited headroom are disclosed on page 125  
of the Report. 
The reduced expected forecasted results led to an 
impairment of €69 million of the recognized deferred tax 
assets related to tax losses carried forward in the 
Netherlands and Germany.
Our audit procedures included an assessment of the 
Company’s assumptions underlying the estimated future 
(taxable) results for their reasonableness and consistency 
with operating plans, strategic plans for future years, order 
intake and expected margins for new projects for 2021 and 
beyond. We also challenged the executive board’s 
expectations of future (taxable) results, challenged risk 
adjustments made by the executive board and we assessed 
the historical accuracy of the executive board’s assumptions 
(back-testing) and analysed the rationale for differences 
between expected results and the actual results.
We involved valuation and tax specialists to determine the 
reasonableness of the assumptions and appropriateness of 
the models used by BAM in determining the valuation of 
goodwill and deferred tax assets.
In our view, the 
executive board’s 
assessment on the 
recognised goodwill 
and deferred tax 
assets is reasonable 
and within the 
acceptable range of 
the requirements of 
EU-IFRS. 
Valuation of land and building rights
Refer to pages 113-114 (Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainties) and pages 119-121 (Note 6. Projects)
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the matter Key observations
The estimates supporting the value of land and building 
rights relate to terms which vary from one year to more 
than thirty years, due to which the estimation uncertainty 
is significant. We therefore considered this to be a key 
audit matter.
We have assessed the calculations of the land and building 
rights net realizable values and challenged the reasonableness 
and consistency of the assumptions used by the executive 
board. We also determined consistency with prior years and 
external available information such as external appraisals and 
plans and decisions of government bodies. 
We also compared the executive board’s assumptions concerning 
the development of prices of residential housing with 
independent expectations of external parties and institutions.
We involved valuation specialists to determine the 
reasonableness of the assumptions and models used by BAM 
to support the value of land and building rights.
In our view the 
valuation applied by 
BAM is in line with 
EU-IFRS.

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
Engagement
We have been appointed in the shareholders meeting on 22 April 2015 
as auditors of Royal BAM Group nv as of the audit for the year 2016 and 
have operated as statutory auditor since that date.
No prohibited non-audit services 
We have not provided prohibited non-audit services as referred to in 
Article 5(1) of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding 
statutory audit of public-interest entities.
Other non-prohibited services provided 
In addition to the statutory audit of the financial statements we mainly 
provided the following services:
•  Agr
eed upon procedures on debt covenants and other financial ratios
•  Ass
urance on other items than the consolidated financial statements 
of Royal BAM Group nv (such as local statutory audits and assurance 
on the Carbon footprint Scope 1 and 2 as included in the Report CO2 
emissie inventaris of Royal BAM Group nv)
•  Ass
urance on non-financial information as described in the section 
‘Our scope’ of this report
All non-prohibited services provided have been pre-approved by the 
audit committee.
For the assurance engagement on the non-financial information, we identified the following key assurance matter:
Completeness registration of safety incidents
Refer to pages 26-29 (executive board report) and pages 208-210 (Appendix 9.6 Non-financial reporting process and methods)
Key assurance matter How our assurance engagement addressed 
the matter
Key observations
Royal BAM Group nv uses and discloses own reporting 
criteria for the KPI Incident Frequency BAM (‘IF BAM’) and 
the number of serious accidents. 
The complexity of the scoping of the indicators and the 
decentralised organisation of BAM inherently involves risk 
that not all reported safety incidents are registered. We 
therefore considered this to be a key assurance matter.
Our assurance procedures focused on the suitability of 
the reporting criteria, inquiry of responsible personnel 
from different levels within the organisation on how 
BAM monitors this risk and which controls are in place 
to mitigate this risk. We performed test of detail 
procedures, on group and operational company level, to 
verify the completeness of the registered safety 
incidents. We have also reviewed whether the 
disclosures in the Report, including any inherent 
limitations in measurement, are adequate.
We concur with the 
reporting criteria 
applied and the 
disclosures made.
Responsibilities
Responsibilities of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board
The executive board is responsible for the preparation and fair 
presentation of the financial statements in accordance with 
EU-IFRS and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, and for the 
preparation of the other information, including the executive 
board report in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the 
Dutch Civil Code, the other information pursuant to Part 9 of 
Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and the remuneration report in 
accordance with Sections 2:135b and 2:145 sub section 2 of the 
Dutch Civil Code. 
The executive board is also responsible for the preparation of 
reliable and adequate non-financial information in accordance 
with the GRI Standards and the applied supplemental reporting 
criteria, including the identification of the stakeholders and the 
determination of material issues. The choices made by the 
executive board with respect to the scope of the non-financial 
information are included in appendix 9.6 Non-financial reporting 
processes and methods (pages 208-210) of the Report. 
Furthermore, the executive board is responsible for such internal 
control as the executive board determines is necessary to enable 
the preparation of the financial statements and the non-financial

Work performed
We have exercised professional judgment and have maintained 
professional skepticism throughout the assurance engagements 
performed by a multi-disciplinary team, in accordance with the 
Dutch Standards on Auditing and the Dutch assurance standards, 
ethical requirements and independence requirements. 
Our audit to obtain reasonable assurance about the financial 
statements (consolidated and corporate) included the following: 
• Ide
ntifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of 
the financial statements, whether due to fraud or errors, 
designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those 
risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is 
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control 
• Obt
aining an understanding of internal control relevant to the 
audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control 
• Eva
luating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and 
the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by the executive board 
• Eva
luating the overall presentation, structure and content of 
the financial statements, including the disclosures
• Eva
luating whether the financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves 
fair presentation
Our review to obtain limited assurance about the non-financial 
information included the following:
•  Per
forming an analysis of the external environment and 
obtaining an understanding of relevant social themes and issues 
and the characteristics of the Company
•  Eva
luating the appropriateness of the reporting criteria used, 
their consistent application and related disclosures in the 
non-financial information. This includes the evaluation of the 
results of the stakeholders’ dialogue and the reasonableness of 
estimates made by the executive board
•  Obt
aining an understanding of the reporting processes for the 
non-financial information, including obtaining a general 
understanding of internal control relevant to our review
•  Iden
tifying areas of the non-financial information with a higher 
risk of misleading or unbalanced information or material 
misstatements, whether due to fraud or errors. Designing and 
performing further procedures aimed at determining the 
plausibility of the non-financial information responsive to this 
risk analysis. These further review procedures consisted of:
 -  Int
erviewing the executive board and relevant staff at 
corporate and local levels responsible for the sustainability 
strategy, policies and results
 -  Int
erviewing relevant staff responsible for providing the 
information that are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or errors. 
As part of the preparation of the financial statements, the 
executive board is responsible for assessing the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial 
reporting frameworks mentioned, the executive board should 
prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis 
of accounting unless the executive board either intends to 
liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no 
realistic alternative but to do so. The executive board should 
disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant 
doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern 
in the financial statements. 
The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the 
(financial) reporting process of Royal BAM Group nv.
Our responsibility
Our responsibility is to plan and perform the assurance 
engagements in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and 
appropriate assurance evidence for our conclusions. 
Our audit of the financial statements and our audit of the 
selected non-financial information have been performed with a 
high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may 
not detect all material errors and fraud during our audit. 
Our review of the other non-financial information is aimed to 
obtain a limited level of assurance. The assurance procedures 
performed to obtain a limited level of assurance are aimed to 
determine the plausibility of information and vary in nature and 
timing from, and are less in extent, than for a reasonable 
assurance engagement. The level of assurance obtained in a 
review is therefore substantially less than the assurance obtained 
in an audit.
We apply the Nadere voorschriften kwaliteitssystemen (NVKS, 
Regulations for Quality management systems) and accordingly 
maintain a comprehensive system of quality control including 
documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with 
ethical requirements, professional standards and other relevant 
legal and regulatory requirements.

information contains material misstatements. By performing 
these procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of 
Book 2 and Section 2:135b sub-Section 7 of the Dutch Civil Code 
and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of the procedures 
performed on the other information is substantially less than the 
scope of those performed in our audit of the financial statements 
or in our review of the non-financial information.
Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also 
responsible for directing, supervising and performing the group 
audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and extent of 
the audit procedures to be carried out for entities within the 
Group. Decisive were the size and/or the risk profile of the entities 
within the Group or operations. On this basis, we selected entities 
within the Group for which an audit or review had to be carried 
out on the complete set of financial information or specific items.
We communicate with the supervisory board regarding, among 
other matters, the planned scope and timing of the assurance 
procedures and significant findings, including any significant 
findings in internal control that we identify during our assurance 
engagements. In this respect we also submit an additional report 
to the audit committee in accordance with Article 11 of the EU 
Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of 
public-interest entities. The information included in this additional 
report is consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor’s report.
We provide the supervisory board with a statement that we have 
complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships 
and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. 
From the matters communicated with the supervisory board, we 
determine those matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the financial statements and the assurance engagement 
on the non-financial information of the current period and are 
therefore the key audit and assurance matters. We describe these 
matters in our combined independent auditor’s report unless law 
or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or 
when, in extremely rare circumstances, not communicating the 
matter is in the public interest.

In addition to the procedures mentioned above, for the selected 
non-financial information we identified and assessed the risks that 
the selected non-financial information is misleading or 
unbalanced, or contains material misstatements, whether due to 
fraud or errors. We designed and performed further audit 
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtained audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion. The risk that the other non-financial information is 
misleading or unbalanced, or the risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting 
from errors. Fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 
These further audit procedures included the following procedures:
•  Obt

(Summary of Article 31 of the Articles of Association)
From the profit realised in any financial year, an amount will first 
be distributed, where possible, on the class B cumulative 
preference shares, calculated by applying the percentage stated 
below to the mandatory amount paid up on those shares as at the 
start of the financial year for which the distribution is made. The 
percentage referred to above will be equal to the average of the 
Euribor rates for money market loans with a maturity of twelve 
months – weighted according to the number of days for which 
these rates prevailed – during the financial year for which the 
distribution is made, plus one percentage point. Euribor refers to 
the Euro Interbank Offered Rate as determined and published by 
the European Central Bank.
Subsequently, if possible, a dividend will be distributed on each 
financing preference share of a certain series, with due 
consideration of the provisions of this article, equal to an amount 
calculated by applying a percentage to the nominal amount of the 
financing preference share concerned at the start of that financial 
year, plus the amount of share premium paid in on the financing 
preference share issued in the series concerned at the time of 
initial issue of the financing preference shares of that series, less 
the amount paid out on each financing preference share 
concerned and charged to the share premium reserve formed at 
the time of issue of the financing preference shares of that series 
prior to that financial year. If and to the extent that a distribution 
has been made on the financing preference shares concerned in 
the course of the year and charged to the share premium reserve 
formed at the time of issue of the financing preference shares of 
the series concerned, or partial repayment has been made on such 
shares, the amount of the distribution will be reduced pro rata 
over the period concerned according to the amount of the 
distribution charged to the share premium reserve and/or the 
repayment with respect to the amount referred to in the 
preceding sentence.
The calculation of the dividend percentage for the financing 
preference shares of a certain series will be made for each of the 
series of financing preference shares referred to below, in the 
manner set forth for the series concerned.
Series FP1 to FP4
The dividend percentage will be calculated by taking the 
arithmetic mean of the yield to maturity on euro government 
loans issued by the Kingdom of the Netherlands with a remaining 
term matching as closely as possible the term of the series 
concerned, as published in the Euronext Prices Lists, plus two 
percentage points.
Series FP5 to FP8
The dividend percentage will be equal to the average of the 
Euribor rates for money market loans with a maturity of twelve 
months – weighted according to the number of days for which

Royal BAM Group nv has taken the following measures to protect 
itself against any undesired developments that might have an 
impact on the independence, continuity and/or identity of the 
Company and the group of companies associated with the 
Company.
Pursuant to a resolution passed by the General Meeting held on 12 
June 1972, the Articles of Association include the possibility of 
issuing preference shares. Stichting Aandelenbeheer BAM Groep 
(hereafter referred to as ‘the Foundation’) was founded with a view 
to this possibility in 1978. The objective of the Foundation is to 
look after the interests of the Company and the Group. Specifically, 
the Foundation seeks to ensure that the interests of the Company, 
the Group and all their stakeholders are safeguarded as much as 
possible, and that influences which could undermine the 
independence and/or continuity and/or identity of the Company 
and the Group and which are in conflict with those interests are 
averted to the best of the Foundation’s ability. The Foundation 
attempts to achieve its objective by acquiring and holding class B 
cumulative preference shares in the Company’s capital, by 
exercising the rights connected with those shares and/or by using 
its right of enquiry.
As announced at the General Meeting held on 4 June 1992 and 
considered at the General Meeting on 8 June 1993, the company 
granted the Foundation an option to acquire class B cumulative 
preference shares in the Company’s capital on 17 May 1993. This 
option was granted up to such an amount as the Foundation might 
require, subject to a maximum of a nominal amount that would 
result in the total nominal amount of class B cumulative preference 
shares in issue and not held by the company equalling no more 
than ninety-nine point nine per cent (99.9 per cent) of the nominal 
amount of the issued share capital in the form of shares other than 
class B cumulative preference shares and not held by the company 
at the time of exercising of the right referred to above. The board 
of the Foundation has the exclusive right to determine whether or 
not to exercise this right to acquire class B cumulative preference 
shares. No class B cumulative preference shares have been issued 
at this time.
On 6 October 2008, the Company granted the Foundation the 
right, under Article 2:346(c) of the Dutch Civil Code, to submit a 
petition as referred to in Article 2:345 of the Dutch Civil Code 
(right of enquiry).
The Supervisory Board and the Executive Board reserve the right, 
in the interests of the Company and its associated companies, to 
resolve to take alternative measures in order to protect the 
Company and the Group against influences that might be regarded 
by the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board, after balancing 
the interests of the company and all of the stakeholders in the 
Group, as being potentially damaging to the independence, 
continuity and/or identity of the Company and/or the Group.

Subordinated unsecured convertible bonds 
In 2016, BAM placed €125 million subordinated unsecured 
convertible bonds to redeem the existing subordinated loan of the 
same amount. The transaction was in line with BAM’s financing 
strategy to strengthen its balance sheet by lengthening the 
maturity and broadening the sources of its funding. It also 
improved BAM’s commercial position and supports the execution 
of its strategy.
The bonds have an annual coupon of 3.5 per cent, an initial 
conversion premium of 32.5 per cent and are convertible into 
ordinary shares of BAM with a nominal value of €0.10 each. The 
bonds were issued at 100 per cent of their principal amount and, 
unless previously redeemed, converted or purchased and 
cancelled, the bonds will be redeemed at their principal amount 
on or around 13 June 2021. In December, BAM repurchased €4.9 
million of the outstanding subordinated unsecured convertible 
bond at an average price of 97 per cent of the nominal value.   
Upon exercise of their conversion rights, holders will receive 
shares at the then prevailing conversion price. BAM will have the 
option to call all but not some of the outstanding bonds at their 
principal amount plus accrued but unpaid interest from 28 June 
2019, if the value of the shares underlying a bond exceeds 
€130,000 for a specified period. The bonds are trading on the 
Open Market (Freiverkehr) segment of the Frankfurt Stock 
Exchange.
More details of the subordinated unsecured convertible bond are 
published on www.bam.com under the link Investor relations.
Dividend policy 
BAM has a dividend policy to distribute a dividend between 30 
and 50 per cent of the net result for the year. When deciding upon 
the dividend, the Company considers the balance sheet structure 
supporting the strategic agenda. In accordance with the 
Company’s dividend policy the proposal is to distribute no 
dividend per ordinary share for 2020 (2019: no dividend, proposal 
of 2 euro cents was later withdrawn in reaction to the outbreak of 
the Covid-19 pandemic).

Reporting criteria: GRI Standards - Core 
This report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: 
Core option. An overview of the GRI disclosures covered by this 
report is available on BAM’s website (www.bam.com/en/
sustainability/reports-and-policies). In this overview, more 
information is disclosed on the nature and coverage of reporting per 
GRI disclosure (e.g. quantitatively or qualitatively).
Reporting period and reporting frequency
This report presents both quantitative and qualitative data for the 
calendar year 2020. For some operating companies or topics an 
exception is made and a reporting period of 1 December 2019 to 
30 November 2020 is applied. BAM allows for this different 
reporting period when due to a complex operating and reporting 
structure more time is required to ensure that the reported data are 
reliable and adequate. BAM considers the effects of a different 
reporting period as not material to the Company’s integrated 
report. There have been no significant changes from previous 
reporting periods in the scope and boundaries.
Reporting boundaries
Non-financial performance and data are accounted for according to 
BAM’s share of equity. As an exception to this rule, BAM International 
reports all non-financial data for joint arrangement projects in which 
it is the leading party. In general, BAM views disclosure regarding 
acquisitions and divestments on a case-by-case basis.
Reporting process
The integrated report, including all material aspects, is compiled by 
the Executive Board and discussed with the Supervisory Board. BAM 
uses a reporting system for non-financial information (including 
safety, CO
2, waste and HR), as an extension of the financial 
reporting system. The applied reporting processes and definitions 
are formalised in BAM’s non-financial reporting manual, which 
provides guidance on how to collect, consolidate and report data.
Reporting indicators
For BAM’s main non-financial indicators this chapter provides further 
insight below. For other quantitative indicators disclosures on the 
reporting scope and methods used are given elsewhere in this 
report.
Safety
BAM defines its incident frequency (IF) as the number of BAM 
employees (not including site employees outsourced to external 
companies) involved in industrial incidents leading to absence from 
work per million hours worked on construction sites. Reportable 
incidents are based on actual occurrences and are never 
extrapolated or estimated. Despite all measures and an open safety 
culture there is an inherent risk of incomplete accident reporting. 
BAM is partially dependent on information provided by the person 
involved in an accident. Reported hours are measured, calculated or 
estimated. The absolute number of reported serious accidents 
covers all BAM employees, subcontractors, hired employees and 
thirds on own projects and BAM employees, BAM subcontractors 
and direct hired employees by BAM on joint ventures. 
For all companies, except for BAM International, BAM includes only 
employee-related accidents and hours. BAM International considers 
all persons working under its direct supervision even though they 
may not have a labour contract with BAM directly. As a result, the 
accidents and hours worked by all persons working under the 
supervision of BAM International and irrespective of their labour 
contract are included in the reported incident frequency. 
Creating uniform safety reporting across all operating companies is 
one of the strategic objectives which create access to the right 
management information. BAM is in the process of enhancing the 
reporting process for worked hours of subcontractors. BAM strives 
to obtain reliable information by implementing automated on-site 
entrance systems such as tourniquets, fingerprint readers, iris scans 
and card systems.
BAM safety behaviour audit
In 2020, no safety behaviour audits (SBA) were carried out due to 
the Covid-19 pandemic. A safety behaviour audit is normally carried 
out following the official BAM safety behaviour audit (BAM-SBA) 
questionnaire 2016, which is aligned with the BAM Health and 
Safety Directive of January 2015. The audit template consists of the 
sections: safety climate, management system and site conditions. 
Each section is scored independently with all elements collated to 
provide the overall score. Additional points may be added for 
innovative practices and where areas of concern, points deducted. 
The scoring of the various sections is marked from 1 to 5 as below:
No evidence of commitment Poor 0% - 40%
Slight evidence of commitment Fair 41% - 60%
Commitment evident but room  
for improvement
Good 61% - 80%
G
ood commitment demonstrated Very good 81% - 90%
Excellent commitment demonstrated Excellent 91% - 100%
Safety climate:  management ambition and commitment to 
keeping workers safe is demonstrated through words and actions. 
Visual leadership coaching/ supporting the organisation, 
demonstration of intervention and enforcement where necessary.
 
Management system:  safety policies, processes and procedures 
used to the task specific requirements (including resources) to 
achieve its safety objectives by risk management, supply chain 
management and continuous improvement. Demonstrate 
learning ability of the organisation. Compliance with the law and 
safety regulations (including the Royal BAM Safety Directive).
Site conditions:  site setup, site logistics, collective and personal 
measurements to mitigate the task specific risks. Safe physical 
work environment and equipment. Demonstrate how to plan for 
safety and engage with the workforce.

Page 209:
The reported SBA score is the average of all individual operating 
company scores. It is the responsibility of safety officers from 
the operating company to organise the SBA interviews in detail 
and select the projects within the overall planning. Safety 
officers must consider the diversity in areas, business units, type 
of projects, phase of the projects. The selection of various 
projects could result into fluctuation of the score between the 
years. During all SBAs an independent person is present to 
oversee the results of all SBAs.
Business conduct and transparency
BAM has selected the percentage of employees that completed the 
Code of Conduct e-learning as KPI for business conduct and 
transparency. The definition of this KPI is: percentage of selected 
BAM employees that have completed the Code of Conduct 
e-learning since the launch in November 2019, to embed the 
training and awareness on the Code of Conduct requiremens and 
reporting, potential dilemma’s and guiding employees in their 
decisions on Code of Conduct-related matters. The scope of the 
selected employees for the e-learning are all BAM employees in 
offices and project offices and excludes blue-collar employees (e.g. 
carpenters, technicians) who are trained via a toolbox session. The 
e-learning is also not applied to subcontractors and suppliers on site.
Human Resources (HR)
HR data are obtained twice a year using a standardised reporting 
platform. HR data are derived from the HR accounts held by 
BAM’s operating companies. Due to different definitions used, 
breakdowns in paragraph Organisational development and 
employee engagement (  page 34) are based on figures that do 
not match the total number of FTE in Key figures. This does not 
result in different insights.
Energy consumption and CO 2 emissions
BAM’s energy consumption and greenhouse gas inventory are based 
on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard, Revised Edition (2013: Corporate Standard) as 
issued by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development 
and the World Resources Institute. BAM reports its greenhouse gas 
emissions as CO2 equivalent, considering other greenhouse gasses 
than CO2. BAM calculates the energy consumption (in terajoules) and 
CO2 emissions associated with BAM’s energy consumption, using 
conversion factors from reputable and authoritative sources. BAM 
applies country-specific conversion factors for electricity and natural 
gas, based on GHG emissions reported in national inventory reports 
(NIR). BAM uses tank-to-wheel emission factors. All conversion 
factors are reviewed annually and updated if necessary.
BAM’s reporting scope includes its direct CO2 emissions 
(scope 1 emissions, from BAM’s own sources), indirect CO2 emissions 
from the generation of purchased electricity consumed by BAM 
(scope 2 emissions) and employee travel-related scope 3 emissions.
The GHG Corporate value chain (scope 3) accounting and reporting 
standard for full scope 3 reporting has not been implemented.

sites which are to be discarded and subsequently leave offices, 
construction sites and/or BAM sites such as depots or premises.
Materials
BAM reports the amount of materials used and the recycled 
content of various materials used by Dutch operating companies. 
Raw materials which are consumed in large quantities and which 
have a significant impact on natural resources have been selected. 
The Company reports on concrete, timber, asphalt and steel.
Raw material consumption in the Netherlands was determined 
using supplier reports. Extrapolation of data was applied to cover 
all suppliers. BAM aspires to keep the extrapolated data below  
20 per cent. The results are verified against BAM’s procurement 
dat
abase, internal and external experts. The recycled content was 
determined based on information provided by suppliers.
 
Local sourcing
For the Dutch companies, BAM has investigated the extent to which 
its purchases are sourced locally. BAM has defined local sourcing as 
a purchase done with a supplier who is located in the same country 
as the construction site. BAM determines the percentage of local 
sourcing based on the country of residence of its suppliers. 
Verification
The Executive Board has appointed Ernst & Young 
Accountants LLP (EY) to provide independent assurance of 
the report to provide BAM’s stakeholders comfort over BAM’s 
non-financial information. As in previous years, BAM has 
obtained reasonable assurance for the following KPIs: IF BAM 
and number of serious accidents, as included in the ‘Safety’ 
section in paragraph 3.2. Additionally, EY has provided 
reasonable assurance over the ‘Material themes’ section in
  paragraph 2.3 and the ‘Business conduct and transparency’ 
section in  paragraph 3.2. For all other non-financial information 
reported in  paragraphs 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 3.2, 3.3, 9.6, 9.7 and on 
the GRI disclosures as published on BAM’s website, BAM has 
obtained limited assurance.
Contrary to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, BAM reports fuel 
consumption by leased vehicles under scope 1 emissions. Energy 
consumption from district heating and use of public transport are 
considered negligible and they are therefore not included in 
BAM’s overall energy consumption and related CO2 emissions. The 
basis for consolidated energy consumption and CO 2 emissions is 
activity data, which in turn are based mostly on meter readings, 
invoices and data provided by suppliers. Where reliable data are 
not available, BAM uses calculations or estimations using reliable 
methods and input data. BAM is satisfied that the estimates are 
reliable in all material respects.
Where clients provide BAM with electricity and BAM can receive 
reliable information on its client-supplied electricity consumption, 
the Company includes this consumption in its carbon footprint. 
Similarly, information received on CO2 emissions associated with  
air travel is included in BAM’s scope 3 emissions.
It occurs on projects that BAM supplies fuel and electricity to 
subcontractors. In accordance with BAM’s non-financial reporting 
manual the supplied fuel and electricity to subcontractors should  
be measured and excluded from reported figures, unless fuel and 
electricity are supplied under the supervision of BAM. In practice, 
however, it is not always possible to determine how much fuel is 
supplied to subcontractors. In that case BAM accounts for all  
CO2 emissions. 
Waste
The reporting scope includes all waste leaving BAM’s sites and 
offices, mainly based on waste tickets and data provided by 
suppliers. Reported waste is either measured, calculated or 
estimated using reliable methods and input data which can be 
based on BAM’s experience in comparable works. Excavation 
waste and demolition waste are especially difficult to measure and 
are more often calculated.
Construction and office waste consist of temporary and 
permanent (construction) materials and packaging brought on to

9.7 Material themes and management approach  
 
Definition Impact Management approach
Health and safety
Health and safety 
(zero accidents) of 
all employees and 
subcontractors and 
everyone involved 
with BAM’s 
activities, including 
the general public.
‘BAM borrows its employees from their families’, is 
how BAM expresses its responsibility for everyone who 
works with and for BAM. There is nothing more 
important than everyone returning home safely. 
Health and safety at work contribute to the 
satisfaction of the employees of the Group and their 
family members, BAM’s subcontractors, its supply 
partners and others involved in BAM’s construction 
sites. Safety also affects BAM’s clients and BAM’s 
reputation.
BAM has developed a Group-wide guideline for safety 
management. All safety management systems from 
operational companies must comply with this framework.
Meeting the strategy means focusing on the quality of the 
underlying goals: striving for the ambition ‘zero accidents’ 
every day is the goal for safety. Zero accidents mean the 
mindset (intrinsic motivation) and the true belief that it is 
feasible to create a safe working environment that means 
‘everyone returns home safe every day’. 
  For BAM’s performance, see chapter 3.2 Social performance.
Project and product quality and control
Quality of the 
tender process, 
efficient project 
management and 
effective project 
execution with the 
aim to meet or 
exceed the 
expectations of  
the client.
In order to exceed client expectations, BAM must 
continuously improve the experienced performance of 
its products. Product quality means that BAM does 
what it has promised to do, within budget and on 
time. Operational performance is crucial for achieving 
the right level of financial and non-financial results for 
construction projects.
BAM has focused the tender process on the quality of its 
tenders in order to guarantee the current and future 
results of construction projects.
Evaluations of the internal governance framework have 
resulted in the updating of the business principles and 
management guidelines, including the strengthening of 
project selection and BAM’s tender process for large and 
high-risk projects. In connection with this development, 
peer reviews are carried out on project estimates under 
the leadership of the tender desk director.
In order to comply with product responsibility, BAM 
assures that projects where its operating companies are 
responsible for design and construction are certified. In 
other projects (PPP projects) BAM uses verification and 
validation methods. Each operating company has a quality 
manager who is responsible for the quality control of the 
operating company’s processes. System audits are 
conducted by third parties. On all levels, outcomes are 
assessed by the senior management of BAM’s operating 
companies. 
 For BAM’s performance, see chapter 2.2 Strategy and chapter 4 Risk management.

Business conduct and transparency
Openness and 
compliance with 
generally accepted 
standards and 
values and 
compliance with 
local legal and 
other rules and 
regulations, in 
particular regarding 
the acquisition and 
execution of 
contracts.
BAM’s reputation and licence to operate depend on 
responsible business conduct, by stimulating dialogue 
about dilemmas. Ensuring compliance with anti-
corruption legislation improves efficiency through 
lower transaction costs for BAM and its stakeholders. 
Moreover, BAM is of the opinion that doing business 
honestly is of vital importance for the strengthening 
of the competitive position of both BAM and its 
partners. Competitive behaviour contributes to 
innovation and collaboration. It creates an 
environment in which the best products will win and in 
which BAM’s clients will get the best products for the 
best price. The Group believes that by providing 
financial and non-financial information on the 
achievement of BAM’s strategic goals, it can 
continuously improve the reporting process as well as 
its performance.
For BAM, it is fundamental to comply with generally 
accepted standards and values but also with local legal 
and other rules and regulations, particularly with respect 
to the acquisition and performance of contracts. This is set 
out in the Group’s core values, the Code of Conduct and 
adjoining policies such as those relating to bribery, 
corruption and competition. All employees must act 
honestly, comply with agreements and deal carefully with 
customers and business partners, including suppliers and 
subcontractors. The Executive Board encourages this 
compliance, which is continuously evaluated in order to 
make integrity a fundamental part of the daily activities. 
The Group has an enhanced speak-up policy with an 
external reporting line, so that breaches of the code and 
policy can be reported through various channels. This 
policy is easily accessible to employees (e.g. on the 
intranet) and there is frequent communication around the 
themes. Compliance officers monitor compliance and 
advise on integrity issues.
  For BAM’s performance, see chapter 3.2 Social performance.
Financial performance
Overall financial 
health, including 
balance sheet, 
profit and loss, 
property 
divestment and 
working capital 
improvement.
A healthy financial performance provides BAM with 
the means to undertake transactions with its supply 
chain partners, leading to the possibility to develop 
new activities and to pay BAM’s employees and 
shareholders.
Constant attention is paid to strengthening BAM’s balance 
sheet and net results by improving financial processes to 
ensure a solid track record of project execution and 
margin stability, including rigorous monitoring of the cost 
base in line with BAM’s portfolio. Other key elements are 
working capital management and the execution of a 
property divestment programme.
Example KPI: Return on capital employed (ROCE) >10 per cent by 2020.  For BAM’s performance, see paragraph 3.1 Financial 
performance.

Employee recruitment, development and retention
Encourage 
employees to use 
their skills, abilities 
and experience in a 
way that adds value 
to the Company 
and delivers 
personal growth, 
technical 
innovation and 
profit.
BAM increases its intellectual capital and the human 
capital of its stakeholders by investing in employee 
development. Although the impact of the 
development of employees on society in general is 
minimal, it is much greater within BAM, where it 
contributes to the involvement of employees and 
lifelong learning. BAM recognises the importance of 
Group-wide development and implementation of the 
talent strategy and agenda, succession planning and 
internal mobility, based on BAM’s organisational 
development and strategic objectives. Talent 
management allows BAM to attract, develop, 
motivate and retain productive, engaged employees, 
now and in the future. BAM is committed to the 
principles of equal opportunity and diversity. The 
Group believes that diverse teams are better aligned 
with the wishes and expectations of its clients and 
with society in all BAM markets. In line with its vision 
on diversity, BAM wants to attract people with 
different profiles and backgrounds to build teams that 
are suitable for future challenges and will contribute 
to the achievement of BAM’s strategic goals.
The Group’s development approach is aimed at encouraging 
employees to take their development into their own hands, 
with the manager/company taking on a supporting and 
facilitating role. The employee’s personal development is 
recorded in a personal learning and development plan. 
These plans are evaluated regularly between manager and 
employee. BAM offers employees various tools that can be 
used in their personal development, which are all accessible 
via BAM’s intranet Connect. With BAM Learning, BAM offers 
an integrated approach to support employees in achieving 
their professional development goals. The training portfolio 
enables employees to keep up with their professional 
knowledge and to further develop the broader skills related 
to their role and career paths. Courses include topics such as 
integrity, entrepreneurship, commerce, new contract forms, 
project and risk management, procurement and financial 
management. The Group aims to foster an open culture of 
learning and exchanging knowledge in the form of training 
and education, building on the knowledge and expertise 
available within BAM as well as providing on-the-job 
development opportunities. For business and project 
leadership development (including early career), the Group 
has specialised programmes. 
 For BAM’s performance, see chapter 3.2 Social performance.
Energy and emissions
Energy 
consumption for 
BAM’s direct 
activities and the 
entire lifecycle of its 
products, and the 
CO2 emissions as a 
result of this energy 
consumption.
The Group’s energy consumption contributes to a 
significant amount of its costs and is an indicator of 
the efficiency of its processes. The construction 
industry has a high energy consumption compared to 
others; therefore, BAM’s energy use has a major 
impact on society. Climate adaptation and mitigation 
options can help address climate change, but no single 
option is sufficient by itself. Effective implementation 
depends on policies and cooperation from 
governmental bodies. Urgent action is needed to 
significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and 
BAM supports global developments like the UN’s 
Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Agreement, 
the EU Emissions Trading System and the Science 
Based Target Initiative.
BAM innovates and works with value chain partners to 
identify possible reductions in both upstream and 
downstream manufacturing and operational processes.
BAM has calculated its carbon footprint in order to identify 
the main influences and therefore the key areas for 
potential reduction of emissions. The Group has set 
targets for both absolute and relative reduction of 
emissions. BAM monitors and benchmarks progress on 
these targets on a quarterly basis for different activities 
within the Company. The Company focuses on reducing its 
direct CO2 emissions by lowering energy consumption 
during the construction process. The Group also maintains 
its efforts to use higher proportions of renewable energy. 
By joining the Dutch Climate Coalition (Nederlandse 
Klimaat Coalitie), BAM has committed to: 
• Hav
ing climate-neutral operations by 2050; 
• Pro
viding insights into its carbon footprint;
• Set
ting interim targets for climate neutrality; 
•  Bec
oming an ambassador of the Dutch Climate 
Coalition within the construction industry.

Circular economy
An economy which 
aims to keep 
materials, 
components and 
products at their 
highest utility and 
value, at all times.
BAM has a continuous need for raw materials, water 
and energy. This means that primary processes are 
influenced by the increasing volatility of raw materials 
and energy prices. The products made by the Group 
must also comply with current and future 
requirements, with particular attention to the 
significant influence of changing laws and regulations. 
Waste production influences BAM’s licence to operate 
and is an indicator of the efficiency of the business 
processes. In addition, waste products lead to costs 
due to the low value of residual material. 
Approximately 25-30 per cent of the total demolition 
and construction waste in the European Union is 
generated by the construction process. BAM being a 
large construction company, its waste production has 
an impact on society. BAM has identified opportunities 
for innovation based on changing customer requests, 
especially regarding greater attention for the recycling 
of materials and the use of sustainable materials, 
including timber from sustainable forests.
BAM is innovating to reduce material consumption during 
the design process. The Group works with its supply chain 
partners to identify more sustainable alternatives for 
production and operational processes, both upstream and 
downstream. BAM focuses on improving the recycling 
potential of materials and renewable materials by asking 
its most important suppliers to provide insight into their 
origin. 
BAM has set targets for waste reduction, waste recycling 
and responsible sourcing. The Group monitors and 
benchmarks progress on these targets on a quarterly basis 
for various activities within the Company. 
Example KPI: source 100 per cent sustainable timber by 2020.  For BAM’s performance, see paragraph 3.3 Environmental performance.
Community engagement
The relationships 
with the 
communities 
surrounding BAM’s 
activities.
By its very nature, the Group’s construction and 
renovation work has an impact on the local community, 
residents and other users of buildings and 
infrastructure, and society as a whole. Community 
engagement affects the Group’s licence to operate and 
enables BAM to build faster, leading directly to results. 
The Group’s impact on its surroundings immediately 
affects its employees and local suppliers. And BAM’s 
community engagement improves jobs and education 
in its environment, contributing to society as well. This 
requires a constant focus on everything BAM does to 
minimise the Group’s negative impact and create value 
for local communities by implementing community 
engagement programmes. Involvement of people from 
diverse backgrounds provides an opportunity to create 
social value. BAM actively supports social return, 
providing work for people who are unemployed for 
various reasons, for example due to poor education, 
health issues and people with disabilities. Through the 
support of BAM, these people benefit from ‘social 
return on investment’ initiatives.
For many of its projects, BAM identifies local interests and, 
on that basis, chooses the best approach to increase the 
license to operate, which may mean that BAM participates 
in local events. BAM also participates in the Considerate 
Constructors Scheme in the United Kingdom and its Dutch 
equivalent Bewuste Bouwers.
Example KPI: Enhance one million lives in local communities by 2020.  For BAM’s performance, see chapter 3.2 Social performance.

Innovation
The creation of new 
viable business 
offerings.
Innovation influences BAM’s ability to adapt to 
changing market needs and competitiveness in 
relation to current competition and future newcomers 
to the market. Digital construction is a main theme 
within BAM’s innovation agenda. The benefits of 
digital construction for BAM and its stakeholders are 
higher resource productivity, end-user value, 
sustainability and outcome predictability.
BAM shapes its future portfolio over two tracks. Both 
tracks are supported by an organisation and a lively 
ecosystem for innovation (BAMs Innovation Funnel). In 
both tracks BAM focuses strongly on digital innovation.
•  Track
 one, ‘Business innovation’, follows an innovation 
stage gate process to improve and align BAM’s current 
innovation portfolio.
•  Tra
ck two, ‘Scaling edges’, uses scalable learning and 
sprint methodology to develop and scale new business 
offerings at the edges of BAM’s current business. 
  For BAM’s performance, see chapter 2.2 Strategy.
Procurement strategy
Selecting suppliers 
and subcontractors 
and stimulating 
them to practise 
their skills and 
improve their 
products in a way 
that adds long-term 
value to BAM and 
its clients as well as 
suppliers and 
subcontractors, 
providing process 
and product 
innovation and 
profit.
Labour policies of the Group’s suppliers and 
subcontractors can affect BAM’s reputation. Loss of 
reputation can lead to less work. The suppliers and 
subcontractors of the Group must at least adapt their 
policies to the BAM standards in order to be able to 
work for the Company. As a result, these standards 
also have a positive influence outside the Group.
To integrate the development of the Group’s supply chain 
and its values, BAM strives for added-value, long-term, 
mutually beneficial relationships with partners that can help 
to improve the Group’s supply chain. In order to achieve 
this, BAM is developing selected groups of suppliers and 
subcontractors on different levels – unit, operating 
company, country and Group level – within BAM. By having 
a preferred group of suppliers and subcontractors BAM can 
further interact with the supply chain on a regular basis, 
thereby creating the possibility to challenge each other to 
learn, innovate and improve its joint performance for the 
client. Based on the level of the relationship, there are 
different types of suppliers and subcontractors, such as 
preferred suppliers, partners and co-makers. Based on the 
challenges in client markets, development in the supply 
chain and performance of the suppliers and subcontractors, 
the position and role of the suppliers and subcontractors 
can change. The challenge is, on the one hand, to select 
up-front supply chain partners, products and services that 
really make a difference to the value proposition of BAM, 
and on the other hand let go of suppliers and subcontractors 
who do not add value. Apart from a more standardised due 
diligence, suppliers are assessed against five different 
themes: safety, quality, total cost, logistics, and engineering 
and process. If they score below the required level, BAM 
starts a dialogue to improve their performance. If they are 
not willing and/or able to improve their performance, they 
will be excluded from future work with BAM.

letter and spirit of 
tax laws resulting in 
paying an 
appropriate amount 
of tax according to 
where value is 
created within the 
normal course of and 
being transparent 
about approach and 
outcome.
Tax is a relevant subject for BAM and its stakeholders. 
Tax payments to governments can contribute to the 
development of countries. On the other hand, 
optimisation of taxes is in the interest of the Company 
and its financial position.
BAM strives to come to a responsible approach to tax and 
supports paying fair tax as an integral part of its strategic 
agenda.
BAM’s tax policy statement is published on the website 
www.bam.com.

Human rights
Ensuring 
compliance within 
the entire value 
chain regarding the 
basic rights and 
freedoms to which 
all humans are 
entitled, often held 
to include the rights 
to equality, a fair 
trial, freedom from 
slavery, and 
freedom of thought 
and expression.
Human rights is a relevant subject for BAM and its 
stakeholders. The value of rights and freedoms of 
people play an central role in both our direct 
operations as well as in BAM’s mission to create 
sustainable environments. Human rights practices 
within BAM and its supply chain also affect the 
reputation of the Group and are associated with the 
risk of losing the license to operate. The risk of 
violations of human rights as referred to in the 
framework agreement agreed with the international 
federation Building and Wood Worker’s International 
(BWI) are considered highest in some of the countries 
where BAM International operates in, such as in the 
Middle East and Africa.
BAM has signed a framework agreement with Building and 
Wood Worker’s International (BWI), to promote and protect 
employee rights. By signing the agreement BAM agreed to 
recognise and respect:
• The fu
ndamental principles of human rights as defined in 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights;
• The IL
O Declaration on Fundamental Principles and  Rights 
at Work;
• The IL
O Conventions in force;
• The IL
O Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning 
Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy; and
• The O
ECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.
Within the agreement, BAM also endorses the need for fair 
negotiations with national trade unions and acknowledges 
that corruption, bribery and anti-competitive behaviour are 
not acceptable. In the past, regular meetings were held with 
management representatives from BAM and trade union 
organisations (including BWI) and social audits on 
(international) projects were carried out to monitor 
implementation of the agreement. Due to the winding down 
of BAM International and BAM not being able to carry out 
social audits in recent years, the Group will reassess whether 
this is the best approach to cover human rights going forward.
 
Subcontractors must comply with labour conditions as stated 
in BAM’s purchasing conditions. The United Kingdom's 
Modern Slavery Act 2015 requires all larger companies to 
prepare a statement of its activities in this area. Both BAM 
Construct UK and BAM Nuttall have initiated working groups 
and are working towards developing their approaches.
