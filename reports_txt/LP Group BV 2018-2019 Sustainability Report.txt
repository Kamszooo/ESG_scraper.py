There can be no more doubt about the urgent need for 
action to tackle human-made climate change. The United 
Nations has warned that unless we drastically reduce our 
CO2 emissions and reach net zero by 2050, global warming 
will exceed 1.5 degrees, with far-reaching consequences for 
all life on earth.
This is the biggest challenge we face as humanity, and as 
road transport accounts for around 20% of global CO2 
emissions, we’re determined to play our part. That’s why we 
support the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. But we also 
think we can do better. We want to achieve zero tailpipe 
emissions from our entire fleet of 1.8 million vehicles by 2030, 
starting with our employees’ vehicles.
These are ambitious goals, which is why we’ve decided to 
publish this, our first-ever Sustainability Report. We want to 
tell our customers, regulators and other stakeholders how 
our electric vehicle (EV) journey is going and What’s next  
in zero emission mobility. Having set ambitious targets, we 
already have a lot to show, and a clear idea of how we’re 
going to deliver in the years ahead.
For example, in March we launched LeasePlan’s first Green 
Bond Framework, to help us finance and refinance BEVs  
in our fleet. The EUR 500 million bond attracted more than 
EUR 3.5 billion of demand from hundreds of investors.  
It’s a clear signal that the financial markets support our 
sustainability strategy and are an important partner in  
the fight against climate change.
Meanwhile, in our markets, we’re sharpening our EV 
propositions and have created a multi-year roadmap for 
implementation. We’re targeting customers in 12 EV-ready 
countries with attractive EV propositions based on high-
quality services and ‘full package’ solutions, which include 
options for workplace and home charging and 24/7 
assistance. We’re also working with automakers to help 
make these cars more affordable to our customers. Over  
5% of our new vehicle orders are now EVs – a big increase  
on last year.
Internally, we’re also making steady progress in the EV 
transition of our employee fleet to EVs in markets that are 
‘EV ready’. This has meant adjusting our mobility policies, 
installing charging facilities at several of our offices, and 
incentivising our people where possible. In the meantime, 
we continue to offset 100% of CO2 from our employees’ 
vehicles.
But we’re not stopping there. We also work with all 
audiences to help them have a better understanding  
of the benefits of EV adoption. We’re training our 
consultants worldwide to become EV experts, and have 
organised dozens of EV events for our customers and 
published multiple insights and guides, such as our popular 
Sustainable Fleet Benchmark, to help businesses make 
informed decisions about electric driving.

Delivering on zero mobility also means helping to shape 
long-term policies and incentives to support EV technology 
and adoption. Today, LeasePlan is at the heart of the global 
conversation on sustainable mobility through influential 
forums such as the Climate Group’s EV100 initiative, the 
World Economic Forum’s Climate Leaders’ Group and the 
World Business Council for Sustainable Development. 
Together, we’re pressuring policymakers at the national  
and supernational level to implement a level playing field 
for EV incentives and to create a comprehensive public 
charging infrastructure.
Our zero emission mobility activities are only one part of  
our sustainability efforts at LeasePlan. This report contains 
many examples of how we’re also acting as a responsible 
business in the community and in the workplace. For 
example, I’m particularly proud of our new strategy for 
Diversity & Inclusion, which establishes clear actions and 
targets for gender equality. As part of the Talent to the  
Top initiative, our diversity performance will be externally 
monitored on an annual basis. 
For my own part, I’m delighted to be leading such a great 
company at such an exciting time in its history. I’d like to 
thank our customers, suppliers and investors for their 
ongoing trust in us and for their cooperation. I look forward 
to working with them in the future, as we continue to lead 
the transition to What’s next in sustainable mobility.
Sincerely,
Tex Gunning

The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has pointed to the need for ‘rapid, far-reaching 
and unprecedented changes’ to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. To achieve this, it estimates global 
net human-caused emissions of CO2 will need to fall by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, and reach 
net zero by around 2050.
Many in the business community stand ready to support this goal. In an open letter ahead of the 
Climate Change Conference (COP24) in Katowice in November 2018, the World Economic Forum’s 
Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, of which LeasePlan is a member, called on governments to implement 
better carbon pricing mechanisms, take steps to stimulate low-carbon finance and investments, and 
create policy tools to influence demand for low-carbon solutions.
As the fastest-growing contributor to human-caused CO2 emissions worldwide, the transport sector  
is a major focus area. Road transport in the EU alone accounts for around 21% of all carbon emissions9.  
It is also responsible for high levels of pollution, principally nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, that 
impact public health in urban areas. Around half the vehicles on the road in the EU are registered to 
corporate organisations, making businesses key actors in the transition to low- or zero- emission 
mobility.
Accelerating zero emission mobility 
A recent report aimed at policymakers entitled The Ambition Loop shows that businesses can act 
decisively on climate change, provided they are supported by clear public policies and incentives.  
The report, published jointly by the United Nations Global Compact, the We Mean Business coalition 
and the World Resources Institute, shows how effective government policies and guidelines can 
successfully spur businesses into action.
According to the report, some 20 automakers and nearly 20 countries have set targets for electric 
vehicles (EVs) in the past three years. This has led the number of EVs on the road to more than double 
since 2015 and increase six-fold since 2013, with an estimated 3 million vehicles in 2017 and 4 million  
by September 2018. 
The world around us
Our strategy is to deliver What’s Next in sustainable mobility  
in a rapidly changing landscape.

Road emissions are falling 
In the European Union (EU), policies designed to reduce carbon, local pollutants and congestion levels 
have led to great improvements since the Kyoto Protocol of 1992. Significantly, automakers have 
developed new powertrains that have considerably lower emissions of both CO2 and particulate  
matter, helping to tackle climate change and poor urban air quality. 
In 2009, the EU set mandatory fleet-wide average emission reduction targets of 130g CO2/km for new 
passenger vehicles (PVs) by 2015, which manufacturers achieved in 2013, two years ahead of schedule. 
Similarly, a 2011 EU target to reduce fleet-wide average CO2 emissions for new Light Commercial 
Vehicles (LCVs) to no more than 175g CO2/km was reached in 2013, four years ahead of schedule.
Automakers are now preparing for stricter targets. Earlier this year, the EU adopted tougher CO2 
emission performance standards for both new PVs and LCVs. From 2021, the EU fleet-wide average 
emission target for new PVs will be 95g CO2/km, while the average emission target for LCVs will be  
147g of CO2 per kilometre. The EU Parliament and the council has also agreed that, by 2030, emissions 
from new PVs will have to be 37.5% lower and emissions from new LCVs 31% lower, compared to  
2021 levels.

More low-emission zones
In parallel to this activity at supernational level, actions are taking place at municipal level to curb 
dangerous levels of pollutants and ease traffic congestion. In the absence of national legislation, a 
growing number of local authorities are creating Low Emission Zones (LEZs) to meet the obligations  
of the EU Ambient Air Quality Directive. By 2019, there were already more than 250 European cities  
with some form of LEZ in place10, with many more expected in the years to come. 
LEZs restrict the access of certain vehicles or impose a surcharge on drivers every time they enter a defined 
area. Restrictions can be based on fuel, vehicle type or year of registration, but are mostly set by the 
European emission standards for engine types. In the vast majority of cases, Euro 5 standards or higher 
are allowed access (all new vehicles are Euro 6). However, this is likely to change over time as regulations 
become more stringent. LEZs are of growing significance to business drivers, particularly those offering 
last-mile delivery services in LCVs.
EV market tipping point
BEVs and plug-in hybrids are well placed to tackle the combined challenges of climate change and 
poor urban air quality, and allow business, automakers and drivers to significantly reduce or eliminate 
their emissions. Their adoption is also rising rapidly, and in the case of BEVs, the market is believed to be 
fast approaching a tipping point.
An estimated 2 million EVs were sold worldwide in 2018. This is a comparatively small part of the market, 
but a major increase on the few thousand sold in 2010. This growth trend is expected to continue in the 
decades ahead, with annual passenger EV sales forecast to reach some 10 million in 2025, 28 million in 
2030 and 56 million by 204011. Some of the fastest growth in EV adoption is likely to take place in 
markets in which LeasePlan is active.

At the same time, public charging infrastructure has expanded rapidly, although its widespread 
availability remains an important hurdle for comprehensive EV adoption, particularly among drivers 
without access to home or workplace charging. A combination of potential solutions is starting to 
emerge, such as ultra-fast chargers, wireless charging and battery swapping, but making these  
feasible and accessible to all types of drivers must be a strong focus for policymakers and operators  
in the years ahead.
Several factors are driving EV adoption, especially the fall in total cost of ownership, which is already lower 
than diesel equivalents in some European markets, with other markets expected soon. EVs are generally 
forecast to reach price parity with internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles across most segments by the 
mid-2020s12, albeit with some geographic variations. While the European playing field for tax benefits  
and other incentives is uneven, costs will decline largely thanks to continued growth of global battery 
manufacturing capacity and falling lithium-ion battery pack prices, which are expected to continue. 
Global EV sales are expected to significantly increase

For these reasons, we believe the future of zero emission mobility is closer than many people think.  
As our customers look to operate more responsibly and sustainably across their entire value chains,  
we will help them transition to lower and zero emission alternative vehicles.
Another factor broadening the appeal of EVs is the wide range of models that is now available. Most 
major automakers already offer EV models and are expected to have low-emission vehicles across  
most categories in the next few years. As well as the advantages they offer in terms of emissions, 
design, connectivity, interior space and access to LEZs, the next generation of EVs promises to be safer, 
faster to charge and capable of travelling longer distances on a single charge.

In 2018, we analysed the preparedness of 22 European countries 
for the transition to EVs. The result of this research was the 
LeasePlan EV Readiness Index 2019, which we published ahead  
of this year’s World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos.

The countries included in the LeasePlan EV Readiness Index 2019 are listed in the chart below.
The index found that under present-day conditions the EV readiness of our markets varies considerably, 
with Norway, Netherlands, Sweden and Austria the clear frontrunners.
Although some of the remaining countries showed improved preparedness compared to the previous 
year, not all countries are getting ready for the EV transition at the same pace, and some will require 
more time to make the transition. This generally reflects a lack of action by policymakers on key  
EV enablers, such as charging infrastructure, purchase subsidies, registration tax benefits, ownership  
tax benefits, company tax benefits and VAT benefits. 
LeasePlan uses the results of the Index to help guide the transition to zero emission mobility.

CASE STUDY
Inaugural Green Bond 
drives zero emission 
ambition
LeasePlan’s first-ever Green Bond is a new front 
in our strategy to speed up the transition to 
electric driving and help tackle climate change. 
An industry first, the Green Bond is a EUR 500 million five-year fixed rate note 
issued in March 2019, the proceeds of which will only be used to finance the 
purchase of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs).
The successful bond attracted EUR 3.5 billion of demand through the 
participation of around 260 investors, including many responsible investment-
orientated investors*. The level of demand was a clear indication of the 
support from Europe’s institutional investor base for LeasePlan’s sustainability 
strategy to achieve net zero emissions from its total fleet.
“We’re very proud to have introduced this new way of funding our BEV 
ambitions,” says Yolanda Paulissen, Chief Strategic Finance and Investor 
Relations Office. “The Green Bond enables us to tap new investment pools 
and further expand our diversified funding platform, while allowing our 
customers to make sustainable mobility choices.”
By helping us expand our BEV fleet growth, LeasePlan’s Green Bond  
supports the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development 
Goals ‘Good Health and Well-Being’ (SDG 3), ‘Industry, Innovation and 
Infrastructure’ (SDG 9), ‘Sustainable Cities and Communities’ (SDG 11) and 
'Climate Action' (SDG 13). LeasePlan’s Green Bond framework is also aligned 
with the Green Bond Principles** under the ‘clean transportation’ category.
* A s defined by the United Nations – supported Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI)
**
  T
he Battery Electric Vehicles acquired under the LeasePlan Green Bond Framework,  
being ‘zero tailpipe emissions vehicles’, are also recognised as contributing substantially to 
Climate Mitigation under the developing ‘EU Taxonomy of environmentally-sustainable 
economic activities’ (www.ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/business_economy_euro/banking_
and_finance/documents/190618-sustainable-finance-teg-report-taxonomy_en.pdf).  
The Taxonomy is anticipated to form the basis for future green bond issuances aligned  
with the expected EU Green Bond Standard currently under development.

Dear reader, 
At LeasePlan we want to build a future-proof company 
that balances the needs of people, planet and profit. With 
entities in 32 countries, employing 7,500+ employees, serving 
tens of thousands of clients and managing a fleet in excess 
of 1.8 million vehicles, we have a clear responsibility to be 
mindful of our impact. 
To this end, since launching our strategy a year ago, we 
have put sustainability at the heart of our business and 
have begun integrating it into everything we do. Next to our 
ambitions for zero emission mobility, we have introduced 
targets and policies that contribute to societal wellbeing 
and the reduction of our overall environmental impact. 
These are areas our countries have addressed over the 
years, but never as part of a structured and globally 
coordinated approach.
This Sustainability Report 2018/19 is our first stick in the 
ground in this journey. It shows our stakeholders where we 
are today and where we’re heading. It includes the targets 
we’ve set for our performance and how we monitor our 
progress. It also explains how we are focusing our efforts 
on the topics that matter the most for our stakeholders.
We’re proud of our achievements so far, but we know there’s 
still much work to do. For example, we are working hard on 
collecting and consolidating our data for all material topics 
to help us validate our progress. Having top quality data at 
our finger tips is key in our ambition to adopt best practice 
standards in sustainability reporting in 2020. The same is 
true for the clear governance structures and the processes 
we have in place to ensure we remain focused on delivering 
on our ambitions in the years ahead. 
Set on a clear path, LeasePlanners will continue to prove 
that sustainability is a topic close to their hearts. This report 
represents a new way of looking at the world around us,  
at our business partners and wider society, and, ultimately, 
at ourselves. I take this opportunity to thank everyone who 
has helped drive forward our sustainability agenda in the 
past year, and I look forward to working with you in the 
year ahead as we make progress on our goals.

To deliver on our sustainability targets, we have formulated a comprehensive strategy that 
responds to the changes taking place in our industry and the world around us, and which is 
aligned to the broad interests of our stakeholders. 
Launched at the end of 2017, the strategy is based on three priority areas:
1. 
 S
haping the future of low-emission mobility 
2. 
 S
trengthening our contribution to societal wellbeing
3. 
 R
educing our own environmental impact
Each area has been further substantiated by workstreams, each of which has an owner 
from the business. They set baselines, develop action plans, set targets and define KPIs.  
Our strategic process is underpinned by clear governance, consistent reporting and an open 
dialogue with stakeholders to determine the topics that are most material to our business 
(also see Materiality on page 51).

We are committed to taking a leadership role in our industry’s 
transition from internal combustion engines to alternative 
powertrains in support of the Paris Agreement and climate-related 
Sustainable Development Goals. 
This means promoting cleaner, low-emission vehicles and the infrastructure required to make them a 
viable option for our customers and employees. It also requires us to design services and technology-
enabled tools that help managers get the most out of their fleets while reducing harmful emissions.  
In shaping the future of low-emission mobility, we have defined three goals and focus areas:
1.

1.1  Net zero tailpipe emissions  
from total fleet by 2030
As a Founding Partner of the EV100, we have set ourselves the 
goal of achieving net zero tailpipe emissions from our total fleet  
by 2030. We will do this by facilitating the uptake of low and  
zero emission vehicles in our customers’ fleets. 
Our focus is to make low-emission mobility an attractive proposition for our customers. We believe that 
achieving zero emissions is realistic as the EV market will develop rapidly in the years ahead as efforts 
to combat climate change intensify and costs of ownership continue to fall.

To drive this transition, we are targeting customers in 12 EV-ready countries with low-emission value 
propositions. These are based on high-quality operational services, and include ‘full package’ solutions 
with charging options. We are also partnering with automakers to make sure we can offer low-emission 
vehicles at a competitive price, while looking to address challenges around the residual value of 
low-emission vehicles.
Roadmap to net zero 
Our transition roadmap can be broadly divided into three stages that correspond to anticipated 
developments in the overall EV market. 
1. 
 20
17-2020: Walk the talk 
Through our strategic partnerships, we build compelling EV propositions, including charging services,  
in EV-ready countries. We work closely with automakers to maximise the number of EVs in our fleet  
and stimulate demand via events, marketing campaigns and consultancy services for our customers. 
2. 
 2
020-2025: Accelerate 
As automakers ramp up EV production volumes, new models reach the market across all segments. 
Total costs of ownership become competitive in most markets as battery costs fall. Government 
incentives and new low-emission zones spur growing customer demand for EV fleets. There is now a  
full EV product line-up available at an acceptable cost, while the availability of charging infrastructure 
at home, workplace and in public places is being ramped up, including ultra-fast highway-charging. 
During this period, we expect to see EVs accounting for a majority of our new orders in EV-ready 
markets, while less mature markets show signs of high growth, but from a low base.
3. 
 2
025-2030: Net zero 
Most major automakers now have a full line-up of EVs. Developments in battery technology have 
greatly reduced ‘range anxiety’ and supply is sufficient to meet demand. Government legislation is  
also strongly incentivising adoption. As a result, the total cost of ownership of EVs is lower than for  
ICEs in most markets. Infrastructure in EV-ready markets is mature enough to charge EVs at all times 
necessary. The first of our mature markets will reach zero emissions by the beginning of the period,  
while less mature markets catch up.

We have also introduced the possibility of carbon-neutral contracts through our partnership with  
Land Life Company. Under the partnership, LeasePlan can help customers offset their fleet emissions 
through an innovative reforestation programme. Land Life Company is a leader in the sustainable  
and technology-driven reforestation of degraded land in the EU and US.
New orders of EVs
The composition of our fleet is rapidly changing. EVs18 accounted for 5.7% of all our new vehicle orders 
in Q2 2019.
Other activities
To give our customers and drivers a better understanding of EV advantages and requirements, 
LeasePlan has launched a series of educational initiatives. We organised client events, visits and pilot 
programmes to help clients start their electric journeys. We also published a wide range of information 
about EVs through online and offline channels. These included whitepapers on electric LCV adoption, 
and our Sustainable Fleet Benchmark, which offers insights into how organisations are adopting 
low-emission fleets.
In early 2019 we successfully issued our first-ever Green Bond, a EUR 500 million five-year fixed rate  
note. An industry first, the proceeds from the Green Bond will only be used to finance or refinance the 
purchase of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), speeding up the transition to electric driving and helping  
to tackle climate change (also see page 16 of this report).

Raising EV awareness  
in France
LeasePlan France has deployed an ambitious  
‘Start Electric’ strategy to support the local 
transition to electric driving.
The plan will position LeasePlan as a leader in sustainable fleet management 
by raising EV awareness among business customers, and making sure 
commercial and consultancy teams are ready to meet growing demand.
Start Electric France allows customers to test drive the latest EV models, 
familiarise themselves with charging solutions and learn more about  
EV fleet strategies. It reinforces LeasePlan’s commitment to achieving net  
zero emissions from its total fleet, and helps start credible discussions with 
customers about their own targets and ambitions. 
“We’ve developed a very good understanding of the roadblocks that big 
companies face when switching to EVs, and how to best help them begin 
their transitions,” says Olivier Debuquoy, EV consultant. “Cost of ownership  
is still the first challenge, but that gap is steadily closing and business interest  
is on the rise.”
Increased government incentives and rising competition between local 
automakers bringing more EV models onto the market are likely to fuel 
further demand in 2020, Olivier explains. “If 2019 was the time when most of 
the automotive industry joined us on the starting grid, we think that 2020 will 
definitely be the start of the race!” 
As part of Start Electric France, the team has also organised numerous 
e-learnings and training sessions for employees, along with test drives and 
talks by representatives of many automakers. To demonstrate its new service 
offering, 22 new EV chargers were installed at its head offices at the 
beginning of the year, and another four at the CarNext.com delivery store  
in Venissieux.

1.2  Transition own fleet  
to BEVs by 2021
We intend to ‘walk the talk’ on BEV adoption by transitioning our 
own employee fleet to BEVs by 2021. During the transition, we will 
offset our global employee fleet’s CO2 tailpipe emissions to zero.
Knowing how to help fleet managers make their journeys towards a zero emission mobility future 
begins by having a deep understanding of the challenges they may face. That is why we set ourselves 
the ambitious goal of transitioning our own employee fleet to BEVs by 2021. This approach enables  
us to lead by example, while learning how to help our customers have a smooth transition.

19.   B ased on results of the LeasePlan EV Readiness Index 2019
Strategic implementation
In evaluating the EV readiness19 of our 32 countries from an employee fleet perspective, we estimate  
13 LeasePlan countries are ready to allow full BEV adoption across the local employee fleet by 2021. 
Combined, these countries represent approximately 64% or 1,800 of LeasePlan’s total employee fleet. 
The remaining countries will move at a slightly slower pace, making the final transition to EVs as soon as 
market readiness permits. 
EV-ready markets
The markets we consider to be more EV-ready are: Norway, Netherlands, Sweden, Austria, Finland, 
Germany, United Kingdom, Portugal, Belgium, Luxembourg, Ireland, France, and Switzerland. We have 
begun rolling out transition plans in these markets led by dedicated EV ambassadors. It is worth noting 
that even less mature countries are adding BEVs to their fleet. 
In each case, we have started with communication to explain our mission. We are now adjusting our 
local mobility policies to ensure EV orders replace ICE orders at the appropriate rate. 
In addition, we are:
 • A
rranging for charging facilities near our offices and at employees’ homes
 • P
artnering with automotive suppliers to ensure the best deals are available 
 • C
arefully managing costs to ensure parity with ICEs where possible.
Approximately 36% of our employee fleet is located in countries with lower levels of EV maturity. To  
help speed up the transition in these markets, we are implementing local and group-wide actions to 
significantly reduce fleet emissions until such time as the EV transition can be fully made. These include 
partnerships with automakers and, where appropriate, EV advocacy in local governmental discussions.
Offsetting to zero
In 2017, we began offsetting the CO2 emissions of our global employee fleet with the support of the 
Land Life Company. A total of 8.83 tonnes was offset in 2017, while 8.26 tonnes was offset in 2018. 
Although we strive for zero tailpipe emissions from our fleet, we acknowledge that until a full transition 
to EVs can be completed, emissions will be generated that will need to be offset.

CASE STUDY
 
Netherlands walks the 
talk in EV transition
LeasePlan Netherlands has embarked on a 
decisive strategy to transition its entire employee 
fleet to EVs as fast as possible, and well ahead  
of LeasePlan’s 2021 goal. 
In less than two years, EVs already account for nearly 90% of its employee 
fleet, an achievement the team are hugely proud of. 
“We understood that if we wanted our customers to start their EV journeys, 
then we had to set a strong example ourselves,” explains Erik Henstra, 
Managing Director of LeasePlan Netherlands. “So we decided to accelerate  
our transition as much as possible. As the largest leasing company in the 
Netherlands, we also feel it's our responsibility to show the way forward.”
Their strategy has involved the rapid phasing out of new non-EV orders, and 
large-scale changes to the mobility policy. Car categories and terms were 
also adjusted to give employees a wide selection of EV models to choose 
from, while home chargers were installed at employee homes wherever 
possible, and more were made available at local offices. 
The transition was not without its challenges, and not all employees were 
initially supportive. LeasePlan went to great lengths to provide support and 
greater comfort levels, especially to those whose work required them to travel 
long distances by car. 
Erik believes the transition has been an invaluable experience that helps  
LeasePlan Netherlands to advise customers on their own EV plans. Looking 
ahead to its 100% EV future, LeasePlan Netherlands has begun plans to bring 
leased e-bikes to the market in 2020. 
A big part of LeasePlan Netherland’s employee transition strategy has been to 
make more charging facilities available at local offices.

Tackling climate- and air-quality related automotive 
emissions requires a cross-sector effort from government, 
NGOs and the private sector, acting together to address 
challenges in several areas. A focus in our sustainability 
strategy is therefore to work with key stakeholder  
groups — automakers, policymakers, consumers and 
mobility companies — to advocate the implementation of 
consistent, cost-effective, long-term policies and incentives 
that support the adoption of low-emission technologies.
Our global advocacy programmes and initiatives include:
EV100
Organised by The Climate Group, the EV100 global  
business initiative is designed to fast-track the uptake of 
electric vehicles and infrastructure among large global 
corporations. LeasePlan is a founding partner of EV100, 
which was launched around the UN General Assembly  
in 2017, and is the initiative’s only automotive company.  
EV100 is the only initiative of its kind to encourage global 
business commitments on electric transport, with members 
committing to transition their petrol and diesel fleets to 
electric vehicle fleets by 2030.
The Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) 
Challenge
In 2019, LeasePlan became a founding partner of the Zero 
Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Challenge, a new global coalition 
organised by The Climate Group and the C40 Cities Climate 
Leadership Group. The ZEV Challenge brings together 
states, regions, cities, businesses and NGOs to send a clear 
signal to the automotive industry about increasing demand 
for EVs. Partners develop and advocate policies and 
solutions to spark mass EV adoption. In its first year, over  
60 states and cities and businesses have committed to  
the targets. 
They represent a population of over 237 million, while the 
businesses account for a combined revenue of over half a 
trillion US dollars. As a founding partner, LeasePlan uses its 
policy influence and customer relationships to accelerate 
adoption among some of the world’s largest businesses. 
World Economic Forum (WEF)
Global leaders representing more than 1,800 organisations 
gather each year at the World Economic Forum’s Annual 
Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, to exchange ideas, tackle 
the big issues of the day, and plan for a better future. 
LeasePlan has been present at the WEF since 2018 where  
it supports discussions on the transition to low-emission 
mobility. In that same year, LeasePlan CEO Tex Gunning 
was designated Automotive Sector Champion for the  
WEF’s Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders.
LeasePlan aims to bring the latest market research and 
insights to the WEF. In 2018, we published our first 
Sustainable Fleet Benchmark ahead of the event to help 
raise awareness around the adoption of sustainable fleet 
management practices. In 2019, we published our new  
EV Readiness Index to help global corporations with 
international fleets identify the most suitable markets to 
begin their transitions to low-emission mobility. 
In 2019, LeasePlan participated in various sessions at the 
WEF Annual Meeting in Davos. LeasePlan CEO Tex Gunning 
joined panel discussions on ‘Building a Clean Mobility 
Future’ and ‘Electric Vehicle Future: The Power of Fleets’  
to help explore conditions, strategies, and policies for 
accelerating EV adoption. We also hosted a private dinner 
for business leaders to discuss strategies for last-mile 
delivery that address concerns around air quality, climate 
change and congestion.
1.3  Advocating change in our industry
We use our scale, expertise and broad geographic presence  
to be at the heart of the discussion on the transition to  
low-emission mobility.

World Business Council for 
Sustainable Development
The World Business Council for Sustainable Development 
(WBCSD) comprises almost 200 forward-thinking global 
companies that are committed to advancing the 
sustainability agenda. LeasePlan joined the WBCSD in 2018 
to explore innovative solutions for low-emission mobility 
together with partners in the network. Together with the 
other WBSCD members, LeasePlan has developed the 
Corporate EV Adoption Guide. This brings together practical 
experiences and expertise in EV fleet transitions from a wide 
range of perspectives and presents them in an easy to 
navigate online guide.
The United Nations Climate Change 
Conference 
The annual conferences of the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) serve as the 
formal meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP). The 
COP is the decision-making body that assesses progress 
made in dealing with climate change. In the mid-1990s it 
negotiated the Kyoto Protocol to establish legally binding 
obligations for developed countries to reduce their 
greenhouse gas emissions, and the Paris Agreement in 2015, 
to limit global temperature rises. 
LeasePlan announced the launch of its electric vehicle pilot 
programme for corporate companies in 2017 at COP23 in 
Bonn, Germany. Ahead of the 2018 COP24 in Katowice, 
Poland, LeasePlan was a signatory of an open letter  
by the WEF’s Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, calling  
on governments to implement effective carbon pricing 
mechanisms; stimulate low-carbon finance and 
investments through coherent policies; and develop  
policy tools to educate and influence societal demand.

CASE STUDY
Portugal embraces its 
zero emissions future
EV adoption in Portugal is growing rapidly 
thanks in part to government policies and tax 
incentives that promote electric driving among 
local businesses and public bodies. 
Despite continued obstacles, such as the insufficient availability of public 
charging infrastructure, LeasePlan Portugal’s largest customers are reporting 
an ever-stronger interest in EVs for their fleets. 
“We see a massive opportunity for EVs in Portugal,” says António Oliveira 
Martins, Managing Director, LeasePlan Portugal. “In fact, we think the entire 
Car-as-a-Service industry here is going to benefit from the switch to zero 
emission mobility.”
LeasePlan Portugal launched its EV strategy in 2010 when the first electric 
models reached the market. Its focus then was to acquaint customers with 
the options and help them make better informed EV decisions for their fleets. 
It organised EV events, presentations, test drives, competitions and published 
numerous guides and whitepapers.
“Portugal’s become an early EV adopter within Europe, despite being a 
relatively small country,” António explains. “We’re very proud that LeasePlan  
is on the frontline of this change and is a reference point in the market. It is 
because of how seriously we’ve taken our commitments.” 
António says LeasePlan Portugal recently updated its EV strategy to increase 
the appeal of its EV offer. The strategy includes offering integrated charging 
solutions, establishing strategic partnerships, and creating special deals  
for smaller businesses.
LeasePlan Portugal Managing Director António Oliveira Martins speaks  
at the ‘Towards Zero Emissions in 2030’ conference organised by LeasePlan.

Values and ethics
As one of the world’s largest Car-as-a-Service companies and an employer of over 7,500  
people, we have a responsibility to apply high standards in our personal conduct and  
day-to-day business decisions. We therefore work to ensure our values and ethics are  
embedded in our behaviour, processes and actions.
Our values and ethics are defined by the LeasePlan Code of Conduct (www.leaseplan.com/ 
corporate/site-services/code-of-conduct), which also explains the way we deal with each  
other, customers, suppliers, society at large, government authorities, regulators, investors  
and business partners. The core values we uphold are Commitment, Expertise, Passion and  
Respect, which we apply to everything we do.
Human rights
We recognise that human rights are fundamental and universal. We aim to respect human  
rights, as described in the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the  
principles of the International Labour Organization. We therefore avoid being complicit in  
human rights abuses of any kind, and condemn the use of forced labour, compulsory labour  
and child labour. Respect for human rights is also a key feature of our Supplier Code of Conduct  
(www.leaseplan.com/corporate/news-and-media/download-centre).

2.1 Employees
At LeasePlan we believe ‘you cannot grow a business,  
you can only grow people who can grow the business’.
We drive success by giving our people opportunities to 
develop their potential and creating a tolerant and inclusive 
environment in which they can thrive. The LeasePlan People 
Strategy helps us achieve this by establishing solid global 
foundations for best practices in personal and professional 
development, talent and performance management, 
competency frameworks and job family modelling.
Our People Strategy is based on four pillars:
1. S
trengthen our leadership: develop a highly effective 
leadership culture, with a pipeline of great people to 
meet our future needs.
2. P
ersonal growth: build the digital skills and 
competencies we will need across the organisation  
in the years ahead.
3. E
ffective compensation and benefits: create a high 
degree of ownership and responsibility by recognising 
and rewarding excellent performance.
4. T
alent management: help our people reach their  
full potential by developing a digital and pro-active 
mindset, and offering them the opportunities and 
support to reach the next level in their careers.
Our aim is to develop a fact-based way of working in which 
people can take responsibility for their careers and are 
empowered to be innovative and creative. To achieve  
this we recently established a new global performance 
management process based on clear ownership and 
transparency. This process, which is entirely cloud-based, 
enables us to have ongoing and meaningful discussions 
with our employees, and to better align their goals with 
those of our overall business. 
Using our performance management system as a 
foundation, we are also helping our people develop the  
skills and competencies they need to thrive in today’s  
highly competitive and disruptive digital environment. In  
this context, we are also taking decisive steps to accelerate 
re-skilling and upskilling across our organisation globally. 
For example, we recently invested in a widely recognised 
external service that provides access to more than 13,000 
high-quality online courses, including certified courses 
taught by industry experts in software, creative and 
business skills. This service is available to all our employees 
around the world, in multiple languages, and can be 
accessed from any wireless device. 
At the same time, we have continued to expand our 
‘Leadership Journeys’ programme. This has now reached 
some 1,300 employees worldwide, helping them to have  
a better understanding of themselves, their colleagues,  
and what is required of them to deliver What’s next. Our 
Leadership Journeys are instrumental to our ambition  
to develop a highly effective leadership culture by 
empowering our leaders to make an impact, while building 
a pipeline of great people to meet our needs in the future.

Employee base
Our global employee base totalled 7,55722 at the end  
of June 2019. Of this number, approximately 52% were  
male and 48% were female. For layers A, B, C, the gender 
distribution is approximately 70.5% and 29.5% for men  
and women respectively.
While LeasePlan has a relatively strong balance of gender 
diversity, we recognise there is still considerable room for  
us to improve. We are determined to take strong steps to 
improve our diversity and inclusion in the years ahead and 
have developed a comprehensive strategy that will help us 
achieve this (see Diversity & inclusion below).
Engagement
Employee engagement has been a constant and important 
focus throughout our transformation process, and in June 
2019 we conducted our annual Global Engagement and 
Integrity Survey.
Our overall global engagement plus score has risen from 
66% in 2018 to 79.5% in 2019. In addition, more LeasePlan 
employees took the time to share their views this year,  
with the response rate increasing by 7% to 87%.
Beyond the headline figure, some areas showed significant 
improvement, such as leadership performance, which rose 
from 69% last year to 77% this year. Other areas (goals and 
strategy, organisational capability) showed smaller rises but 
also improved. 
In addition, most of our employees: 
 • S
upport our organisational goals (86.9%)
 • F
eel their opinions matter (71.7%)
 • F
eel goals are clear (78.4%)
 • F
eel they are a good fit for the organisation (83.1%)
 • F
eel positive about direct managers (82.3%)
Areas requiring more attention:
 • O
pportunities to grow and develop professionally (57.1%)
 • A
ctions taken quickly after decisions have been made 
(47.4%)
 • C
ooperation between different teams/departments 
(45.3%) 
Following the publication of the results, managers across 
LeasePlan arranged meetings with their teams to discuss 
the results, identify opportunities for improving engagement 
and to develop an action plan.
Diversity & inclusion
We are committed to building a culture in which everyone 
can be themselves and where everyone has an equal 
chance to make their journey count, regardless of race, 
nationality, gender, age or sexual orientation. We also 
believe that a diverse workforce, including one that is 
gender diverse, contributes to a well-balanced decision-
making process and the proper functioning of our 
organisation. Fresh ideas, different perspectives and 
valuable experiences all help us to make better decisions 
and meet our customers’ demand for innovative services.
Having recently updated our Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) 
policy, we have developed a comprehensive D&I strategy  
to facilitate the recruitment of employees from diverse 
backgrounds, feedback training for non-biased behaviour, 
and D&I communication. The strategy is based on three 
pillars, and we are in the process of defining actions and 
targets as outlined in the table on page 36.
To help us implement the strategy, we are rolling out a 
number of initiatives under the umbrella of ‘None of us is as 
smart as all of us’. These include a global D&I governance 
structure comprising local teams from across the business  
to help drive local implementation; dedicated trainings, 
e-learnings, awards and communication activities designed 
to instil a diverse culture; and online and offline platforms  
to share best practices and ideas.

CASE STUDY
Sustainable community 
development in India
Since 2006, volunteers from LeasePlan India have 
supported a wide range of initiatives managed 
by local NGOs dedicated to sustainable 
community development and empowerment.
For the past two years, much of LeasePlan India’s community focus has  
been on two schools located near its office in Gurugram. Despite being 
located in the heart of the city, the two schools lacked basic infrastructure, 
such as drinking water, clean toilets, tables and chairs, which resulted in  
fewer admissions and higher dropout rates.
Since the start of the programme, LeasePlan volunteers have worked 
alongside local schoolchildren to help them improve their school 
infrastructure and protect the surrounding natural environment. Typical 
activities included planting trees and vegetable gardens, helping to build and 
repair school facilities, and raising funds through bake sales and donations.
Since the start of the programme, employees have built toilets, repainted the 
school buildings, and contributed to providing water coolers to the schools, 
thereby giving access to clean drinking water to over 200 schoolchildren. 
They have also made the schools part of their tree plantation drives, which 
have resulted in more than 1,500 trees being planted. 
“Community engagement is very important to everyone here at LeasePlan 
India,” explains Sahil Chopra, Manager. “Every visit to one of the schools has 
been a humbling experience for us. It makes us appreciate our own good 
fortune, and motivates us to do more for the community. All our people are 
given one paid day each year to support any external charity of their 
choosing, and this makes us very proud to work for LeasePlan.”
School children and volunteers from LeasePlan India join forces to improve  
a school’s infrastructure and the surrounding environment.

More than 1.35 million people die in road traffic accidents each year, according to the World Health 
Organization (WHO)’s Global status report on road safety 2018. Traffic injuries are now the leading killer 
of people between the ages of 5 and 29. This burden is disproportionately borne by pedestrians, cyclists 
and motorcyclists, especially those in developing countries.
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has set a target (goal 3.6) to halve the global number  
of deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents by 2020. A further target (goal 11.2) includes a focus  
on safe, sustainable transport systems to improve road safety, with special attention on children and 
vulnerable groups. 
Our aim is to contribute to these goals by helping to make our customer and employee fleets among the 
safest in the industry. To achieve this, we are monitoring the portion of vehicle accidents that result in 
bodily injuries to our drivers or to third parties. In 2018, the Bodily Injury Rate (BIR) was 1.2% based on data 
from 10 European countries. In 2020, we intend to capture this data from at least 20 countries. 
All vehicle accidents, from minor scratches all the way to severe damage, are reported as ‘damage events’ 
to LeasePlan from its insured fleet. Approximately 45% of the global serviced fleet is insured via LeasePlan. 
The portion of insured vehicles that report a ‘damage event’ is expressed as the Accident Frequency Rate 
(AFR). In 2018, the AFR averaged 68% for the customer fleet.
One of the most effective ways in which LeasePlan can help to improve safety among its customer and 
employee fleets is by implementing a dedicated programme to help change and improve driver 
behaviours, thereby demonstrably reducing their AFR. .
2.2 Driver safety
Beyond our commitment to maintaining our vehicles to  
the highest standards, our aim is to make our customer  
and employee fleets among the safest in the industry. 
LeasePlan Brazil raises awareness around safety by experimenting  
with augmented reality to simulate the effects of drunk driving.

The Active Prevention programme includes the setting-up of a dedicated Safety Board at client level to 
establish targets and monitor progress; collecting and processing quantitative and qualitative data to 
help understand the root causes of accidents; and using claims data to benchmark accident frequency  
levels and identify high risk areas. This process allows us to define a set of bespoke preventive measures

Implementing Active Prevention
Our dedicated programme to help customers measurably lower their fleet’s AFR is called Active 
Prevention. This programme is part of our 3D Coverage insurance proposition, which is available across 
all countries, and is based on a five-step approach tailored to the circumstances of each customer.

Page 42:
With Active Prevention customers not only increase safety for their drivers, over time, they also  
benefit from lower insurance premiums, fuel costs, CO2 emissions and increased business continuity.  
A structured insurance renewal discussion is a key element of the programme, so that customers  
receive tangible benefits once the accident frequency is reduced.
Active Prevention is currently being promoted among large international customers. 
Distracted driving
A significant portion of car accidents are linked to phone use behind the wheel. A number of LeasePlan 
countries have therefore launched driver safety campaigns among customers and employees to 
discourage drivers from using their mobile phones while driving. 
Driver safety apps can warn drivers against improper, unsafe hand-held phone use, and encourage 
safer, more responsible driving habits. We believe this is a smart way to reduce distractions for drivers, 
which also offers insights for fleet managers through online reporting.
Telematics
In-vehicle telematics enables the analysis of certain data relating to mileage, fuel use and maintenance. 
This can help us reduce fuel use and manage maintenance costs in our fleet more efficiently. In 2019, 
LeasePlan had over 204,600 vehicles equipped with telematic devices.
A LeasePlan customer pilot study demonstrated that accident frequency rates fell on average by 42% 
between 2015-2017 following the implementation of the Active Prevention programme, as shown in the 
graph below.

Diversity & inclusion  
frontrunners in Mexico
Following a rigorous evaluation process, in 2018 
LeasePlan Mexico retained its Gold-level 
certificate for its Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) best 
practices by specialist accreditation company 
BAS International Certification. 
LeasePlan originally received this recognition in 2016, when it become the 
first-ever company in Mexico to achieve Gold-level accreditation for D&I 
practices. 
The certification requires companies to have robust D&I policies in place; 
demonstrate unbiased recruitment and selection processes; guarantee fair 
remuneration and benefits practices; create D&I awareness and training;  
and have mechanisms to prevent and sanction discrimination. 
To support its activities, LeasePlan Mexico has created a dedicated D&I 
Committee, which coordinates initiatives, reviews progress and helps  
towards the sharing of best practices from other companies in the LeasePlan 
organisation. The Committee also has an open mandate to address any 
D&I-related issues that arise in recruitment, performance management

CASE STUDY
LeasePlan Bank goes 
back to school 
For the second year running, LeasePlan Bank 
joined a nationwide initiative to help Dutch 
school children learn to manage money 
responsibly. 
Enthusiastic LeasePlan employees volunteered to be guest lecturers to some 
225 students aged between 9 and 12 at primary schools in their 
neighbourhoods.
The ‘Bank for the Classroom’ programme aims to help children become more 
financially aware at an early age as a basis for greater financial self-reliance 
later in life. It is a collaboration between 17 Dutch banks and the initiative was 
rolled out to some 120,000 children in 2019.
Under this year's theme of ‘Are you a hero with money?’ our guest teachers 
gave a Cash Quiz which included an instructive online money game to help 
children find out what ‘money personality’ they have. Do they spend or save? 
Do they compare the different prices of things? 
“Volunteering as a guest teacher was a great experience!” said Kevin Wetzel, 
Marketing Manager at LeasePlan Bank. “The kids really enjoyed playing the 
quiz and they were very keen to learn more about money and my job at 
LeasePlan Bank. I would definitely encourage my colleagues to participate  
in this programme next year.” 
LeasePlan volunteers brought the ‘Bank for the Classroom’ initiative to some 225 Dutch 
school children in 2019.

The LeasePlan Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC), which was 
updated in 2018, establishes the minimum standards we 
expect our suppliers to adhere to with regards to corporate 
responsibility and customer focus. The Code cannot address 
every conceivable situation our suppliers may face, but it 
does outline the main principles of ethical business conduct 
that we expect suppliers to abide by when working with, 
for, or on behalf of LeasePlan. Our Supplier Code of Conduct 
is focused on the following specific areas:
 • H
onesty and trust
 • R
espect for the law
 • H
uman rights
 • R
esponsibility to employees
 • E
nvironmental sustainability
 • C
onfidentiality and intellectual property
 • P
rivacy of individuals and data protection
 • F
air competition
 • C
onflicts of interest
 • B
ribery prevention
The Supplier Code of Conduct is imbedded in our 
contractual agreements, covering currently 90% of our 
spend, and targeting 100% over time. 
Screening and monitoring
We aim to establish ongoing dialogues with our key 
suppliers, so as to gain a better understanding of their 
sustainability targets and ambition, and to identify areas  
of potential collaboration. 
Our current supplier compliance monitoring is limited to 
anti-money laundering schemes and sanctions using Lexis 
Nexis. By 2020, we intend to implement an Environmental 
Social Governance (ESG) screening of key suppliers to gain 
deeper insights into their activities, assess their level of  
ESG maturity and shape our next steps accordingly.  
We also intend to develop supplier evaluation modules 
embedded in our new digital procurement roadmap.  
This will include tools to monitor adherence to our Supplier 
Code of Conduct during the supplier selection process.
2.3 Suppliers and customers
Conducting our business according to high ethical standards  
is vital to winning and retaining the trust placed in us by our 
stakeholders. We expect our suppliers to reflect the values and 
behaviours that apply within our organisation by conducting  
their own business activities in an ethical manner.

Customer satisfaction 
Customer satisfaction is one of our key objectives and  
as such is a main focus for all LeasePlan employees.  
We measure on a regular basis the satisfaction of both 
customers and drivers. For drivers, we have regular surveys 
in place that allow us to understand how service is delivered 
on an individual basis. We also analyse satisfaction trends 
to get a more in-depth view of company performance and 
areas of improvement. In addition, we recently invested in 
enhancing our ability to monitor and respond to feedback 
on social media. During 2019, we developed a new Voice of 
the Customer programme with the target of increasing 
response levels from customers and drivers. All customer 
feedback is aggregated at a global level, enabling us to 
establish annual improvement plans across the company. 
Customer screening
As a responsible company, LeasePlan will only do business 
with companies that live up to our ethical standards in their 
own operations. We are investigating how we can make 
ESG screening a part of the customer onboarding process.

As a responsible company and member of the community, we organise a variety of activities at a local 
level including volunteering, staff donations and fundraisings in support of multiple social causes. These 
range from helping the homeless and underprivileged, to supporting cancer research and children in 
need. We usually coordinate these activities through established charities.
Coordinating our efforts globally
More recently, we have begun planning a number of global community programmes to scale our 
impact around areas that are close to the heart of LeasePlan employees, including low-emission 
mobility, social inclusion and minimising environmental impact. These plans are still at an early stage, 
but may include a new volunteering programme whereby employees take paid leave to support  
select charities.
2.4 Communities
Every year, LeasePlan and its employees across 32 countries 
actively support a wide range of local social and community 
initiatives.

Community pride  
and purpose in the USA
Every year, LeasePlan USA and its employees 
support nine selected charities through 
volunteering, fund raising and donations. 
All the charities are active in the local community, focusing mainly on helping 
vulnerable or disadvantaged children, or on environmental protection. 
“Every charity we work for is chosen annually by dedicated committees at our 
offices near Atlanta and Chicago, as part of the country’s ‘LeasePlan Cares’ 
initiative,” says Alanna Mohone, SVP Human Resources at LeasePlan USA. 
“Our people really appreciate working for a company that has strong values. 
In fact, we’d like everyone to donate some time to community work, even if  
it’s just a couple of hours. For us, doing the right thing translates to strong 
engagement levels and great morale.” 
As Alanna explains, LeasePlan USA encourages its 530 employees to be 
actively involved in charitable work, offering up to two fully paid days to  
any employee volunteering for a LeasePlan charity or a registered charity  
of their choice. 
“At a country level, LeasePlan USA centrally supports Ronald McDonald House 
Charities. This group of charities provide temporary homes at little or no cost 
to families that have travelled far to get treatment for their seriously ill or 
injured children,” says Alanna.

 • Wa
ste:  Reduce the use of disposable products and

 • P
rocuring products & services:  Make sustainability  
part of the decision making process.
We have also begun to globally assess our energy 
consumption with a view to establishing accurate baseline 
metrics and transitioning to suppliers of renewable energy 
wherever possible. 
We have also established the following group-wide targets:
 • R
educe average energy usage in LP buildings by 10% 
between 2019 and 2022 compared to 2018 levels
 • I
ncrease the share of renewable energy used by 10% 
between 2019 and 2022 compared to 2018 levels
To achieve these targets, we have begun monitoring and 
assessing our electricity use in kwh per annum relative to 
our building space in square metres, and the overall share  
of energy consumption that comes from renewable sources. 
We are still in the process of completing this picture and aim 
to have full insight for our next CDP submission in 2020.

Non-financial disclosure
We are committed to transparency towards our stakeholders, with our activities focused on three  
main areas:
1 Ma
naging sustainability at LeasePlan globally: we have developed a clear governance 
structure to make sure sustainability is addressed at all layers of our organisation 
2
 T
arget setting and monitoring: for each value stream we have set baseline targets, KPIs  
and action plans
3 D
isclosure and reporting: enhance our sustainability disclosure and gradually adopt best 
practices in reporting, including General Reporting Initiative (GRI), Task Force on Climate-Related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD), Integrated Reporting, and our participation in the Carbon Disclosure 
Project (CDP)
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
The UN Sustainable Development Goals address the most important economic, social, environmental 
and governance challenges of our time. We believe business can play a key role in achieving these goals 
by conducting responsible business operations, introducing new business models, and investing in 
innovation and new market opportunities.
The most significant and relevant SDGs that we can address are shown below. We will chart our journey 
to implementing these goals in the relevant non-financial disclosures.

In late 2018, we conducted a formal materiality exercise with our key stakeholders – employees 
worldwide, suppliers and international clients – to validate our sustainability agenda and ensure we 
appropriately address the topics our stakeholders deem most relevant. 
The materiality process broadly comprised three steps:
Step 1: Identifying relevant topics
We assessed the non-financial topics most relevant to our sector by first creating a long list of over  
300 possible material topics. This process took into account various frameworks, input from our 
customers, supply chain partners and our strategy. The primary goal of this exercise was to make sure 
no topics were overlooked. We then shortlisted a selection of these topics, which we validated via 
internal consultation.
Step 2: Determine priorities
A list of identified topics and definitions was presented to our key stakeholder groups via online  
survey, including 70 suppliers, 1,000 customers and all LeasePlan employees. A total of 303 stakeholders 
completed the survey and we determined the most relevant topics for LeasePlan on this basis.  
The CSR Steering Committee has looked at the topics and determined where LeasePlan can have  
the biggest impact on the wider society
Step 3: Creation and final validation
The final results of the materiality exercise were presented in the final LeasePlan materiality matrix.  
This will form the basis for the implementation of relevant policies, target setting and KPI definition, 
and helps us monitor and report on progress.
Determining materiality
By assessing materiality, we can understand the topics that  
our stakeholders deem relevant, where we can have the most 
impact and how we can enhance our existing efforts.

forward. It should be noted that, as topics are positioned relative to one another, all 19 topics are considered to be highly 
relevant to LeasePlan and are addressed as such. 
Our materiality exercise has made us aware of topics, such as privacy & data security and product differentiation & 
innovation, which are currently addressed elsewhere in the organisation, and need to be incorporated into our CSR agenda.
Looking ahead, the results of LeasePlan’s materiality exercise will be used as part of our adoption of the Global Reporting Initiative 
(GRI) framework. To that end we are currently assessing the availability and quality of data we are able to source in each area.

In 2018 we took the important step of conducting a materiality exercise with our external stakeholders, 
which is a requirement of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework. These are the most widely 
adopted global standards for non-financial reporting, and are used by 93% of the world’s largest 250 
corporations29. At LeasePlan, we intend to start applying GRI standards over the course of 2020. To that 
end, we have begun setting up central reporting on topics such as carbon footprint, fleet electrification, 
diversity and talent development. This has required us to create baseline inventories, define ambition 
levels and develop action plans on both a central and local level.
Our maturing reporting activities have also improved the level and depth of our contributions to the 
Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), in which we have participated since 2010. Our involvement in  
CDP has also enabled us to improve our disclosures to EcoVadis, the sustainability ratings and scorecard 
company that helps procurement teams monitor CSR and ESG practices in the supply chain.
Looking ahead, we want to substantiate our support for the international business declaration in 
support of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which we expressed in  
2017. Set up two years ago by the G20’s Financial Stability Board, the TCFD developed a set of 
recommendations for companies to disclose information on how they oversee and manage climate-
related risks and opportunities, as well as the material risks and opportunities to which they are 
exposed. LeasePlan is currently assessing its overall exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities, 
with a view to quantifying the associated financial impact. 
Developing regulatory requirements
In addition to the expectations of our stakeholders, as a licensed bank and Public Interest Entity (PIE), 
LeasePlan is also subject to various regulatory requirements relating to sustainability. For example,  
the EU Banking Reform Package includes various provisions relating to environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) aspects, while both the Dutch Central Bank (DNB) and Financial Services Authority 
(AFM) have included sustainability in their supervisory priorities for disclosure. Furthermore, the DNB is 
currently engaged in a dialogue with the financial sector to update its supervisory frameworks for the 
incorporation of climate-related risks. Finally, as part of the European Commission’s Action Plan on 
Financing Sustainable Growth, the EC has published draft legislation to take ESG considerations and 
preferences into account.
Disclosure, reporting and regulatory 
requirements
We comply with all regulatory requirements and are 
committed to adopting and maintaining best practices  
in our non-financial disclosure.
