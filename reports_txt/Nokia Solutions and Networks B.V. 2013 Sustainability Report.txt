EnvironmentOverview 
and approach
The last two years have brought significant stresses and 
challenges for our people, not least through the reduction of 
our global workforce by a third as we exited some areas of 
our business, reshaped others and delivered on cost savings 
target of more than EUR 1.5 billion. These changes were 
crucially important to guarantee a sustainable and healthy 
future for NSN, but we also recognize the impact they have 
had on our people. Whether they stayed with NSN or left the 
company, we have sought to support them throughout. 
I am pleased to note that our global employee survey results 
confirm that our people are highly engaged in our strategy 
and increasingly confident in the direction of the company. 
We are about to engage in a period of cultural renewal, 
designed to embed our core values and behaviors 
throughout the business.
One thing that has remained unchanged throughout our 
transformation is our strong commitment to sustainability 
and to the values embodied in the UN Global Compact.
Maintaining high ethical standards and respecting human 
rights is a key priority. In 2013, 96% of our people completed 
annual training on ethical business conduct. As a founding 
member of the Telecommunications Industry Dialogue, we 
contributed to discussions on implementing the industry 
Guiding Principles on Freedom of Expression and Privacy 
and hosted a meeting of the Advisory Panel at our 
headquarters in Finland.
The health and safety of our employees and contractors 
is of vital importance to our business, and our ability to 
uphold high standards in this area is greatly valued by our 
customers. We have achieved global certification to the 
international health and safety management standard 
OHSAS 18001 in all the countries where we operate, with the 
exception of China, where we expect to achieve certification 
in the coming year. This certification gives us a strong 
foundation on which to operate our business in a safe and 
sustainable manner. 
Our management system, however strong, would be nothing 
without the individual commitment of leaders from across 
the business. Along with my executive board, I have been 
personally involved in the programs that have been behind 
the performance improvements we delivered in 2013: 
reducing lost time incident rates by nearly a third and 
significantly lowering the number of fatalities. 
Despite our efforts, I am saddened to report that two 
contractors died falling from height during installation and 
maintenance work in India in 2013. Any fatality is one too 
many. We are determined to continue to drive improvements 
in our processes, competencies and understanding to 
ensure that everyone working for NSN can do so safely. 
Our new consequence management system makes clear 
that we will not tolerate unsafe behavior from contractors.
2013 was another year of great 
change for NSN. We continued with 
the two-year transformation started 
in 2011 and have now completed 
the vast majority of restructuring 
activities related to this effort. In 
addition, our ownership and name 
changed, with Nokia’s purchase 
of Siemens’ 50% share in NSN. 
We are now wholly owned by Nokia.

Our continued drive for energy and resource efficiency 
across our operations has resulted in a further 19% 
reduction in emissions in 2013. We are also developing 
innovative ways to improve the material and energy efficiency 
of our products to help customers cut their carbon footprints 
and reduce their operating costs. 
We are, of course, part of a wider supply chain and I am 
pleased to report that our suppliers are also increasingly 
disclosing and reducing their climate impacts and that 
we continue to conduct in-depth supplier audits to identify 
key risks.
For NSN, economic sustainability is not, alone, a goal in itself, 
but must always be combined with a strong focus on social 
and environmental sustainability. I look forward to reporting 
further progress in 2014.

Managing sustainability
In 2013, focus areas for the Council included recertification of 
our environmental management system to the international 
ISO 14001 standard and global OHSAS 18001 certification 
for health and safety management. Experts from other parts 
of the business are also invited to offer insights on particular 
issues, such as conflict minerals. 
Our sustainability priorities are 
aligned with our new business 
strategy. We focus on ensuring 
NSN is economically sustainable, 
while maintaining key programs 
that help us promote environmental 
and social sustainability.
Governance 
Sustainability at NSN is overseen by the Executive Board, 
which reviews performance at least once a year and 
provides guidance on sustainability related issues. 
The Head of Marketing and Corporate Affairs is the 
board member directly responsible for sustainability. 
Our Corporate Responsibility (CR) team – part of our 
global Health, Safety and Security function – is responsible 
for managing sustainability including human rights, 
environmental management and compliance with 
CR-re
lated regulatory requirements.
An Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) Council, 
established in 2012, runs our global EHS management 
systems, coordinates cross-functional activities, and 
oversees the management of a wide range of sustainability 
issues. The Council meets monthly and includes 
representatives from global business units and Health, 
Safety and Security teams from each of our regions. 
It assembles working groups of experts from various 
business units and functions to discuss relevant 
sustainability issues, share best practice and run specific 
projects as needed.

Stakeholder group How we engage Examples in 2013
Customers We collaborate closely with customers to ensure 
we meet the sustainability standards they require 
of their own suppliers – and help them meet their 
environmental targets.
We aligned our new Health & Safety Consequence 
Management Guidelines for suppliers with our 
customers’ expectations. 
Employees We communicate with employees throughout the 
business to ensure they understand and support our 
strategy, and to gain feedback on how we are doing as 
an employer through our annual Employee Engagement 
Survey. Employees can communicate with one another 
and find information on the activities taking place in 
our business through NSN Connect, our online 
networking platform.
We continued our extensive change management 
program in 2013 to support employees through the 
transformation of the business and engage them in the 
new strategy. Our annual employee survey showed 
significantly improved levels of engagement despite the 
significant changes in the business (see page 36).
Suppliers We work closely with our suppliers to improve their 
management of ethical, labor and environmental issues, 
monitoring their compliance through regular audits.
We ran a series of workshops and webinars to engage 
with suppliers in high-risk countries in 2013 and raise their 
awareness of our Supplier Requirements (see page 26).
Industry We engage with others in our industry to share best 
practices and develop consistent standards and 
guidelines on particular issues.
We continued to participate in the Telecommunications 
Industry Dialogue, which published Guiding Principles 
for the telecommunications industry in 2013 (see page 21).
Governments and 
regulators
We work with governments and regulators to support 
the development of new guidelines and ensure we 
adhere to their standards.
We represented the Telecommunications Industry 
Dialogue and provided advice to the European 
Commission for the development of their guidelines 
on human rights in the Information and Communication 
Technology (ICT) sector (see page 21).
Non-governmental 
organizations 
(NGOs)
We engage with relevant NGOs on particular issues. Through the Industry Dialogue, we engaged with NGOs 
on topics of labor conditions and freedom of association. 
Communities We have policies in place relating to disaster relief and 
to employee volunteering. Employees can choose to 
volunteer their time to support community programs.
We focused our efforts in 2013 on helping to restore 
telecommunications following natural disasters such 
as a super cyclone in Odisha, India.
Stakeholder engagement
In 2013, we engaged with stakeholders on a wide range 
of sustainability issues. Examples are highlighted in the 
table opposite and throughout this report.

We seek to reduce emissions 
across our operations, and save 
resources by minimizing waste. 
We focus on finding ways to 
decrease energy use in our 
buildings and data centers, 
and emissions from logistics.
Improving the efficiency of our operations and engaging 
our employees is helping us save energy, carbon emissions 
and costs, and minimize waste. Our robust, externally 
assured management system underpins all our 
environmental efforts.
Performance in 2013
In 2013, we continued our focus on reducing energy 
consumption and emissions, achieving a 19% reduction of 
total emissions from our operations. We aligned the efforts 
of our Green to Gold strategy to target the areas where we 
have the most significant environmental impacts, including 
manufacturing, test lab facilities and logistics.
Reducing energy use and emissions from our 
buildings and logistics
We are focusing on improving efficiency at our most energy-
intensive buildings, particularly our test labs. Based on our 
analysis of energy use at the 10 sites with the highest energy 
consumption, we have developed improvement plans for 
each site. In 2013, we also began installing sub-meters to 
provide more comprehensive energy metering across all 
test lab sites to better understand, analyze and discover 
opportunities to reduce our energy use. This has helped 
us improve power usage effectiveness – the proportion of 
energy used to power the equipment as opposed to cooling 
and other ancillary functions – at our test labs to achieve our 
target of 1.5.

Operations continued
Our buildings portfolio has changed as a result of significant 
restructuring across the business, which has included 
closing some sites and creating new, more flexible sites 
that can accommodate more staff. With more employees 
working flexibly at home or elsewhere some of the time, we 
are able to reduce the average office space per employee 
by adopting a ‘hot-desk’ approach. We have also aligned 
heating and air conditioning systems with hours of operation 
and external temperatures to avoid heating and cooling 
buildings unnecessarily. In 2014, we aim to consolidate our 
data centers, which will further improve energy efficiency.
Overall, we reduced energy use in our facilities by 9% in 2013 
compared with 2012, exceeding our 5% reduction target 
year on year. As well as improving energy efficiency, we have 
also increased our use of renewable energy to account for 
45% of our total energy use in 2013. This has contributed to 
further reductions in emissions from energy use.
In 2013, we continued our focus on shifting away from air 
transport to lower-carbon alternatives including road and 
sea freight. Our new space-saving ‘Box on Pallet’ packaging 
is also helping to reduce emissions and material use 
associated with transporting our products (see page 16).
We also aim to reduce emissions from employee travel. 
In 2013, we continued to introduce lower-carbon vehicles 
to our fleet of company cars in Europe – including electric 
cars for the first time, in Finland. Emissions from air travel 
remained similar to 2012 levels.

Waste and water
We aim to reduce the amount of waste generated across 
our operations and increase recycling by improving facilities 
for collection and sorting, and encouraging employees to 
recycle more. As we continue to consolidate our buildings 
portfolio, we have also extended our partnership with the 
social enterprise CSR Eco-Solutions to recycle unused 
furniture globally.
In 2013, we generated a total of 6 244 tonnes of waste – 12% 
less than 2012 – and cut waste sent to landfill by 356 tonnes. 
Packaging material, which was recycled, made up more 
than half of our total waste (see page 16).  
We used a total of 532 045m3 of water across our 
operations in 2013. This is an 11% reduction from 2012, 
mainly as a result of office closures. Our operations in 
Chennai, India, recycled 10 800m3 of water.
Environmental management 
Our robust environmental management system provides the 
basis for all our environmental activity. In 2013, we completed 
an extensive global audit program to achieve re-certification 
to the international environmental management standard 
ISO 14001. Our top five most significant environmental 
aspects across the business – based on the extent of their 
impact on the environment and our ability to manage them 
– are unchanged from 2012. These are:
 § E
nergy consumption
 § S
uppliers and third-party products (see Suppliers, page 26)
 § T
ravel and transport
 § W
aste management
 § C
ompliance with environmental laws.
Of these, energy consumption is the single biggest 
contributor, and therefore the main focus of our targets.
Our employees play an important role in helping us meet our 
environmental targets. We use a range of channels to raise 
awareness and stimulate action. In 2013, we introduced a 
new intranet site and social networking sites to encourage 
our employees to discuss environmental topics and share 
best practice.

Environment
We are developing innovative ways 
to improve the material and energy 
efficiency of our products to bring 
benefits for the environment and 
help our customers save money.
Use of energy and materials is a key theme in our 
research and development of new products and services. 
By developing products that use energy more efficiently 
we can help our customers reduce their energy use, 
emissions and costs. We also aim to improve efficiency 
of transporting products and reduce waste through the 
design of our packaging.
Performance in 2013
We continued to improve the energy efficiency of our 
products in use by refining hardware models, developing 
software and supporting customers with energy 
management services. Our Technology and Innovation 
Research team also focused on using materials more 
efficiently in the design and manufacture of our products 
and we sought to ensure components can be recycled 
at end of life. 
Products using less energy and materials
We aim to ensure that every new product is more energy 
efficient than the previous model. For example, the energy 
efficiency of our 2012 Flexi Multiradio Base Transceiver 
Station improved by 19% from the 2010 model, and we 
are now working towards further improvements in the 
next model.

We estimate the energy used when our products are in use 
based on their average maximum power consumption and 
the number of years they are typically in operation in mobile 
networks. The total usetime energy consumption of our 
products has increased since 2011. However, significant 
changes to the type of equipment mean that each product 
enables higher volumes of network traffic when in use – 
resulting in improved energy efficiency overall. In 2014, 
we will begin work to develop a more meaningful measure 
of product energy efficiency, following the European 
Telecommunications Standards Institute’s standard.

summary
Overview 
and approach
Environment
In 2013, we formally embedded energy efficiency into 
our product creation process and trained research and 
development teams accordingly to ensure environmental 
considerations are an integral part of product development. 
We continue to develop new software and active features, 
which can change the way existing equipment runs to use 
energy more efficiently. This also enables radio access 
networks to better adapt to variable network demand in 
different locations and at different times – a trend that has 
been accentuated by the increased use of smart phones 
and demand for data.
In addition, our energy management services help network 
operators meet their energy and emissions targets and save 
energy costs. These services include optimizing equipment 
and site design, remote monitoring and field maintenance, 
as well as other aspects of the customers’ energy use, such 
as procurement and use of renewable energy. We have 
applied energy efficiency measures to more than 5 900 sites 
since 2009.
Reducing the use of materials in our radio access network 
equipment also reduces their environmental footprint by 
using resources more efficiently. In 2013, our Technology 
and Innovation Research team focused on several material 
efficiency projects. We continued to analyse material use 
and disposal through life cycle assessments. For example, 
over 90% of the materials in our Flexi Multiradio Base 
Transceiver Stations made in 2013 can be disassembled 
and recycled at the end of the product’s life. 
Products and services continued
Participation in research
We are partnering with others in our industry to develop a 
common framework for measuring environmental impacts, 
and to create standards that help to identify where we can 
make improvements. Since 2012, we have been participating 
in OPERA-Net 2 – a project of the Celtic-Plus European ICT 
Cluster Research Initiative, part of the Eureka Network – that 
aims to examine the environmental impacts across network 
infrastructure, and works with standards bodies to develop 
an agreed approach to environmental measurement. 
The results of this project are anticipated in 2015.
We participate in European Commission pilot projects 
to test our standards and develop new approaches 
to measuring impacts. We have proposed a simplified 
approach that concentrates on energy and resource use 
across the life cycle of our products. Our previous studies 
have shown that energy consumption during manufacturing 
and use accounts for 75-95% of the total environmental 
impact, with use being the biggest contributor.
Managing other environmental impacts 
In addition to energy and materials, our product and service 
development processes also consider environmental factors 
such as hazardous substances, packaging and recyclability. 
We comply with the EU Restriction of Hazardous Substances 
(RoHS) Directive and Registration, Evaluation, Authorization 
and restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulations.
The NSN Substance List identifies substances that have 
been banned, restricted and targeted for reduction, and 
is updated regularly. In addition to our internal focus, we 
encourage our suppliers to phase out substances which 
are classified as ‘Monitored’.

Packaging is a key area where we can save money and 
reduce environmental impacts. In 2013, we introduced 
a new method of packaging, using pallets to transport the 
boxes without being in additional containers. The new ‘box 
on pallet’ packaging saves space, reduces use of materials, 
and limits costs. With 8kg less packaging material per pallet 
load, it helps to reduce fuel consumption in transportation, 
cutting carbon emissions by around 43%. We reuse the 
packaging for products that we receive at our inbound 
distribution hub, for outbound products.

 Ethics and 
human rights
Overview 
and approach
Maintaining the trust of our 
customers and the integrity of our 
business depends on our strong 
commitment to promote ethical 
behavior and uphold human rights. 
Our Code of Conduct details our high ethical standards, 
and includes our promise to ensure our communications 
technologies are not used to infringe human rights. The 
values and commitments set out in the Code must be 
upheld across our business by our employees, suppliers, 
and partners. 
We help employees better understand what the Code 
means to them by providing training in ethical business 
practices, and we work with suppliers and business partners 
to ensure they are aware of our expectations. We encourage 
people to report any concerns about potential ethical 
breaches and have a due diligence process to flag human 
rights risks in our sales process. We investigate all 
notifications and take appropriate action. 
Performance in 2013
Promoting employee awareness of our ethical standards 
and encouraging openness about concerns remained 
central to our efforts in 2013. We also worked to overcome 
technical issues related to our human rights due diligence 
tool and continued to engage with others in our industry 
on privacy and freedom of expression. 
Training and awareness
Annual training on ethical business conduct and human 
rights is mandatory for all employees to help them 
understand how to apply our Code of Conduct in everyday 
decision-making. 
Our Ethical Business Training demonstrates how the Code 
can be applied to real-life scenarios, addressing issues such 
as ethics in the workplace, proper accounting and controls, 
conflicts of interest, and facilitation payments. Around 96% 
of employees completed this training in 2013.
In 2013, we began to consolidate the policies that define 
our ethical standards to make them simpler and easier 
to understand, starting with a streamlined NSN Gift, 
Entertainment and Hospitality Policy.

Anti-corruption: prevention and detection 
Our anti-corruption strategy focuses on two key areas: 
prevention and detection. To reach as many employees 
as possible, we offer anti-corruption training online,

video channel). In 2013, 96% of employees completed 
anti-corruption training as part of our wider Ethical 
Business Training and a further 2 1

efforts to tackle corruption. 
Reporting ethical concerns
We encourage employees and anyone working with NSN 
to report any concerns about potential breaches of our 
Code of Conduct. Employees can ask for guidance or report 
ethical concerns by emailing ethics@nsn.com, or remain 
anonymous by contacting the ethics hotline on our website. 
We take all reports of ethical misconduct seriously. In 2013, 
our Ethics and Compliance Office investigated 192 alleged 
abuses of the NSN Code of Conduct. As a result, employees 
were dismissed or issued written or verbal warnings.

Examples of ethical issues encountered by employees
Issue raised Our guidance Action taken
A whistleblower reported a concern that 
a line manager misused their position to 
recruit friends and relatives for vacant 
positions with high salaries.
NSN has a conflict of interest policy which 
prohibits favoritism.
The investigation into the report found no 
evidence of favoritism, as none of the line 
manager's relatives work for NSN. 
An employee reported a concern 
that they were given a Performance 
Improvement Plan (PIP), a program 
low-performing employees are enrolled 
in, based on discriminatory reasons. 
NSN is committed to the highest standards 
of ethical conduct and does not tolerate 
discrimination.
An investigation by the Ethics and 
Compliance office found that the employee’s 
annual assessment showed their 
performance needed improvement. Their 
PIP was given to support their performance, 
and not as a result of alleged discrimination.
A whistleblower reported that an external 
employee working as an NSN engineer 
was also running his own company.
NSN has a zero tolerance policy for 
corruption and fraud.
The investigation revealed that the external 
employee is the MD and CEO of a company 
that works with an NSN competitor. The 
employee was removed from NSN 
employment.
Human rights due diligence
We strongly believe that communication networks have an 
important role in promoting human rights by enabling free 
expression, access to information, exchange of ideas and 
economic development. 
In line with our human rights policy, we carry out extensive 
risk assessments and due diligence. Our approach starts 
with our sales agents. In 2013, we started training sessions 
on our human rights policies and due diligence for our 
employees in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and Europe. In 
2014, we will continue providing further training for regional 
customer teams with information specific to their region.
Sales agents feed information about potential deals into our 
global sales platform, which features an automated system 
that assesses the potential for misuse of our technology 
based on the type of technology for sale and the human 
rights record of the purchasing country. 
The automated system is designed to issue a warning flag 
for sales found to be potentially high-risk. This prompts a 
review process which involves a detailed analysis and risk 
assessment of the sale in question. The results of the review 
are evaluated by a committee, the Head of Sales in the 
region of interest, and the NSN Executive Board if there 
is any remaining doubt about potential risk. If we judge that 
the risk of product misuse is too high, we will decline the 
opportunity of a sale.

Overview 
and approach
We identified a glitch in the automated system in late 2013, 
which meant some cases were not flagged. We uncovered 
the missed cases (a very small number) to double-check 
their potential risk. The glitch has since been fixed and 
preventative measures taken to prevent a re-occurrence. 
We are continuing to follow up on these cases to ensure all 
related possible risks are properly mitigated. We are also 
taking steps to further improve our due diligence process by 
embedding these checks deeper in the relevant processes, 
in addition to the automated features in the relevant tools.
We will report the outcome of the mitigation work, as well 
as the updated process in our 2014 Sustainability Report.
Further information on our due diligence fact sheet is 
available on our website.
Developing industry principles 
NSN is a founding member of the Telecommunications 
Industry Dialogue, a group of telecommunications operators 
and vendors who jointly address freedom of expression and 
privacy rights in the telecommunications sector. 
In March 2013, the group published and signed the Industry 
Dialogue Guiding Principles. Influenced by the UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights, the principles 
address issues of privacy and freedom of expression as they 
relate to the telecommunications sector. They specifically 
focus on the interaction and boundaries between a 
government’s duty to protect human rights and the 
corporate responsibility of telecommunications companies 
to respect human rights. These principles are the result of 
two years of dialogue that included stakeholder outreach.
Ethics and human rights continued
The Telecommunications Industry Dialogue formally has 
established its own governance and signed a contract 
initiating a two-year collaboration with the multi-stakeholder 
Global Network Initiative (GNI). Both groups aim to advance 
freedom of expression and privacy rights in the Information 
and Communication Technology (ICT) sector. 
In November 2013, the Industry Dialogue and GNI held their 
first joint Learning Forum in Brussels, enabling civil society 
organizations, academics, investors, government officials, 
international organizations and ICT companies to share their 
perspectives on current challenges relating to freedom 
of expression and privacy. Participants discussed issues 
emerging as a result of revelations about large-scale 
government-led communications surveillance.
In December 2013, we hosted the Advisory Panel of the 
Industry Dialogue at NSN headquarters in Espoo, Finland, 
where representatives shared best practices and discussed 
how to implement the newly published Guiding Principles.

Overview 
and approach
To help our customers safeguard 
their users’ personal data 
effectively, we build security 
and privacy into the design 
of our products. 
NSN provides network equipment to telecommunications 
providers (our customers), but we do not control the 
personal data transmitted over the network. However, we 
understand consumers are increasingly concerned about 
the potential for security breaches or infringements of their 
privacy, as more and more data is transmitted and stored 
over telecommunications networks. We help our customers 
ensure their networks are secure, so that they in turn can 
maintain the confidence of consumers.
We also recognize that requests from governments and 
law enforcement agencies to access data transmitted 
over telecommunications networks can raise human rights 
concerns. We have worked with others in our industry to 
develop Guiding Principles on Freedom of Expression and 
Privacy, which set out a common approach to dealing with 
demands from governments (see page 21). 
Managing security and privacy 
We aim to observe the highest standards of integrity and 
ethical conduct in all our operations, and embed these as 
part of our organizational culture. Our commitments are 
set out in our Code of Conduct (see nsn.com/about-us/
sustainability/our-approach/code-of-conduct), which 
includes respecting the privacy of our customers and other 
parties. We have established robust security and privacy 
measures, and we run awareness campaigns to mitigate 
the risk of any breach resulting from human error.
Three key objectives underpin our approach to managing 
security and privacy:
 § T
o provide products that are designed to help 
telecommunications operators comply with their 
privacy obligations.
 § T
o offer reliable and trustworthy service to our 
customers.
 § T
o ensure that NSN products respect the privacy 
of end-users.

Overview 
and approach
Our security policies are designed to ensure compliance 
with external regulations and customer requirements. They 
are based on best practices and aligned with ISO 27001, the 
internationally recognized standard on information security 
management. In India, six of our sites are certified to ISO 
27001, and in 2013, we extended certification to our global 
delivery center in Portugal. In 2014, we will re-certify our sites 
in India and focus on complying with new requirements 
outlined in the latest version of ISO 27001, including 
improving controls to further secure the services we deliver 
to our customers. 
We conduct external assessments for NSN’s business-
critical applications based on the perceived risk and 
anticipated exposure to security threats. In 2013, 
assessments were conducted on end user services, human 
resources and financial services. The findings concluded 
that security threats did not pose a major risk to our 
business, and that we are managing them adequately. 
Security and privacy continued
Security and privacy by design
We aim to build security and privacy into the design and 
development of new products. Each area of our business 
has a Product Security Manager who oversees the 
implementation of our product security processes and 
guidelines, and we nominate a Security Lead for each 
individual product line. 
However, not all risks can be resolved at the design stage. 
Our design for security and security vulnerability monitoring 
processes enable us to detect and manage potential 
vulnerabilities. Where appropriate for the type of product or 
function, this may include a detailed assessment, supported 
by external security experts or hackers, simulating attacks 
that a product might face in a real network.
Our product privacy guidelines provide a checklist of privacy 
considerations in product design including the level of user 
control and the ability to express preferences about how 
data is used.

We expect our suppliers to 
meet the high ethical, labor and 
environmental standards set out in 
our Supplier Requirements before 
we will work with them. We conduct 
regular and robust assessments to 
ensure compliance, and work with 
suppliers to improve performance 
where needed. 
Key suppliers account for the majority of our purchasing 
spend and are the highest risk to our business as they 
provide the products and services that we sell to our 
customers. We work closely with them to ensure they meet 
our Supplier Requirements, with a specific focus on high 
standards of health and safety particularly for services 
suppliers. To help improve sustainability performance 
throughout our supply chain, we encourage our suppliers 
to apply the same standards to their own suppliers, and 
we collaborate with other organizations in our industry.
Performance in 2013
In 2013, we conducted more in-depth audits on specific 
issues to check that suppliers are adequately addressing 
key risks. Measures to improve suppliers’ health and safety 
performance continued to be a major focus and we saw 
significant progress in the number of suppliers disclosing 
and targeting reductions in their climate impacts. We also 
engaged with suppliers through industry initiatives to 
conduct due diligence related to conflict minerals. 
Driving improvements through supplier audits
We conduct in-depth audits on labor conditions and 
environmental management for high-risk suppliers to 
ensure they comply with the NSN Supplier Requirements. 
These assessments include document reviews, interviews 
with managers and employees, site visits and warehouse 
inspections. In 2013, we spent 32 days conducting in-depth 
audits at 10 supplier sites in China and India. We found 92 
instances of non-compliance, 42 of which related to health 
and safety (see table on page 27). Based on the findings of 
our audits, we made 153 recommendations for improvement 
which are being addressed through corrective action plans 
(see table on page 27 for examples). 
Health and safety is a particular risk for suppliers supporting 
our Services business, and remains a strong focus for NSN. 
In 2013, we included more stringent questions on health and 
safety in our tendering process for service contracts. We 
also launched a consequence management system to make 
it clear that failing to demonstrate robust safety management 
is unacceptable.

In addition to these in-depth audits of high-risk suppliers 
on specific issues, sustainability criteria are included in our 
regular performance evaluations of suppliers. Suppliers that 
are new to NSN are also subject to system audits to check 
compliance with our Supplier Requirements. As we continued 
to consolidate the number of suppliers we use globally, there 
were only 27 system audits of new suppliers in 2013. 
In instances of non-compliance, we invest in programs to 
help our suppliers improve. But if suppliers fail to show a 
satisfactory change of behavior, we escalate the issue to 
senior management and will stop working with the supplier 
until the issue is resolved. 
We aim to continually improve the way we assess and 
manage suppliers’ sustainability performance. In 2013, we 
began piloting the E-TASC supply chain management tool 
powered by EcoVadis and invited our top 100 suppliers to 
participate. Of these, 52 suppliers (accounting for 25% of 
our total spend) completed the assessment in 2013. In 2014, 
we plan to follow up with corrective plans for any suppliers 
considered to be a medium or high risk, based on their 
responses to the EcoVadis self-assessment.

Training
We run web-based training workshops for suppliers operating 
in high-risk countries to raise their awareness of different 
elements of our Supplier Requirements – including labor 
conditions and due diligence on conflict minerals – and to 
improve their capacity to meet these standards. By 
conducting training online, we can reach more suppliers, while 
reducing costs and carbon emissions associated with travel. 
In 2013, we organized two webinars involving 93 new 
suppliers and, as part of our increasing focus on health and 
safety, we ran two training workshops for 29 suppliers in 
India and China, focused on addressing health and safety, 
as well as labor and environmental risks. 
Our procurement teams are also trained on sustainability 
issues to help them communicate our requirements to 
suppliers and identify potential sustainability risks. Around 
96% of procurement staff completed training on ethical 
conduct and anti-corruption in 2013 as part of our Ethical 
Business Training for all employees (see page 18). We also 
developed additional web-based sustainability training 
related to procurement, health and safety and environmental 
requirements, which will be introduced in 2014.

Reducing the environmental impact of our suppliers
We aim to reduce environmental impacts associated with 
our supply chain by encouraging key suppliers to report 
their climate impact and set carbon reduction targets 
through the CDP Supply Chain Program. Of our top 200 
suppliers, 121 (representing 39% of our total procurement 
spend) have responded to CDP’s request for information –  
up from 66 in 2012.
According to the CDP responses, around 50% of our top 
200 suppliers are now disclosing their carbon emissions 
and 30% have set reduction targets. Their carbon reduction 
initiatives have saved a total of 46 million tonnes of CO2 
equivalent and around USD 1.8 billion in 2013 alone. Watch 
the video for more on how we have been working with our 
suppliers to improve their energy efficiency. 
We have seen considerable improvements in our suppliers’ 
willingness to disclose and address their climate change 
impacts, and aim to encourage our top 100 suppliers to 
set emissions reduction targets by 2016. 
All our suppliers (except those with very low environmental 
impacts) must have a documented environmental 
management system (EMS) and, for key suppliers and those 
with higher impacts, this must be certified to ISO 14001. 
Tackling conflict minerals
Electronic components contain many different metals 
often including tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold (‘3TG’). 
These metals are derived from minerals which are widely 
mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where 
there are concerns that the proceeds from mining in certain 
regions are used by armed groups to fuel conflict and human 
rights abuses. 
We do not tolerate the use of such ‘conflict minerals’ in 
our products. This is clearly outlined in our policy on conflict 
minerals and integrated in our Supplier Requirements, which 
are communicated to suppliers. 
NSN is supporting industry efforts to tackle conflict 
minerals that seek to improve transparency in the supply 
chain to enable companies to trace back metals in their 
products to responsible, ‘conflict-free’ sources. We seek 
to develop sustainable solutions that enable support of 
legitimate trade and positive development in the DRC and 
adjoining countries. 
Through the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) 
and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI), we support 
the industry’s Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI). The 
CFSI aims to trace metals back to smelters through supplier 
due diligence and certify ‘conflict-free’ smelters by tracing 
minerals to individual mines. These efforts aim to improve the 
traceability of minerals in the ICT supply chain, and help 
companies meet new U.S. legislation requiring them to 
report whether their products may contain minerals from the 
DRC and adjoining countries.
We have developed a robust due diligence approach that 
is aligned with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for 
Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals. We are conducting 
due diligence on all relevant suppliers and encouraging them 
to ensure their own suppliers are compliant, all the way down 
to the smelters or refiners where the minerals are processed 
into metals.

Suppliers continued
In 2013, we continued to evaluate our suppliers’ due 
diligence activities and collect information on the smelters 
that the 3TG in our products is sourced from by asking 
all 282 relevant suppliers to complete the CFSI reporting 
template. We received 262 responses. All responses were 
analyzed and we followed up with corrective action plans 
where needed. We are introducing requirements that will 
direct our suppliers to source 3TG only from smelters that 
are validated as conflict-free. All this will help us work 
towards our goal of conflict-free products by 2016. 
Further information on our due diligence activities and the 
results of our due diligence process in 2013 will be published 
in a Conflict Minerals Report, available at nsn.com/about-us/

Health and safety
We put safety first. The health, 
safety and wellbeing of NSN 
employees and our contractors 
is central to how we do business 
at NSN. 
We strive to ensure that all employees and contractors are 
aware of the risks associated with their job, and receive the 
necessary training and equipment to work safely – whether 
in the office or on site. Our focus on safety is not only 
important to us as a responsible business, but is also 
demanded by our customers. Differentiating ourselves 
by demonstrating robust safety standards and improved 
performance helps us build trust and win work. 
Performance in 2013
We continued to improve our health and safety 
performance in 2013 by raising employee awareness 
and engaging leaders to promote a ‘safety-first’ culture 
worldwide. The rate of lost-time incidents per 1,000 
employees decreased by 32% compared with 2012.
Our efforts to improve health and safety have helped 
to significantly reduce the number of fatalities in 2013. 
But any fatality is unacceptable to NSN. We deeply regret 
that two contractors died as a result of falls from height 
during installation and preventive maintenance work for 
NSN in India. Both incidents were fully investigated and 
corrective and preventive actions have been taken to 
prevent similar incidents.

Improving safety management 
In 2013, we achieved OHSAS 18001 certification for all our 
global operations except China, due to changes to China’s 
certification requirements. We aim to certify our operations in 
China by the end of 2014. OHSAS 18001 is an internationally 
recognized standard that provides the framework and 
foundation for our health and safety management system, 
and drives continuous improvement. Achieving this 
certification, following a series of independent external 
audits, demonstrates our focus on preventive measures, 
contractor controls, employee awareness and meeting 
customer and legal requirements.

Health and safety continued
Our mandatory health and safety training underscores the 
importance of identifying and avoiding risks and reporting 
incidents. Engaging our leaders and encouraging reporting 
of near-misses – hazards or incidents that did not result 
in injury but could have – helps to reinforce the importance 
of proactive safety management. By creating a culture that 
identifies hazards and supports active risk prevention and 
action, we can significantly lower the number of incidents 
that occur. As part of this shift, senior leaders are getting 
more actively involved in safety with regular management 
reviews and site tours. 
We have increased our focus on reporting of near miss 
incidents in 2013, tracking 636 near misses – more than 
three times the amount recorded in 2012. We investigate 
high potential incidents and near misses to identify and 
analyze their root causes, so we can put in place effective 
measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again. 
All fatal and high potential incidents are reviewed with 
members of the Executive Board and we hold quarterly 
fatality prevention meetings. 
Our internal Safety Award recognizes outstanding efforts 
to improve safety across the business. A team working 
with one of our key customers in Italy won the award in 
2013 for the development of mandatory safety training for 
subcontractors, which supplemented existing training with 
information specific to NSN site activities and contributed 
to zero accidents in that part of the business in 2013. 
Addressing key risks
In addition to conducting risk assessments, we track and 
analyze high potential incidents to identify our most pressing 
risks and develop effective corrective plans. Key safety risks 
for our employees and contractors include driving and 
working at a height, which together accounted for 76% 
of high-potential incidents in 2013. 
More than half of high potential incidents recorded in 2013 
were road traffic accidents. We provide targeted road safety 
awareness programs and safe driving initiatives in high-risk 
regions. In Latin America, for example, initiatives such as 
GPS tracking to monitor employees’ driving speeds and 
‘How’s my driving?’ stickers to encourage the public to 
report unsafe behavior have helped to reduce speeding 
fines and traffic accidents. 
Many high-risk activities, including working at height, are 
carried out by subcontractors for our customer operations, 
so it is important they are aware of the proper safety 
procedures and use the right equipment. In addition, 
we are working hard to enhance our safety standards 
by conducting field and site inspections and rigorous risk 
assessments, as well as requiring appropriate personal 
protective equipment to be worn at all times when working 
at height. To support this effort, in 2013 we ran two training 
workshops for suppliers in India and China that aimed to 
support them in identifying and addressing safety issues. 
We have also introduced a consequence management 
system for contractors that fail to demonstrate robust 
safety management (see Suppliers, page 26).

NSN is emerging from a major 
restructuring process. We aimed to 
support our employees throughout 
and keep them informed of 
changes through regular dialogue. 
We are now entering the next phase 
of change, focused on NSN’s 
cultural transformation. 
Performance in 2013
We achieved our cost savings target of more than 1.5 billion 
by the end of 2013. We also continued to focus on delivering 
an efficient and effective change management program, and 
we are now entering a new phase of change that will focus 
on embedding a strong values-based corporate culture. 
Results of our global employee survey show that employees 
recognize our efforts and are increasingly engaged with our 
new business strategy, and scores increased in all areas. We 
continue to invest in training and maintain our commitment 
to provide safe, fair and equal working conditions by 
following global standards for labor conditions. 
Restructuring
The two-year restructuring program announced in 2011 was 
essential to improve the efficiency of our business. It has also 
led to significant changes in our workforce. By the end of 
2013, we had 48 628 employees – one third fewer than 2011 
(see table opposite). 
Throughout the restructuring process, we aimed to provide 
support and clearly communicate changes to affected 
employees – and wherever possible, transfer them into new 
roles within NSN. In instances where redundancies were 
unavoidable, we followed local legal requirements when and 
where required, and worked with local communities to help 
people find employment.

Change management 
In 2013, we continued our Focused Mind program to help 
our people feel equipped to cope with change and motivated 
to deliver our new business strategy. We also began the 
global rollout of our Discipline, Accountability and Profit and 
Growth (DAP) mindset program, following a pilot in 2012. 
By outlining a common approach for all business units to 
follow, DAP is helping to drive a consistent way of working 
and encouraging a collective transformation of our business. 
Each business unit has an action plan to address DAP 
related challenges, and performance against DAP is now 
part of employee performance evaluations. The results of our 
Employee Support for Direction and Change survey showed 
that DAP is working, with 68% of employees responding 
positively in 2013, exceeding our target. 
In 2014, we will begin implementing a program to embed 
our values and build a strong corporate culture to support 
NSN’s business strategy. We used feedback from 
employees and leaders to develop a framework to support 
this cultural transformation.
Engagement
In 2013, we increased the number of questions in our 
annual employee engagement survey to give us a better 
understanding of employees’ perspectives on our business 
and how we are managing them. Results from our survey 
showed record high employee engagement levels in 2013, 
with our highest ever response rate of 93% (up from 87% 
in 2012) and an overall Employee Engagement Index of 82%, 
a nine point increase from 2012. 
Our efforts to manage change, create a clear direction for 
the company and address other key areas for improvement 
identified in our previous surveys are paying off. In 2013, 
we saw significant increases in all areas of the engagement 
survey (see table on page 37). Employees’ optimism about 
the future of NSN increased by 15 points, pride in working 
at NSN increased by 14 points and overall perception of 
leadership increased by 12 points. 
Despite the significant change we have undergone, 
NSN’s engagement results are now comparable with 
other telecommunications companies overall (based on 
comparative normative data), and stronger than comparative 
scores in the areas of change (+3.4%) and innovation (+5.1%). 
However, performance and personal development 
remain lower than the external benchmark of the 
telecommunications industry and we aim to address this 
in 2014 by encouraging employees to complete Personal 
Development Plans (see page 37). 
Employee Engagement Index
The Employee Engagement Index measures our 
people’s emotional, rational and motivational 
commitment to the company based on a set of nine 
survey questions. The Leadership Perception Index 
measures employees’ confidence in our leaders’ 
capabilities based on a set of seven survey questions.

Training and development
We continued to invest in training and support for our 
people to develop the capabilities needed to deliver our 
new business strategy. In 2013, we spent approximately 
EUR 41.5 million (compared with EUR 50 million in 2012) on 
124 600 days of training for employees through our Academy. 
This reduced expenditure is the result of a significant 
reduction in the number of employees at NSN, as well as 
our increasing use of more cost-effective virtual technologies 
to deliver training, such as virtual classroom learning.

Leadership development is a priority for NSN and we remain 
committed to enabling employees at all levels to develop 
their leadership skills. In 2013, programs included Leading 
for Performance, designed to develop the leadership skills 
of high potential managers, Leading with Influence for high 
potential employees, and Communication for Presence 
for senior managers and executives. We also offer training 
programs such as Leading Teams and Coaching for 
Performance. Globally, over 1
 4
00 employees were involved 
in our leadership programs (more than double the number 
in 2012), and the overall satisfaction rate was 5.43 out of 6.
We recognize personal development is a key factor in 
retaining and engaging our employees, and improving 
opportunities in this area has been a focus in 2013. We 
encourage employees to complete a Personal Development 
Plan (PDP), agreed with their line manager, outlining how 
they will work towards their personal and career aspirations 
in the short and long term. In 2013, the number of employees 
with a PDP increased significantly to 68% from 36% in 2012. 
Additionally, over 84% of employees completed a 
performance evaluation.

Independent assurance statement
Scope and objectives
DNV GL has undertaken independent assurance of the 
Nokia Solutions and Networks’ (NSN) Sustainability Report 
2013 (‘the Report’).
The assurance process was conducted in accordance with 
AA1000AS (2008). We were engaged to provide Type 2 
moderate level assurance, which covers: 
 § e
valuation of adherence to the AA1000APS (2008) 
principles of inclusivity, materiality and responsiveness 
(‘the Principles’); and 
 § t
he reliability of specified sustainability performance 
information, as listed in the NSN Key Performance 
Indicators (KPIs) section on page 40.
Responsibilities of the directors of NSN  
and of the assurance providers
The directors of NSN have sole responsibility for the 
preparation of the Report. 
We were not involved in the preparation of any part of the 
Report and we have no other contract with NSN. This is 
the third year that we have provided assurance.
In addition to the assurance of the Report, we reviewed 
evidence for a sample of material claims in NSN’s 20-F 
submission to Nokia Group.
Our statement represents our independent opinion and 
is intended to inform all of NSN’s stakeholders. We adopt 
a balanced approach towards all stakeholders.
Basis of our opinion
Our work was designed to gather evidence to provide 
moderate level assurance as defined in AA1000AS (2008). 
We undertook the following activities:
 § R
eview of the current sustainability issues that could 
affect NSN and are of interest to stakeholders;
 § I
nterviews with selected directors and senior managers 
responsible for management of sustainability issues and 
review of selected evidence to support issues discussed;
 § R
eview of NSN’s approach to stakeholder engagement 
and recent outputs;
 § R
eview of information provided to us by NSN on its 
reporting and management processes relating to 
the Principles;
 § R
eview of supporting evidence for key claims and 
performance indicators prioritised according to 
materiality at a consolidated corporate level; and
 § R
eview of the processes for gathering and consolidating 
performance data and for a sample, checking 
consolidation from reporting system to the Report. 
We used the AA1000 Accountability Principles Standard as 
criteria to evaluate the nature of adherence to the principles 
of Inclusivity, Materiality and Responsiveness and the Global 
Reporting Initiative Quality of Information Principles as 
criteria for evaluating the selected performance information. 
Findings and opinion
We reviewed and provided feedback on drafts of the Report 
and, where necessary, changes were made in relation to the 
information and data assured. 
On the basis of the work undertaken, nothing came to our 
attention to suggest that the Report does not properly reflect 
its material issues or describe NSN’s adherence to the 
Principles or its performance, with the following exceptions:
 § N
SN discovered in August 2013 that the system for 
flagging potential human rights issues during due 
diligence processes had failed to operate automatically 
as expected. It is understood that this means there is 
a risk that sales could have potentially gone ahead that 
may have been declined if human rights issues had 
been properly identified during the due diligence 
process. We understand that remediation actions are 
being put in place, and that NSN will report on this issue 
in the next sustainability report.
Observations 
Without affecting our assurance opinion we also provide 
the following observations.
 § L
ast year we stated that NSN should demonstrate 
how the business priorities have been adapted for 
the newly restructured business and how the new 
business strategy will be implemented. The ongoing 
transformation programme and wider business review 
process is impacting on NSN’s ability to finalise its longer 
term sustainability strategy including setting meaningful 
measurable targets. We understand that the next report 
will outline the new strategy and targets.

summary
Independent assurance statement continued
Inclusivity concerns the participation of stakeholders 
in developing and achieving an accountable and 
strategic response to sustainability
 § N
SN continues to demonstrate an inclusive approach to 
employee engagement and has undertaken a specific 
employee survey. Despite the recent restructuring and 
changes to the business, we note that the employee 
survey results are still largely positive and indicate positive 
support from employees for the future direction of the 
company. This reflects the efforts in communications and 
management of the impact of the restructuring programme.
 § I
n our statement last year we noted that NSN collaborates 
closely with its stakeholders. We recommended reviewing 
the opportunities from a formalised structure, for example 
a stakeholder panel, to integrate stakeholders’ views 
into strategic decision making, enhancing sustainability 
management. We restate this recommendation. 
Material issues are those which are necessary for 
stakeholders to make informed judgments concerning 
NSN and its impacts
 § L
ast year NSN undertook a review of its material issues 
to align its sustainability efforts with the new business 
strategy. We understand that future materiality reviews 
will be validated with external stakeholders including 
investors and customers who are engaged as part of the 
development of NSN’s sustainability platform. This will 
allow a broader scope of stakeholders to understand in 
greater detail how their concerns have been addressed 
in line with NSN’s overall sustainability strategy. We 
recommend that this activity continues to be prioritised. 
 § N SN has identified that emissions from products 
constitute significant impacts on the environment. 
We would recommend that the measurements are 
based on a publicly available methodology on how 
NSN compares and calculates energy efficiencies, 
to enable improved comparability and transparency 
across operations. 
Responsiveness concerns the extent to which 
an organisation responds to stakeholder issues
 § L
ast year we recommended disclosure on the rationale 
for changes to targets, particularly relating to Health and 
Safety, Employees, and Supplier performance, as they 
remain material. We restate this recommendation. 
 § N
SN has implemented energy efficiency measures, 
such as sub-meters, for different sites in its real estate 
portfolio. We recommend extending this to all material 
sites (e.g. based on energy consumption) to allow for 
granular data to be collected at site level. This will 
enable NSN to identify site level efficiencies and 
target investments.
Performance information
 § W
e observed generally robust data collection, collation 
and reporting systems and processes. On the basis 
of the work undertaken, nothing came to our attention 
to suggest that the data published is inaccurate or 
materially misstated.
 § W
e observed greater accuracy of emissions data for 
facilities as the use of estimates has been reduced 
and the calculations are now largely based on actual 
billed data.
 § R eported emissions data currently do not include any 
data on emissions from the company fleet. NSN are 
aware that this data is material and NSN will report on 
fleet emissions in the future.
 § A
s per last year, the fatality numbers reported match 
the evidence provided; however, NSN is aware of an 
improvement opportunity for the data collection system 
to enable capturing each individual fatality, rather than 
incidents, which has the potential to over or under 
report fatalities. 
 § F
or many KPIs data collection remains largely manual, 
thus increasing the risk for potential human error in data 
transmission. We recommend consideration of automated 
data collection processes/systems where practicable.
 § F
or example, as supply chain activities expand more 
data is being collected and reported. This data is held 
in different systems and aggregation is largely manual. 
Processes would benefit from further integration of 
systems and automation.
