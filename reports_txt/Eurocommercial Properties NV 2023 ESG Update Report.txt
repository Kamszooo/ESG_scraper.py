Our ESG strategy
At Eurocommercial Properties, we recognise that 
building a sustainable and resilient business is the 
foundation for long-term success. The ESG and 
business strategies are carefully aligned, and each 
business decision is approached with a long-term 
view, supported by detailed research to evaluate its 
environmental and socio-economic impact. While 
each shopping centre presents its individual set 
of challenges and opportunities, Eurocommercial 
has developed a broad ESG vision and strategy to 
meet global challenges and the future demands 
of customers, tenants, and employees while 
creating sustainable centres. The ESG approach 
is centred around three strategic pillars: Be green, 
Be engaged, Be responsible. These pillars guide 
our efforts to reduce environmental impact, engage 
with stakeholders, and act responsibly towards 
society and the environment.
Materiality assessment
ESG applies to all aspects of Eurocommercial’s 
business operations. In 2020, the Company 
mapped out particular topics and targets to help 
develop the business with impact while enhancing 
value. These clear objectives underpin the current 
strategy. The ﬁrst step was to execute a detailed 
materiality assessment to thoroughly assess a wide 
range of ESG topics. The Company then selected 
which topics would create the most value for 
Eurocommercial and its stakeholders, while aligning 
with the United Nations Sustainable Development 
Goals on the global agenda. Eurocommercial 
carefully examined the core components of its 
business strategy, progressing their integration with 
the ESG strategy over the short, medium, and long 
term.

Report of the Board of Management 202358
In 2023, Eurocommercial took proactive steps in 
anticipation of upcoming European regulations, 
particularly the Corporate Sustainability Reporting 
Directive (CSRD). The CSRD, a regulatory 
framework aimed at strengthening corporate 
accountability and sustainability, requires 
companies to provide detailed disclosures 
regarding their sustainability and environmental 
impact within corporate reports. Eurocommercial is 
committed to aligning its 2024 ﬁnancial report with 
the CSRD regulations to enhance transparency and 
accountability in its sustainability efforts.
Recognising the importance of this directive for 
Eurocommercial, the ESG Committee has taken 
an active role in advancing its disclosure on ESG 
matters in the coming years. An integral part of 
this effort is the undertaking of a double materiality 
assessment, planned for completion in the ﬁrst half 
of 2024.
The double materiality assessment encompasses 
two distinct perspectives: impact materiality and 
ﬁnancial materiality. Impact materiality focuses 
on evaluating Eurocommercial’s inﬂuence on 
both people and the environment across various 
timeframes, considering factors such as scale, 
scope, and irreversibility of impact. In contrast, 
ﬁnancial materiality relates to sustainability matters 
that may affect the Company’s ﬁnancials, taking into 
account the likelihood of occurrence and the size of 
potential ﬁnancial effects.
Furthermore, in 2023, the Company began a peer 
analysis and stakeholder mapping exercise to gain 
deeper insights into the ESG priorities within the 
real estate market. Key stakeholders, including 
shareholders, tenants, banks, suppliers, and 
property management companies with whom 
Eurocommercial collaborates closely, have been 
identiﬁed. Qualitative interviews were conducted in 
the ﬁrst quarter of 2024 and will be followed by a 
quantitative assessment through an online survey, 
with active leadership from the ESG Committee.
The latter half of 2024 will be dedicated to 
preparing the organisation for further reﬁnement 
of its ESG strategy, updating internal policies, 
and collecting necessary data. The outcomes of 
the double materiality analysis will be presented 
in our 2024 annual report, demonstrating our 
commitment to sustainability and transparency in 
line with regulatory requirements and stakeholder 
expectations.

Environmental, Social and Governance (continued)
Increased sustainability brings ﬁnancial beneﬁts, 
like lower operating costs for energy-efﬁcient 
buildings, resulting in higher net income. Corporate 
sustainability initiatives enhance reputation and 
attract customers and investors. Overall, it is 
clear that improved sustainability is an important 
measure of Eurocommercial’s future success. 
Action is needed to reduce pollution, conserve 
resources, and improve efﬁciency for long-term 
viability. With the right strategies and investments, 
Eurocommercial can further drive growth and 
success.
Drivers for 
ESG Description
Eurocommercial’s management 
approach
Carefully 
monitor and 
manage ESG 
related risks
Continuously assess potential risks and 
opportunities posed by climate change, 
which can affect our properties and 
communities. The investment community 
requires increased transparency 
regarding the potential ﬁnancial 
consequences of climate change.
In 2023, Eurocommercial commenced thorough 
property assessments conducted by external 
experts to identify potential physical climate change 
risks impacting our organisation. Detailed reports 
were received outlining strategies to mitigate 
these risks in the near future. Mitigation plans are 
integrated into property-level business plans.
Ensuring health and safety and 
enhancing measures at our shopping 
centres remains a top priority. The indoor 
environmental quality has gained added 
signiﬁcance in recent times. It is important 
to uphold the highest standards for the 
comfort and well-being of our customers, 
tenants, and employees.
At our shopping centres, all Health & Safety 
requirements are met, and further investments are 
made in monitoring tools such as CO² meters to 
constantly check air quality inside our premises. 
Furthermore, customers’ comfort and satisfaction 
with their journey through our centres are monitored.
Efﬁcient use of 
resources
Reducing operational expenses for 
our tenants to enable them to run 
their businesses at lower costs, while 
also offering energy-efﬁcient, more 
sustainable retail spaces.
In 2023, commitment remained strong to 
implementing signiﬁcant measures to enhance 
energy efﬁciency and decrease the carbon footprint. 
Investments such as solar panels, LED lights, 
upgraded Building Management Systems, and 
advanced monitoring tools like smart metering 
enable sustained reasonable energy costs and 
savings.
As a responsible owner, it is imperative 
to offer shopping centres with efﬁcient 
waste management, water conservation, 
biodiversity, material usage, sustainable 
transportation, etc.
Eurocommercial is proactively engaged in the 
maintenance or pursuit of recertiﬁcation for 
BREEAM In-Use certiﬁcates across all its shopping 
centres. These certiﬁcations provide the teams 
with guidelines to regularly measure and compare 
assets in order to reduce carbon emissions, energy 
consumption, waste, conserve water, focus on using 
safer materials, and minimise pollution.
Why ESG matters for Eurocommercial
For the past three decades, Eurocommercial has 
been dedicated to promoting ESG through various 
initiatives. The Company aims to beneﬁt stakeholders 
by investing in retail properties and fostering 
community gathering places. The goal is to provide 
opportunities for entrepreneurs to connect with their 
audience and generate income, ensuring sustainable 
ﬁnancial and social returns for shareholders. 
Eurocommercial must strive for greater sustainability 
in the future due to population growth and climate 
change effects. It is crucial for businesses to reduce 
environmental impact and operate responsibly, 
especially for Eurocommercial, owning and operating 
retail properties across Europe.

Report of the Board of Management 2023 61
To comply 
with evolving 
regulations
European regulations provide a 
roadmap to a low-carbon economy 
which will require our organisation to 
improve transparency and comply with 
external reporting requirements (such 
as the EU Taxonomy and the Corporate 
Sustainability Reporting Directive).
Eurocommercial has taken meticulous steps in 2023 
to prepare its external reporting to align with the 
upcoming EU regulations. The ESG Committee will 
continue in 2024 to prepare future ﬁnancial reporting 
to adequately align with these new standards.
We adhere to stricter national and local 
environmental legislations and adapt 
our properties to comply with changing 
building codes that support the low-
carbon initiatives of national governments 
and to improve energy efﬁciency in order 
to reduce carbon emissions and upgrade 
Energy Performance Certiﬁcates (EPC).
In 2023, a CRREM analysis was conducted for 18 
properties to gain insights into initiatives and required 
investments for aligning our portfolio with the Paris 
Accord carbon reduction target. The remaining 
properties will develop a CRREM pathway in 2024. 
Our aim is carbon neutrality in all scope 1 and 2 
emissions by 2030 and establishing a reduction 
target for scope 3 emissions soon. Additionally, 
Energy Performance Certiﬁcates are being updated 
to comply with national regulations.
Positive 
stakeholder 
engagement
To respond to evolving societal needs, 
such as the development of omnichannel 
retail and the changing customer journey, 
shopping centres are adapted to serve 
as retail destinations and community 
hubs, providing services and amenities to 
meet community demands.
In 2023, the Company conducted customer 
engagement surveys for 14 centres, with over 13,000 
customers providing valuable input, to continuously 
monitor the needs and satisfaction of this important 
stakeholder group. Outcomes are discussed within 
local teams and shared between countries to 
exchange best practices.
Having a good relationship with tenants 
is important to create a welcoming 
and enjoyable shopping experience for 
customers in our centres. Striving to 
work closely with retailers as business 
partners is essential.
Eurocommercial assesses tenant satisfaction 
levels through regular surveys and ongoing 
communication. Additionally, the introduction of a 
tenant app enhances communication, and Green 
Committees in our shopping centres promote 
sustainable practices. In 2024, tenant engagement 
surveys will be undertaken again as part of the 
biennial assessment process.
To maintain 
a positive 
reputation in 
the real estate 
market
Financial markets require sustainable 
investments. Sharing information and 
data is required to access funding in the 
form of green loans and bonds.
In 2022, Eurocommercial established a Green 
Finance Framework and integrated ESG factors into 
individual loans.
To become a preferred business 
partner and establish a reputation as 
a trustworthy, long-term real estate 
investor.
Our teams maintain long-term relationships with the 
main participants in their local markets including 
tenants, investors and ﬁnancing partners.

Environmental, Social and Governance (continued)
Recognition 
Eurocommercial is dedicated to annual reporting 
on its Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) 
performance. In 2023, the Company’s sustainability 
reporting efforts were recognized with the 
prestigious EPRA Gold Award, and it achieved its 
highest-ever score of 86 in the GRESB assessment, 
earning a Green Star and four-star position, 
aligning with industry best practices. Additionally, 
Eurocommercial’s commitment to ESG excellence 
led to its inclusion in both Euronext’s AMX® and 
AEX® ESG indices, effective from 19 September 
2022. These indices spotlight companies within 
the AEX® and AMX® indices showcasing top-tier 
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) 
practices, fostering the adoption of mainstream 
ESG investment approaches. 
Furthermore, in 2023 Eurocommercial made its 
inaugural participation in the Carbon Disclosure 
Project (CDP), receiving a commendable C 
level rating. The CDP, an annual disclosure 
project, allows companies to voluntarily report 
their environmental impacts and climate-related 
data to investors and stakeholders, enhancing 
transparency, accountability and sustainability 
practices.
Be green
The ‘Be Green’ pillar of Eurocommercial’s ESG 
strategy entails close collaboration with key 
stakeholders to tackle climate change, circularity, 
biodiversity, low-carbon transportation and pollution 
prevention. In 2023, Eurocommercial placed 
emphasis on evaluating the risks and opportunities 
associated with climate change and establishing 
decarbonisation pathways for its properties. By 
obtaining green building certiﬁcations such as 
BREEAM, the Company systematically monitors 
and improves its portfolio, thereby diminishing its 
environmental footprint.
Objective Status Key facts
Operate carbon neutral 
by 2030 (Scope 1 & 2)
On target 24% carbon emissions 
reduced vs. 2022.
Zero waste to landﬁll 
by 2030
On target 54% of assets with 
zero waste to landﬁll.
BREEAM certiﬁcations 
in place for all shopping 
centres by 2025
On target 85% of assets 
BREEAM certiﬁed.  
15% of the assets is in 
process of  
re-certiﬁcation.
Carbon neutral
Operating as a carbon-neutral company entails 
ensuring that our operations across all locations 
produce net zero carbon emissions, thereby 
making our direct impact emission-free. This 
encompasses leveraging efﬁcient energy 
management to inﬂuence energy source usage, 
prioritising the transition to renewable energy 
sources, particularly onsite generation where 
feasible.
In 2023, local teams began developing 
decarbonisation pathways using the Carbon 
Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) to prepare 
for carbon neutrality. Eighteen shopping centres 
have prepared decarbonisation pathways in 
2023, with the remaining centres to follow in 2024. 
These carbon reduction plans are based on clear, 
science-backed methods aligned with the Paris 
Climate Goals, aiming to limit global temperature 
rise to 1.5°C, with limitations of 2°C. Additional 
measures have been taken to collect tenant data 
(scope 3 carbon emissions) with the aim to review 
our carbon reduction commitment and extend this 
to incorporate scope 3 carbon emissions into our 
overall reduction target by 2050.
In 2022, we dismantled the gas plants at 
Collestrada and Curno, replacing them with highly 
efﬁcient, electricity fuelled plants, resulting in 
reduced direct carbon emissions for these centres 
in 2023. In February 2024 the gas plants at Il 
Castello were replaced by a district heating system 
of the Ferrara Municipality. Starting from March 
2024, all Italian shopping centres are purchasing 
electricity 100% from renewable sources with 
contracts provided with the Guarantee of Origin 

Page 11:
Eurocommercial Properties N.V.
Report of the Board of Management 2023 65
(GO). Consequently, 15 assets no longer rely on 
gas as the primary source for heating or cooling. 
Additionally, 9 assets have initiatives in place to 
eliminate gas usage from the centres by 2030.
Short term actions identiﬁed (0-5 years) to reduce our 
carbon emissions: 
• Deﬁne adaptation and mitigation actions to reduce 
climate change risks.
• Complete CRREM pathways for all assets and 
deﬁne investments according to stranding dates 
• Introduce smart metering for all areas in the 
shopping centres 
• Initiate methodology to calculate embodied carbon 
• Set carbon reduction target (scope 3 emissions) 
• Recertify properties with latest BREEAM In-Use 
with ratings no lower than Very Good 
Green building certiﬁcation
The Company continues to use green building 
certiﬁcation as part of its Environmental Management 
System (EMS). This certiﬁcation process assists 
our local teams in improving their understanding 
of the objectives and creates a uniform approach 
to management across the portfolio, developing 
programmes to reduce environmental impact. 
All the shopping centres under the Company’s 
management have obtained a BREEAM In-Use 
certiﬁcation or are in the process of recertiﬁcation. 
This is well ahead of the 2025 Group target, and 
the Company will continue to recertify its centres 
in the coming years. Bergvik, Hallarna, Ingelsta, 
Grand Samarkland and Collestrada have renewed 
their BREEAM In-Use certiﬁcates against the 
latest version (v6.0) of BREEAM In-Use. In 2023 
we completed the pre-assessment activity to re-
certify Carosello, I Gigli, Curno, Portali, Castello and 
Cremona Po; the certiﬁcation process is underway 
and will be obtained by Q2 2024 with expected 
Very Good ratings for Castello and Cremona Po, 
and Excellent ratings for Carosello, I Gigli, Curno 
and I Portali.
Energy management
In 2023, Eurocommercial continued to utilise 
its internal Environmental Management System 
(EMS), adhering to ISO14001 procedures to 
ensure alignment with internationally recognised 
environmental management standards. 
This streamlined system enables consistent 
implementation of measures, including data 
collection and the establishment of concise 
reduction targets across all local teams. Regular 
reporting of progress to senior management 
remains a key feature of our EMS framework.

In line with Eurocommercial’s commitment to 
innovation, smart meters for tenants have been 
installed. As from January 2024, all smart meters 
are fully operational, allowing the local team to track 
energy usage in all areas directly managed or where 
electricity is distributed.
A comprehensive CRREM analysis has been 
conducted, covering scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. 
This analysis has provided valuable insights, informing 
internal communication regarding needed investments 
and leading to the development of a decarbonisation 
roadmap.
Looking ahead, plans are in place for the recertiﬁcation 
of the property under the BREEAM certiﬁcation 
scheme in 2024. This ongoing commitment to 
sustainability underscores Eurocommercial’s 
dedication to environmental stewardship, ensuring 
that Woluwe Shopping continues to operate as a 
sustainable and energy-efﬁcient property.
FRANCE
In France, signiﬁcant progress has been 
made towards sustainability goals in 2023. A 
comprehensive decarbonisation roadmap has 
been developed for two properties, Les Portes de 
Taverny and Passage du Havre, outlining pathways 
to reduce scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions by 2050. For 
the other French assets, similar pathways will be 
developed in 2024.
To reduce the carbon footprint, the team has taken 
actions such as the installation of over 600 solar 
panels at Etrembières shopping centre, covering 
1,200 m². BREEAM recertiﬁcation efforts are 
ongoing at Les Atlantes and Etrembières, with all 
other assets scheduled for recertiﬁcation by the end 
of 2024, aligning with the Group’s long-term target 
by 2025. Furthermore, a social risk assessment 
initiative has been launched to understand and 
address social risks and opportunities across 
assets.
ITALY
A Climate Risk Assessment was conducted for all 
Italian assets by a third-party expert, providing clear 
insight into potential physical risks such as drought, 
strong winds, tornadoes, and heavy rainfall. Asset-
level action plans have been developed and budget 
Eurocommercial organised internal environmental 
training and awareness workshops in 2023, 
collaborating with its ESG Working Group and ESG 
Committee to enhance awareness and knowledge.
A formal environmental policy covering energy 
management is publicly available on the 
corporate website, clearly outlining the roles 
and responsibilities of those accountable for the 
internal EMS. Each asset has its own energy 
reduction action plan, integrated into the annual 
business plan. These action plans are developed 
and implemented by local teams. In 2023, 
Eurocommercial’s total energy consumption in its 
shopping centres decreased by 15% compared to 
the previous year on a comparable property basis. 
To streamline our data collection process, countries 
continued to utilise smart metering, with country-
speciﬁc tools in place to aggregate consumptions. 
Energy audits were incorporated into the 
programme of work where CRREM assessments 
were conducted, and dedicated plans have been 
developed to further minimise energy usage, 
aligning the properties with the carbon pathway.
BELGIUM
The team at Woluwe Shopping has remained 
steadfast in its commitment to reducing the 
environmental footprint of the property, implementing 
a range of initiatives in 2023. The near completion of 
the Building Management System (BMS) represents 
a signiﬁcant milestone for Eurocommercial and will 
enhance monitoring capabilities, enabling more 
efﬁcient energy management going forward.
Additionally, Eurocommercial also announced the 
successful ﬁnalisation of the LED programme at 
Woluwe Shopping. With 100% LED lighting now 
operational in all common areas, this signiﬁcant 
upgrade has resulted in a noticeable reduction in 
energy usage throughout the property. The installation 
of CO² sensors has provided valuable insights into 
the real need for fresh air in all areas of the property, 
allowing the local team to implement targeted air 
conditioning measures and potentially achieve energy 
savings. Furthermore, Eurocommercial has replaced 
one cooling tower with a new, more efﬁcient model. 
This upgrade not only contributes to sustainability 
efforts but also results in signiﬁcant water and energy 
savings for the property.

Eurocommercial Properties N.V.
Report of the Board of Management 2023 67
allocations made to mitigate these risks, including 
installing waterprooﬁng and insulation layers on 
roofs to protect against water damage and improve 
building performance. These measures not only 
address climate change risks but also contribute 
to reducing energy usage, carbon emissions, and 
improving overall system efﬁciency. Energy savings 
in 2023 have already reached 19% in comparison 
to 2022, thanks to solar panels, gas dismissal, 
revamping of mechanical systems and LED 
relamping.
The Italian team continued to invest in on-site solar 
energy for two properties in 2023, with I Gigli and 
Carosello now generating renewable electricity for 
over 50% of their common area needs. Additionally, 
smart metering installations were completed to 
monitor tenant consumption across all properties, 
providing valuable data to better understand and 
manage energy usage.
A decarbonisation roadmap has been developed 
using the CRREM tool for all Italian assets. These 
assessments evaluated the current performance 
of the Italian shopping centres based on CRREM 
2.0 °C (SSP2 – 4.5 scenario) decarbonisation 
pathway and considering emissions of Scope 1 and 
2. The Italian portfolio is already aligned with the 
long-term decarbonisation pathway, although it will 
be necessary to make additional improvements in 
order to avoid future stranding point of the assets. In 
addition, Scope 3 emissions will be included in the 
analysis in order to complete the assessments. 
Regarding waste management, in 2023 
waste audits were conducted to improve the 
differentiation, data collection and eliminate the 
disposal to landﬁll at Collestrada and I Gigli. As a 
result, several improvements have been performed, 
and an agreement with private waste companies 
are underway to reach the “zero waste to landﬁll” 
target for the whole Italian portfolio by 2026. 
Investments in system renovation also continued, 
with plans to phase out gas usage in I Portali 
and Carosello by 2024 and 2025 respectively, 
resulting in lower direct carbon emissions for these 
properties. BREEAM recertiﬁcation is underway for 
ﬁve assets, of which three will achieve BREEAM 
Excellent ratings.
On 22 March 2023, Eurocommercial unveiled 
“Off the Wall,” a mural created by renowned street 
artist Alessio B, located in the covered car park 
of Carosello shopping centre. This mural marks 
one of the ﬁrst eco-friendly installations in an Italian 
shopping centre, covering an area of 35 m² and 
crafted with Airlite, an innovative photocatalytic paint 
capable of absorbing air pollution generated by 
79 vehicles. Developed in collaboration with Air Is 
Art, a project dedicated to merging sustainable art 
with cultural communities, the initiative aims to raise 
awareness about air quality by creating murals and 
green artworks using Airlite paints. The Carosello 
mural exempliﬁes this sustainable art initiative, 
designed to enhance indoor air quality and promote 
wellbeing within the mall environment.
SWEDEN
BREEAM recertiﬁcation is currently underway 
and is expected to achieve at least a Very Good 
rating. A decarbonisation roadmap has been 
developed using the CRREM tool for all Swedish 
assets. The Swedish portfolio is already aligned 
with the long-term decarbonisation pathway, 
so it will primarily focus on continuing to reduce 
energy usage where possible. Notably, energy 
savings have already reached 6.5% without major 
investments, leveraging existing systems in Sweden 
for streamlined reporting. 
The team continued its ongoing programme to 
relamp all centres to 100% LED during 2023. 
Additionally, tenants are encouraged to transition 
to LED lighting and reduce store lighting hours. For 
instance, stores are advised not to illuminate upon 
staff arrival but rather when open to the public.
A comprehensive climate risk assessment has been 
conducted for all Swedish assets, leading to the 
development of action plans based on key ﬁndings. 
While there may be an increased risk of heatwaves 
post-2030, current systems are anticipated to 
accommodate any additional energy demand 
during such events.
Tenant education and engagement initiatives have 
been implemented, including regular night walks 
followed by action plans. This communication focus 
for 2023 emphasises the importance of replacing

tenant lighting to LED, ensuring clarity and ease of 
understanding for all tenants. A green committee 
was initiated in 2023 in Grand Samarkand. All seven 
assets will have similar initiatives in place to engage 
with their tenants in 2024.
Climate change risk assessment
Eurocommercial takes the risks and opportunities of 
climate change seriously. To ensure that its shopping 
centre renewable energy initiatives remain a priority, 
Eurocommercial explores opportunities to install 
solar panels on top of its shopping centres and 
parking areas. The Company conducted on-site risk 
assessments, partnering with specialists in order to 
identify risks and procedures to mitigate the effects of 
climate change. Stakeholders expect transparency 
regarding potential climate-related risks and 
opportunities. 
Governance
Eurocommercial’s governance structure prioritises 
climate change management with a uniﬁed, pan-
European approach overseen by the ESG Committee 
and supported by our local country teams through the 
ESG Working Group. This Committee, responsible for 
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters, 
guides the evaluation of climate-related risks and 
opportunities. An independent climate risk assessment, 
authorised by the Committee, was conducted by 
country teams to comprehensively understand 
potential risks facing the Company. Subsequently, the 
Committee communicates assessment results to the 
Supervisory Board and investors.
The ESG Committee is tasked with integrating transition 
and physical climate risks into Eurocommercial’s 
broader business processes and procedures in the 
upcoming years. Additionally, the ESG Working Group 
members oversee the assessment and prioritisation 
of adaptation and mitigation plans at the asset level, 
addressing both physical and transition risks. Their 
responsibilities also include integrating outcomes from 
climate change risk assessments into business and 
ﬁnancial planning activities.
Strategy
In 2022, Eurocommercial initiated a comprehensive 
climate change risk assessment at the Group level. 
Partnering with third-party experts in each country, the 
Company utilised advanced climate models to evaluate 
physical climate change risks. These assessments 
encompassed acute risks such as tornadoes, 
landslides, wildﬁres, and ﬂoods, as well as chronic 
risks like sea level rise and changes in precipitation 
patterns. The outcomes of these assessments include 
recommended actions to mitigate potential impacts on 
our properties and the surrounding communities.
In 2023, Eurocommercial conducted an assessment 
of the ﬁnancial implications of signiﬁcant physical 
climate change risks and prepared action plans to 
reduce potential impacts. Country teams collaborated 
with third-party experts to identify potential physical 
risks affecting the assets and conducted site visits to 
understand the possible impacts of climate-related 
events. Dedicated asset-level action plans focusing 
on adaptation to these physical risks were developed, 
with the ﬁrst 15 assets incorporating these plans into 
their business strategies. Budgets were allocated for 
follow-up studies or adaptive measures to minimise 
potential impacts.
Eurocommercial aims to recertify all shopping 
centres with BREEAM In-Use (v6.0), a green building 
certiﬁcation incorporating climate change adaptation 
criteria, within the next 24 months. By 2025, the 
Company aims to certify 100% of its portfolio with 
BREEAM v6.0 or an even more updated protocol, 
ensuring that all properties are assessed for potential 
climate change risks. The adaptation criteria within 
BREEAM recognise and encourage measures to 
mitigate the impact of extreme weather events resulting 
from climate change throughout the building’s lifespan.
Additionally, Eurocommercial evaluated transition risks 
related to policy and legal, technology, and reputation 
aspects, assessing their potential ﬁnancial impact 
on the Company. These transition risks may arise as 
Eurocommercial transitions towards a lower-carbon 
economy. The outcomes of the initial assessment 
provided insights for future decision-making regarding 
short-term (0-5 years), medium-term (5-10 years), and 
long-term (over 10 years) risks. Ongoing monitoring 
and risk assessment will determine the Company’s 
response and property management strategy.

As a member of the real estate 
industry, it is our aim to be transparent 
about our impact and play a role 
in the transition to a low-carbon 
economy. Creating awareness among 
our communities and educating our 
partners on their responsibilities are 
critical steps taken (see Formalising

S / M / L If not adopting more 
ESG conscious business 
practices, bank ﬁnance 
may be more scarce.
Eurocommercial Properties 
developed a Green Finance 
Framework and began incorporating 
environmental and social criteria into 
loan agreements (refer to Sustainable 
Finance section).
For our climate change strategy, Eurocommercial 
has utilised the Representative Concentration 
Pathway (RCP) 4.5, a scenario of long-term global 
emissions outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change (IPCC). Climate scenario 
analysis enables companies to anticipate and 
address the impacts of climate change on their 
business models by systematically exploring various 
potential futures to identify the most pertinent risks 
and opportunities.
Risk management
Eurocommercial assesses potential physical and 
transition risks related to climate change through 
a collaborative process involving input from local 
teams, corporate headquarters, and third-party 
technical advisors. The Company utilises local 
expertise, engages and educates teams, reports 
the process and results, and secures support 
and resources from senior management to 
effectively manage climate change risks. In 2022, 
Eurocommercial conducted an initial study to 
understand the physical risks posed by climate 
change to its assets by reviewing information from 
relevant websites and databases. The climate risk 
assessment included evaluating transition risks. 
Input was solicited from local teams and senior 
management to determine the potential likelihood 
and impact of each risk on the organisation. Based 
on these initial results, asset-level physical risk 
assessments were undertaken for the shopping 
centre portfolio in 2023 to understand not only 
the potential risk based on location, but also 
the complete impact of each risk on building 
infrastructure and the adaptive measures that can 
be taken to further reduce this risk.

Climate change – actions taken 
a thorough climate risk assessment in 2023, leading to the development 
of an action plan to address climate-related challenges. The plan includes 
measures to enhance resilience against extreme heat, such as creating 
green roofs, increasing greenery, and transforming roof surfaces. To 
mitigate ﬂooding risks, efforts include installing stormwater buffer zones 
and inﬁltration basins, as well as making soil permeable. Studies are also 
underway to protect technical installations from potential ﬂood impacts. 
Additionally, plans for drought conditions involve installing grey and rainwater 
recovery systems.
In Hallarna, Sweden, Eurocommercial is proactively implementing measures 
to protect the property against potential climate-related risks. To safeguard 
against surface water ﬂooding, various actions are being taken, including 
regular gutter cleaning and considering reactive defence mechanisms 
to pump out collected water. Investigations are also underway to assess 
drainage connections and explore installing diversion pipes to redirect 
excess water. Furthermore, measures to mitigate heatwave impacts include 
evaluating solar shading for windows and assessing the cooling system’s 
capability to manage extended heatwaves. Plans are also being made to 
review glazed ceilings or install solar shading during renovations to mitigate 
heat build-up. 
On 3 November 2023, I Gigli in Italy faced severe storms, resulting 
in ﬂooding in the surrounding area near Florence. Eurocommercial’s 
management team promptly responded to the emergency, activating the 
Centre Emergency Plan for ﬂooding events. Immediate actions included 
closing the four basement escape routes, which were inundated with water, 
and implementing compensatory measures. Following the ﬂooding, the 
team initiated cleaning and repair efforts to restore the property. Assistance 
was provided to affected retailers, facilitating their recovery and clean-up 
operations. Remarkably, I Gigli reopened on 4 November, with 97 shops 
operational, and by 6 November all shops were fully operational, albeit 
with some limitations. Costs associated with the event primarily focused 
on cleaning activities, such as mud and water removal, elevator repairs, 
and ﬂoor restoration. Fortunately, the existing insurance coverage proved 
adequate to address the damages incurred. Eurocommercial’s proactive 
approach and swift response mitigated the impact of the event enabling the 
centre to reopen promptly and resume operations.

Metrics and targets
Eurocommercial has set ambitious targets to 
reduce carbon emissions, minimise waste sent to 
landﬁll, and obtain green building certiﬁcations in 
the near future. This implies that the Company will 
operate more efﬁciently and generate fewer carbon 
emissions than emitted, on an absolute basis. 
By reaching its goals, Eurocommercial aims to 
reduce its exposure to the transition to low carbon 
properties, meet government mandates, and lower 
operational costs due to limited use of natural 
resources. A range of metrics is utilised to assess 
exposure to identiﬁed short-term climate-related 
risks and opportunities.

To operate its properties efﬁciently, 
Eurocommercial implements international 
green building certiﬁcations, lowering its 
environmental impact.
Renewable energy
Renewable energy initiatives remain a focal point 
as Eurocommercial explores opportunities to 
install solar panels on top of its shopping centres 
and parking areas. 10 assets have on-site solar 
panels, collectively generating over 3,980 MWh 
electricity in 2023. Sweden leads the way, with all 
seven shopping centres equipped with solar panels 
producing 3,396 MWh, equivalent to approximately 
20% of their electricity usage. 
Woluwe Shopping in Belgium provides over 1,700 
solar panels generating 460 MWh of renewable 
electricity, constituting more than 28% of the total 
usage in common areas. In Italy, investments 
in on-site solar panels have been made in ﬁve 
centres, including newly installed systems at I Gigli 
and Carosello at the end of 2023. Additionally, 
the Etrembières shopping centre in France was 
equipped with solar panels on its roof.
These projects contribute signiﬁcantly to 
sustainability efforts, reducing our carbon footprint 
while providing a dependable source of renewable 
electricity. Our commitment to sustainability extends 
further with plans for continued investment in 
sustainable solutions, aimed at positively impacting 
the environment. Moreover, our procurement 
of electricity from 100% renewable sources 
underscores our dedication to sustainable 
practices. In 2023, 23 of our assets sourced 
electricity from renewable sources.
Connectivity and accessibility
Connectivity to public transport serves as a 
fundamental component of Eurocommercial’s 
ESG strategy and overall business approach, 
supporting its commitment to communities and 
the environment. Visitors and employees are 
encouraged to utilise public transport for accessing 
our shopping centres, which are integrated 
into local public transport networks. During 
extensions and ground-up retail development 
projects, Eurocommercial collaborates with 
local municipalities to enhance public transport 
integration and centre accessibility. Recognising the 
importance of reducing private car usage, electrical 
shuttle buses will be provided for centres located 
more than one kilometre from public transport in 
the future. Additionally, affordable and eco-friendly 
transport options, including electric vehicle parking, 
charging stations, and designated areas for low-
emission cars, car-sharing, bicycle parking, and 
other amenities are offered. Eurocommercial’s 
centres prioritise accessibility for pedestrians and 
individuals with disabilities, ensuring ease of access 
for all.
EV charging stations have been introduced in 
our markets, with plans for expansion in Belgium, 
where twelve EV chargers are in place, and Italy, 
with eight assets providing charging stations 
for 30 cars. In 2023, France had ﬁve centres 
providing 46 charging stations for our visitors, and 

Page 20:
Eurocommercial Properties N.V.
Report of the Board of Management 202374
in Sweden, the additional rollout of these stations 
led to a capacity for 127 vehicles. As part of our 
ongoing commitment to fostering environmentally-
friendly transportation options, Woluwe Shopping 
organised a test drive event. From 18 to 21 October 
2023, in partnership with Le Moniteur Automobile 
and Interparking, Woluwe Shopping hosted the 
Test Drive Days event, featuring the presence of 
automotive experts from the magazine. Aimed at 
promoting sustainable mobility, the event offered 
visitors the opportunity to test drive a selection of 14 
electric and hybrid car models from six renowned 
brands. Registration for participation was free and 
simple, granting access to up to four test drives per 
person, with editorial experts available to provide 
guidance and advice.
Zero waste
In order to manage waste efﬁciently, 
Eurocommercial is increasing recycling and 
reducing the amount of waste going directly to 
landﬁll. The Company invests in cost-effective 
waste services for its tenants, encouraging them 
to have their own programme to handle waste 
efﬁciently. Eurocommercial aims to minimise the 
waste it produces and eliminate waste to landﬁll 
by 2030. Working closely with waste services and 
local authorities, 58% of Eurocommercial’s centres 
already achieved the zero waste to landﬁll goal 
during 2023. Over the 2023 reporting period, 8% of 
waste was send to landﬁlls.
Cooperation with tenants and waste management 
providers is a key aspect of ensuring a high recycling 
rate at Eurocommercial’s shopping centres. Waste 
data is collected and analysed quarterly, with reports 
provided to the ESG Committee. The Company’s 
yearly report includes waste data, and action plans 
are developed and implemented for every asset.
Multiple initiatives are in place across 
Eurocommercial to create awareness and stimulate 
recycling efforts. In collaboration with Archeplastica, 
Eurocommercial has extended “The Plastic Age” 
educational project to four of its eight Italian 
shopping centres, including Il Castello. This initiative 
aims to raise awareness about plastic usage 
within the centres, aligning with Eurocommercial’s 
commitment to sustainability. At Il Castello, where 
a recent transition to district heating have been 
made, the event showcases 50 artefacts from 
“Archeoplastica” alongside an augmented reality 
area and three LED walls displaying videos from 
Archeoplastica’s social media channels. The launch 
of the event included a press conference attended 
by local media, the University of Ferrara, and the 
Chemistry Faculty, with participation from schools, 
Legambiente, and HERA in various activities. To 
further engage with the community, Eurocommercial 
introduced Sgasman, a sustainability character 
portrayed by comedian Andrea Poltronieri, who 
promotes sustainability and energy-saving practices 
through videos broadcasted on the Company’s 
social media platforms.

Water conservation 
Water conservation is a priority for Eurocommercial, 
where efforts are focused on reducing consumption 
and waste in collaboration with tenants. In 2023, 
water consumption remained stable compared to 
the previous year (like-for-like). To further mitigate 
environmental impact, greywater is utilised for 
irrigation purposes. The Company is actively 
investing in water conservation initiatives, including 
the installation of water taps with sensors to regulate 
usage and the implementation of double ﬂush toilets. 
Additionally, plans are underway to enhance water 
storage facilities to address potential drought issues, 
such as the addition of water storage systems, 
rainwater collection tanks, and new water wells.
Biodiversity 
Eurocommercial is committed to enhancing 
biodiversity and ecological values as part of its 
Be Green strategy. Our goal is to create green 
infrastructure that provides connections to nature for 
our customers and local communities, promoting a 
healthy and sustainable lifestyle. Through initiatives 
such as installing beehives, insect hotels, and nest 
boxes on the roofs of multiple shopping centres, the 
Company aims to support local ecosystems and 
increase biodiversity.
The BREEAM In-Use assessment is utilised to 
evaluate our impact, and a third-party ecologist 
has been appointed to conduct biodiversity 
assessments every three years. The ﬁndings are 
used to prepare action plans. Continuous monitoring 
ensures that biodiversity initiatives effectively 
contribute to the preservation of local ecosystems. 
To raise awareness, information displays have been 
set up in various centres, including Grand A, Les 
Portes de Taverny, Shopping Etrembières, and 
Passage du Havre.

Customer engagement
Customer engagement lies at the heart of our 
approach at Eurocommercial. The Company 
prioritises aligning its centres with the evolving 
needs of both tenants and customers through 
robust engagement and communication strategies. 
Regular customer surveys, satisfaction tracking, 
and ongoing adaptations based on customer 
preferences are fundamental to our methodology. 
Throughout 2023, over 13,000 in-person interviews 
were conducted across 14 centres, resulting in a 
notable increase in overall customer satisfaction, 
with an impressive average score of 8.3. The 
objective is to ensure that each shopping centre 
within the portfolio maintains a minimum satisfaction 
score of 7.5 by 2025. Additionally, the Net Promoter 
Score (NPS) is utilised to gauge customer loyalty, 
with targeted action plans implemented to further 
enhance customer satisfaction and bolster the 
reputation of the shopping centres. The average 
NPS score in 2023 was 37.
Passage du Havre and Carosello exemplify the 
commitment to enhancing customer satisfaction. 
Passage du Havre achieved a remarkable increase 
in its NPS score by 10 points, attributed to a 
revitalised tenant mix that drove increased foot 
trafﬁc and enhanced centre appreciation. Initiatives 
such as the introduction of a comedy club have 
further contributed to transforming the centre’s 
image positively.
Meanwhile, at Carosello, a noteworthy improvement 
in engagement scores was observed, rising from 
8.3 to 8.6, alongside a substantial increase in NPS 
from 43 to 65. Despite a decline in visitor numbers 
since 2019, the feedback from current visitors 
underscores their heightened loyalty and increased 
appreciation for the centre. This shift reﬂects a 
departure from detractors and neutrals, indicating a 
more focused and satisﬁed customer base.
Genuine retailer partnerships 
At Eurocommercial, retailer partnerships are 
fundamental to our success. The Company 
actively seeks out feedback from retailers to identify 
opportunities for enhancement, fostering genuine 
collaboration and mutual growth. The commitment 
to transparency and improvement is reﬂected in the 
consistent exchange of data and regular monitoring 
of retailer satisfaction through anonymous surveys. 
In 2022, an impressive average tenant satisfaction 
score of 7.0 was achieved, based on feedback 
from 1,092 participating tenants across all shopping 
centres. With engagement surveys conducted 
across the entire portfolio, the goal is to maintain the 
average satisfaction score to 7.0 by 2025.
In 2023, dedicated improvement plans were 
implemented, including the introduction of a tenant 
app to facilitate enhanced communications. These 
initiatives underscore the proactive approach to 
nurturing strong and enduring partnerships with 
retailers. As Eurocommercial looks ahead to 2024, 
the Company remains committed to ongoing 
engagement with tenants, with plans to conduct 
comprehensive tenant surveys to continually 
monitor and address their evolving needs and 
expectations.
Green collaboration with retailers
Our Group Green Lease policy serves as 
the cornerstone for collaboration between 
Eurocommercial and our tenants. We seek 
to exchange ESG ambitions, targets and 
responsibilities with our tenants to continue to 
develop sustainable centres with a clear vision and 
transparency to our stakeholders. To ensure we 
preserve our natural environment and achieve our 
ESG objectives, we want our business partners to 
adhere to the following ESG principles: 
•  Contributing to our carbon neutrality goal by 2030 
•  Reducing energy and water consumption 
•  Eliminating or reducing production of waste and 
single-use items such as plastic and packaging 
•  Sharing information, setting targets, and 
implementing best practices to track and improve 
performance 
•  Incorporating responsible procurement practices 
•  Encouraging the use of sustainable transportation 
for customers and employees.
At the start of 2021, our teams began to implement 
the revised Group Green Lease clauses. By the end 
of 2023, we achieved a green lease coverage of 
41% in Belgium, 52% in Italy, 51% in Sweden, and 
64% in France.

Green Committees that meet annually, inviting 
all tenants to attend. These meetings provide 
the opportunity to work together to reduce the 
environmental impact of the centres, discuss 
energy and water consumption, waste records, 
and best environmental practices. In Belgium, the 
Green Committee was established in 2022. The 
local team presented the action plan to reduce 
energy consumption in common areas encouraging 
tenants to do the same in their retail spaces. In 
2023, we are launching the Green Committee in 
Sweden to formally collaborate on environmental 
initiatives.
Eurocommercial Retail Academy® 
The Eurocommercial Retail Academy® was 
established in Sweden in 2017 with the vision of 
offering an engaging educational programme 
to enhance expertise and training in sales and 
customer service. Designed to cultivate a team 
of dedicated professionals capable of catering 
to customers’ growing demand for personalised 
service, the curriculum comprised four physical 
sessions annually, conducted before opening 
hours, and featured external lecturers specialising in 
sales techniques.
In collaboration with IHM Business School in 
Sweden, an online platform was developed, 
enabling retailers to continue training staff through 
video tutorials, questionnaires, and online games to 
assess skills. Initially accessible only in our Swedish 
shopping centres, the Eurocommercial Retail 
Academy® expanded its reach in 2023.
Partnering with Made to Sell, a specialised training 
provider, the Academy was introduced to eight 
additional centres, including three in France 
(Passage du Havre, Les Portes de Taverny, 
and Grand A) and ﬁve in Italy (I Portali, Curno, 
CremonaPo, Collestrada, and Fiordaliso). While 
participation varied across locations, the response 
in Italy was particularly encouraging, prompting 
plans for programme expansion leveraging tools like 
ECP Connect.
The corporate ESG target for 2023 was 
successfully achieved, thanks to the dedicated 
efforts invested in the rollout of Made to Sell as part 
of the Retail Academy. Eurocommercial will evaluate 
how to strengthen its relationship with retailers in the 
coming years to further enhance the programme’s 
effectiveness and impact.
Meanwhile, during the pause in training activities, 
Sweden utilised the opportunity to revamp the 
curriculum and platform content, incorporating new 
videos, experiences, and questionnaires. Set to 
resume in 2024, the refreshed programme reﬂects 
Eurocommercial’s commitment to continuous 
improvement and excellence in customer service 
training.
Responsible partners 
Eurocommercial values responsible partnerships, 
collaborating closely with trusted suppliers to 
uphold sustainable procurement practices tailored 
to each country’s regulations and standards. The 
Supplier Code of Conduct, accessible on the 
corporate website, serves as the cornerstone of the 
procurement process, providing clear directives on 
quality, innovation, and creativity.
Actively pursuing energy efﬁciency improvements, 
Eurocommercial selects low-consumption and 
renewable energy solutions while prioritising local 
businesses to support regional employment and 
minimise transportation and packaging impacts. 
Meticulously selecting building materials and 
maintenance products, Eurocommercial prioritises 
those with sustainability credentials, emphasising 
waste reduction and pollution risk mitigation.
Identifying chemicals and materials with potential 
environmental hazards, Eurocommercial handles 
them with utmost care, ensuring compliance 
with regulations and proper recycling or disposal. 
Through comprehensive staff training and 
emergency protocols, the team is equipped to 
handle these products safely and effectively, 
mitigating risks to both personnel and the 
environment.
Suppliers are held to high standards, mandated 
to uphold safety regulations and provide working 
conditions that prioritise health, comfort, and 
hygiene, aligning with the Company’s social and 
societal commitments.

Our teams 
At Eurocommercial, a commitment exists to 
fostering a fair and inclusive work environment 
where every employee receives equal opportunities 
and feels valued and empowered to perform 
at their best. The teams, spread across various 
locations in Belgium, France, Italy, and Sweden, 
handle all property and asset management 
functions, including leasing, rent collection, technical 
supervision and administration. Embracing diversity 
in nationality, age, and gender, pride is taken in the 
collegial and welcoming culture cultivated, where 
employees are encouraged to share best practices 
at regular group meetings spanning different 
departments. The dedication of team members is 
highly valued, as evidenced by the Company’s low 
employee turnover rate of 14% and a relatively low 
sickness ratio of 3.5%. Striving for gender balance, 
Eurocommercial believes in enriching its culture and 
reﬂecting the diversity of its customers through a 
balanced ratio of men and women.
Diverse teams
Eurocommercial values the diversity of its workforce 
as a signiﬁcant asset. The Company’s ﬁrm 
commitment to equal opportunity in all aspects of 
employment is unwavering, and any form of illegal 
discrimination or harassment is unequivocally 
prohibited. This includes derogatory comments 
based on racial or ethnic characteristics, as well 
as unwelcome sexual advances. In 2023, the 
team comprised 97 employees across Belgium, 
France, Italy, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the 
Netherlands. Among the staff, 57% are female, 43% 
male, with 4% below the age of 30. Additionally, 61% 
fall between the ages of 30 and 50, while 35% are 
over 50 years old.
Eurocommercial strictly prohibits discrimination 
based on personal characteristics such as age, 
disability, race, religion, gender, ethnic origin, family 
status, social origin, or sexual orientation. These 
principles extend to all aspects of employment, 
including recruitment, job assignments, promotions, 
remuneration, training, and beneﬁts. The aim is to 
foster an inclusive work environment where talent is 
nurtured, and decisions are merit-based. Any form 
of harassment or abusive behaviour is not tolerated 
within the Company. Eurocommercial is committed 
to transparency regarding its diversity indicators and 
regularly reports on metrics such as the gender pay 
gap and training hours by gender, which show no 
signiﬁcant disparities between genders over 2023.
Employee engagement 
Eurocommercial prioritises creating a thriving 
workplace environment where employees feel 
valued and motivated. The Company fosters 
fairness, ethics, sustainability, and a healthy lifestyle 
among team members. In 2023, Eurocommercial 
conducted its ﬁrst comprehensive employee

levels. Identiﬁed areas for improvement include 
providing performance feedback, clarifying 
decision-making processes, and enhancing 
communication from management.
Eurocommercial will leverage the survey data 
to pinpoint opportunities for organisational 
improvement, developing tailored action plans at 
both corporate and country levels. The Company 
remains committed to conducting regular 
engagement surveys to monitor progress and 
continuously enhance the employee experience.

Business ethics 
Eurocommercial prioritises clear and transparent 
communication, along with a sense of responsibility, 
reﬂecting our commitment to accountability and 
ethical business practices. Upholding these values 
is essential for fostering enduring relationships with 
tenants, local communities, and governmental 
bodies. Our Code of Conduct serves as the 
cornerstone of our ethical framework, outlining our 
standards and procedures. Ethics training is provided 
to all employees, who regularly review the Code to 
stay abreast of business standards. Any breaches 
of the Code are promptly disclosed to stakeholders, 
ensuring full transparency.
Our Code strictly prohibits bribery and corruption, 
mandating immediate rejection and reporting of any 
such occurrences. Responsibility for upholding the 
Code lies with every employee, overseen by the 
Board of Management. Breaches or fraud incidents 
are to be reported to the Compliance Ofﬁcer or the 
Chairman of the Supervisory Board, ensuring proper 
monitoring and accountability. Eurocommercial 
considers all breaches and frauds as serious matters, 
subject to thorough investigation and disciplinary 
action, including dismissal and prosecution if 
necessary.
In 2023, Eurocommercial reported zero violations 
of the Code, aligning with our commitment to 
maintaining integrity and ethical standards. As part 
of our ongoing efforts, the Code of Conduct will be 
updated in 2024, accompanied by comprehensive 
training to enhance awareness and ensure 
adherence to our ethical policies.
Professional development and alignment of 
interests
Eurocommercial prioritises the professional 
development of its staff through comprehensive 
training initiatives and regular performance 
evaluations. Our employees are encouraged to 
participate in various training programmes, fostering 
continuous learning and skill enhancement. 
Performance reviews are conducted regularly, 
providing valuable feedback and ensuring alignment 
with organisational goals.
As part of our commitment to employee 
development, all personnel undergo yearly 
performance reviews, tracking individual and 
organisational targets established in collaboration

with management. Additionally, employees 
under permanent labour contracts are eligible to 
participate in the Group’s long-term Performance 
Share Plan, aligning remuneration with long-term 
commitment and Company performance.
In 2023, our 97 employees beneﬁtted from an 
average of 20 training hours, underscoring our 
dedication to continuous learning and professional 
development. Furthermore, all employees received 
professional and ESG training, further enhancing 
their skill sets and aligning their interests with the 
Company’s objectives.
Sustainable ofﬁces
Eurocommercial is committed to reducing the 
environmental footprint of its local ofﬁces through 
various sustainability initiatives. Measures have 
been implemented to track and manage business 
travel, community engagement, and energy, water, 
and waste usage across our ofﬁces. Since 2021, a 
Travel Policy has been enforced, aimed at providing 
employees with safety, comfort, and high service 
standards while minimising environmental impact.
The Travel Policy promotes efﬁcient business travel 
and encourages alternatives such as tele- or video-
conferencing whenever feasible. Prioritising bundling 
business trips, and assessing the necessity of travel 
to minimise environmental impact are key objectives. 
In instances where virtual meetings are insufﬁcient 
to achieve business objectives, business trips are 
allowed, but only as a last resort. Eurocommercial 
also offsets all CO² emissions generated from air, 
train, and car travel by purchasing CO² credits from 
projects certiﬁed by the Gold Standard, further 
demonstrating our commitment to environmental 
sustainability.
Sustainable ﬁnance
Eurocommercial has introduced a Green Finance 
Framework to facilitate its transition to a low carbon 
economy and align with its sustainability objectives. 
The framework, subject to review by ISS Corporate 
Solutions, received a Second Party Opinion, 
underscoring its alignment with Eurocommercial’s 
sustainability goals. Both the Green Finance 
Framework and the Second Party Opinion have 
been published on the corporate website. The 
framework serves as a platform for issuing various 
Green Finance Instruments, including loans, bonds, 
and commercial paper, to ﬁnance green projects with 
environmental beneﬁts.
Aligned with international standards such as the 
International Capital Markets Association Green 
Bond Principles and the Loan Market Association 
Green Loan Principles, Eurocommercial’s framework 
also adheres to EU regulations and standards 
like the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the EU 
Green Bond Standard. The Company commits 
to annual reporting on eligible green assets and 
sustainable performance, ensuring transparency and 
accountability.
At the balance sheet date, the Company has entered 
into green and sustainability linked loans for a total 
amount of €602.0 million (€522.8 million group share), 
of which €385.5 million green loans (€306.3 million 
group share), €116.5 million green and sustainability 
linked loans and €100 million sustainability linked 
loans. The Company at 31 December 2023 has 
also entered in sustainability linked swaps for a 
total notional amount of €165 million (of which 
€155 million already efffective at the balance sheet 
date). Eurocommercial aims to further increase the 
number of its green and sustainability linked loans 
and swaps by upgrading them when expiring at 
maturity. The Green Finance Framework and these 
green and sustainability linked facilities form part of 
Eurocommercial’s ambition to increase its exposure 
to green ﬁnancing in the near future.
Environmental, Social and Governance (continued)
In 2023 the Company has made 
significant steps towards the 
achievement of its carbon  
neutrality goals.

data availability for areas under tenant control. This 
improvement was achieved through proactive 
interactions with tenants and energy suppliers to 
facilitate data sharing. Eurocommercial is dedicated 
to bridging the existing data gap in tenant-controlled 
areas. This initiative includes the installation of smart 
meters in tenant spaces and engaging with tenants. 
Such efforts are aimed at enabling Eurocommercial 
to gain a comprehensive understanding of its scope

Eurocommercial provided performance data for all 
indicators. Data is collected for two years Q4 2021–
Q3 2022 vs. Q4 2022–Q3 2023. 
Three assets have been excluded from the like-

has been excluded due to signiﬁcant renovation 
activities undertaken in 2022. Passage du Havre

Etrembières Restaurants, a newly developed 
project adjacent to the Shopping Etrembières, has 
been omitted as it commenced operations in 2023.
Data coverage
Eurocommercial is actively engaging with tenants 
to gather data on their energy consumption (Scope 
3 emissions), aiming to fully comprehend the 
carbon footprint of its portfolio. Incorporating tenant 
consumption data into Eurocommercial Properties’ 
environmental report has required modiﬁcations 
to the tables in this annual report, now distinctly 
separating landlord and tenant energy usage. The

Eurocommercial Properties N.V.
Report of the Board of Management 2023 83
For areas controlled by Eurocommercial, the 
consumption of electricity, fuels, district heating, 
and cooling covers energy acquired by landlords 
for common areas and shared services. In contrast, 
for tenant-controlled areas, the energy—comprising 
electricity, fuels, and district heating and cooling—
is procured either directly by the tenants or by 
Eurocommercial on behalf of tenants who retain 
operational control. Operational control implies that 
tenants have the decision-making power over the 
energy usage and resource management within their 
leased areas. This split is important in the calculation 
of Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.
Whole building
Water data are collected and reported on a whole 
building level basis. Eurocommercial faces challenges 
in achieving complete data coverage for water usage 
(currently 89% coverage), as some tenants in Italy 
and France, having individual water connections, do 
not yet share their consumption information. 
Estimates
The table presented below details the coverage 
of data estimates for each performance indicator 
associated with areas under the management of 
both landlord and tenants. For the reporting year 
2023, no data was estimated.
Data estimates  
Energy Landlord controlled 0%
Energy Tenant controlled 0%
Water Whole building 0%
Waste Whole building 0%
 
Energy
Overall energy consumption of Eurocommercial 
has decreased with 15%, which reﬂects the efforts 
of local teams to lower energy usage as well as the 
implementation of the decarbonisation and energy 
reduction pathways. Electricity consumption of tenant 
areas has increased, this is due to the increased 
data coverage for those tenant areas in Belgium and 
France, not due to higher actual consumptions.
Our corporate ofﬁce in Amsterdam used 61.6 MWh 
electricity, 7 ,128 m³ gas and 217 m³ water in 2023.
Renewable electricity
In alignment with the decarbonisation pathway, 
Eurocommercial has focused on sourcing renewable 
electricity and installing solar panels. Shopping 
Centres Val Thoiry and Etrembières switched their 
electricity contracts to 100% renewable sources 
from 1 January 2023 and Passage du Havre now 
uses renewable electricity for its gallery, not yet for its 
parking area. Additionally, Eurocommercial expanded 
its solar panel installations, leading to a 14% increase 
in on-site renewable electricity generation.
Renewable electricity target
Eurocommercial has set an objective to increase the 
actual level of renewable electricity used, measured 
in % of total electricity, with 2% per annum. 
Eurocommercial controlled electricity consumptions 
within the reporting year (common area electricity 
consumptions) are in scope of this objective. Tenant 
areas are excluded. 
Eurocommercial calculates the proportion of 
electricity consumption from renewable sources 
as a percentage of total electricity consumption 
(non-renewable electricity + renewable electricity 
purchased + renewable electricity self-generated) 
for landlord-controlled common areas and 
shared services. The self-generated electricity 
that is exported or sold (i.e. not consumed by 
Eurocommercial) is excluded.
In 2022 the electricity consumption from renewable 
sources for landlord-controlled areas was 76%, this 
percentage has increased towards 84% in 2023. 
Thus, the target for this reporting year has been 
successfully met.

Prior to 2023, Eurocommercial did not differentiate 
between renewable electricity usage in tenant spaces 
and areas under its own control. Consequently, in 
this year’s report, we are also presenting comparative 
ﬁgures using the methodology from past years.

Carbon emissions
In 2023, total carbon emissions (Scope 1 and 2, 
market-based) showed a reduction of 24%, primarily 
due to a 31% decrease in gas consumption across 
the entire portfolio. This signiﬁcant drop was partly 
because two centres in Italy discontinued using gas 
for heating, while other properties lowered their gas 
usage in response to energy reduction mandates by 
local authorities driven by the energy crisis.
The tables do not include any business travel or 
supply chain emissions. Emissions were calculated 
and reported market-based and location-based. 
Market-based emission factors consider contractual 
arrangements and were provided by local energy 
suppliers.
In 2022, the electricity provider EDF in France 
reported a signiﬁcant rise in its carbon conversion 
factor, attributed to the maintenance of nuclear 
power plants that year. This situation necessitated 
the temporary importation of electricity with a higher 
carbon content from Germany. Therefore market-
based conversion factors that have been used for the 
French portfolio are higher compared to the previous 
year, and even higher than location-based emission 
factors. This results in an increase market-based 
scope 2 emissions in France, which is unusual since 
electricity consumptions have decreased. 
The carbon conversion factors were sourced from 
the following entities:
• UK Government for Company Reporting, 
providing gas conversion factors
• CRREM, for location-based electricity conversion 
Environmental, Social and Governance (continued)
factors in Belgium, Italy, and Sweden
• Base Empreinte ADEME, for location-based 
electricity conversion factors in France
• Local energy providers, for market-based 
conversion factors for electricity and district heating
Emissions were reported using the Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol and EPRA Sustainability Best Practices 
guidelines. Greenhouse gases (GHG) GHG emissions 
are reported as tonnes of CO2 equivalent (t CO2e).
At the Woluwe Shopping Centre, Eurocommercial has 
established a carbon offset programme via contractual 
arrangements with the gas supplier since January 
2022.
Water
Water consumption represents water that is landlord-
obtained and used for common areas and tenants. 
Like-for-like water consumption were stable over the 
two reporting years. Water consumption within the 
Eurocommercial portfolio is obtained via municipal 
supplies.
Waste
Total waste collection saw a 10% increase. It’s 
important to highlight that Eurocommercial is 
enhancing the accuracy of its reported waste data by 
renewing waste contracts. An increasing number of 
third party waste collection companies are nowadays 
able to offer detailed insights into waste collection and 
disposal practices. 
In Sweden, hazardous waste volumes have risen due 
to a 5-year inspection of the oil separator. This process 
involves emptying the oil separator, with the contents 
being treated as hazardous waste. Given that Hallarna 
was formerly a truck stop, it features an exceptionally 
large oil separator, leading to a substantial amount of 
oil-mixed water. 
BREEAM
Eurocommercial has set a goal to achieve BREEAM 
In-Use certiﬁcation for all shopping centres by 2025. 
This target was met for all assets already in the 
previous reporting year. Yet, by the end of 2023, ﬁve 
shopping centres had not been re-certiﬁed due to 
signiﬁcant delays at BRE UK. This objective does not 
apply to Retail Parks.

Energy labels
The energy labels for properties in France and Italy 
have been updated, reﬂecting the positive impact 
of the implemented energy-saving measures. This 
has led to enhanced energy labels for Centr’Azur, 
Les Portes de Taverny, MoDo, Fiordaliso, and I Gigli. 
However, for Shopping Centre Woluwe in Belgium, 
obtaining an energy label is currently not possible, 
hence it lacks an energy label.
Intensity calculations
Energy intensity metrics for buildings are derived from 
the total energy consumption across both landlord 
and tenant spaces, factoring in the respective ﬂoor 
areas.
In the reporting year 2023, the collection of additional 
energy consumption data from tenant spaces 
inﬂuenced the ﬂoor area calculations (denominators) 
used for intensity metrics. As a result, energy 
intensities saw an 8% decrease, alongside a notable 
27% reduction in carbon intensities (Scope 1, 2, and 
3). Water intensity levels remained consistent across 
the two reporting periods.
Eurocommercial recognises, following the 
European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA) 
Sustainability Best Practices Recommendations, 
that discrepancies between the energy consumed 
(numerator) and the ﬂoor area (denominator) may still 
impact the accuracy of intensity calculations.
Restatements
Restatements on previous reporting years have been 
made for assets when improved data or insight was 
available.
In last year’s report Eurocommercial mentioned 
a share of electricity purchased by renewable 
resources of 85% versus 72% in 2021. For two of 
our French properties, the renewal of green electricity 
contracts did not occur as anticipated, leading to 
a lack of renewable electricity procurement since 
January 2022. This caused an overestimation 
of renewable electricity procurement in 2022. 
Furthermore, at Woluwe Shopping, an error resulted 
in the double-counting of on-site generated solar 
energy in our renewable energy ﬁgures. The actual 
share of renewable electricity in 2022 should have 
been 83%. 
The veriﬁcation of waste data has revealed 
inconsistencies in the reported waste ﬁgures for two 
Italian shopping centres, primarily affecting the total 
volume of waste send to landﬁll.
Water submetering has offered greater clarity on 
Eurocommercial’s share of water usage at MoDo 
shopping centre, where Eurocommercial is a co-
owner. Adjustments have been applied to the data for 
the previous reporting year to improve transparency 
and enable more accurate comparisons between the 
two reporting periods.
Eurocommercial is addressing these issues by 
reviewing and improving its reporting processes to 
ensure the accuracy in its environmental data. The 
Company is committed to maintaining transparency 
and meeting high standards in its environmental 
reporting. Amendments were made, where 
necessary for both reporting years, to provide 
clarity and enhance comparability between the two 
reporting periods. 
Third party assurance
The reported energy, water, and waste consumptions 
as well as scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions are third party 
veriﬁed by Lucideon CICS for the 2023 reporting 
period, using ISO 14064-3 (the international standard 
for veriﬁcation of greenhouse gas inventories). More 
information is available as part of our annual CDP 
submission.

Organisational boundaries, reporting period and coverage
All employees who work directly for Eurocommercial in The 
Netherlands, United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy, France and Belgium 
were included in these ﬁgures. Eurocommercial provided performance 
data for the calendar years 2022 and 2023 for all social and 
governance indicators. 
Health and Safety assessments
These assessments are a review of health and safety impacts on asset 
level for compliance or improvement. For the shopping centres Health 
& Safety is integrated into the BREEAM certiﬁcation procedure. 
 
 
Gender pay ratio 
The gender pay ratio as reported in the table is the ratio of the 
base salary and remuneration of men to women in the mentioned 
employee categories. Base salary represents the salary excluding 
additional remuneration such as bonuses, share options or overtime 
pay. Please note that Eurocommercial only employed 97 persons 
at the end of 2023, and therefore, it is not possible to disclose more 
detailed information on gender pay ratio, due to the limited number 
of employees with the same function and experience within the 
organisation.
Narrative on performance 
Employee turnover rates have decreased compared to 2022 and 
absentee rates have increased slightly. Other main social indicators 
have remained consistent over both reporting periods.
