Broad cooperation  
to tackle congestion
In several regions in the Netherlands, 
the limits of maximum grid capacity 
were reached due to the acceleration 
of the energy transition as a result of 
global energy developments. TenneT is 
preparing congestion management to 
create additional capacity. In addition, 
a National Taskforce Grid Congestion 
delivered an action programme.
Flevoland outage
A short circuit incident in a high-
voltage substation in Flevoland had 
a major impact on the surrounding 
area. This led to a power outage and 
a lot of inconvenience in the region, 
including the months-long failure of 
a train connection.
Connections of  
1,400 MW ready to use 
In the Netherlands, TenneT's high-
voltage offshore grid connections for 
the offshore wind farms Hollandse 
Kust (south) Alpha and Beta, are ready 
for use.
North Sea powerhouse 
In May's Esbjerg Declaration, 
Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark 
and Belgium agreed to jointly install at 
least 65 GW of offshore wind power 
by 2030. TenneT will realise almost 
two-thirds of this.
Grid expansion  
Wahle - Mecklar
In September Lower Saxony's 
Energy Minister Olaf Lies (SPD) 
and TenneT officially commissioned 
the first two of four sections of 
our largest 380 kV grid expansion 
Wahle - Mecklar in Lamspringe.

Letter from the Board
Our Integrated Annual Report 2022 comes on the eve of a new and challenging era 
for TenneT now that TenneT and its shareholder, the Dutch state, are engaged in discussions 
with the German government to explore the possibility of a full sale of TenneT’s German 
activities on acceptable terms. Such a transaction would enable the creation of two strong 
national players who would continue to cooperate in driving the energy transition on land and 
leading offshore transmission. TenneT's focus in the discussions will be on ensuring security 
of supply and safeguarding the interests of its employees, customers, suppliers, financiers 
and other stakeholders.
 
As this IAR reflects the year 2022 it reports on the activities 
of one integrated TenneT.
Over the past year, both the short and long-term challenges 
facing the energy system forced us to perform like a sprinter 
and marathon runner at the same time. More than ever, we 
are responsible for enabling a carbon-free energy system 
several decades from now, while in the short term our grids 
need to maintain security of supply on a highly volatile 
energy market. In 2022, together with other European TSOs 
and governments, we kept the electricity supply secure  
 
during the energy crisis. Our high voltage grids showed 
a 99.9996% availability. This made them indispensable 
for society and they remained a strong foundation for 
our economy.
Alongside our solid grid availability, TenneT in 2022 
remained committed to the design, maintenance and 
operation of the high-voltage grids. For example, we 
introduced a new generation of grid connection systems, 
the so-called 2GW offshore programme, which sets a new 
standard in the industry and will allow the entire offshore

chain for wind energy to benefit from more than double the 
capacity of existing grid connection systems in an 
environmentally friendly manner. We realised two new 
offshore grid connection systems for wind energy with a 
total capacity of 1,400 MW, Hollandse Kust Zuid alpha and 
beta. And we completed the topside installation of DolWin6 
(900 MW) and Hollandse Kust Noord (700 MW). These latter 
two projects are planned to go in service in 2023. On land, 
TenneT delivered 320 kilometres of new high-voltage power 
lines and 6 new high voltage substations. Furthermore, we 
strongly scaled up our maintenance activities by, among 
other things, replacing and modernising dozens of high-
voltage substations. We are also pleased that, together 
with the 38 European TSOs, we were able to support the 
Ukrainian electricity system by synchronising both the 
Ukrainian and Moldovan high-voltage grids with the 
European system. Due to the still volatile situation in energy 
markets, this year's annual analyses in Germany and the 
Netherlands to assess the readiness to secure electricity 
supply for the winter period were performed with extra 
intensity. On behalf of the German Federal Ministry for 
Economic Affairs and Climate Action, TenneT - together 
with the three other German TSOs – conducted a special 
analysis on the security of supply of the power grids, the  
so-called ‘stress test’. The TSOs put forward a number of 
proposals aimed at ensuring security of electricity supply. 
These proposals were adopted and implemented by the 
German government. In the Netherlands the analysis 
showed a reassuring picture in terms of security of 
electricity supply.
Safety needs our energy
Despite our endeavours to always ensure highest 
standards of safety, we were deeply saddened in 2022 by 
the fatalities of a TenneT colleague and an employee of 
one of our contractors, while they were working on 
construction projects in Germany. We sympathise deeply 
with the bereaved families and are more determined than 
ever to put even more emphasis on life saving rules and 
zero harm practices, to ensure the safest possible working 
environment. We started Safety Tops, dialogues with the 
top management of all our (sub)contractors to look together 
at how to ensure safety on all our projects and for all our 
people and partners. Zero Harm, in addition to all 
processes and measures, is a mindset that must be daily 
lived by top management all the way to the people in the 
field and back again.
Shaping the climate-neutral grid together
Our growth path comes with great responsibilities and 
tough choices. The war in Ukraine has made it clear 
that business and communities need to become more 
independent from fossil fuels and to accelerate the energy 
transition. As demand shifts away from fossil fuels, 
electrification in the transport, building and industrial sectors 
could cut greenhouse gas emissions in the EU significantly 
by 2050. TenneT takes its responsibility to support this 
transition and has developed the so-called Target Grid 2045 
to steer the future infrastructure expansion by anticipating 
sensing political developments and needs. 
The Target Grid 2045 provides a realistic vision of the 
high-voltage grid on land and offshore, with power corridors 
connecting countries around us. Based on a back-casting 
approach, it allows early alignment among all stakeholders 
on goals and is based on relevant national infrastructure 
plans. With the goal of providing a fully sustainable energy 
system, we aim to deliver a future-proof, reliable and 
cost-efficient grid, ready on time.
Offshore wind energy leads the green way
The Target Grid 2045 is underlined by challenging targets 
for offshore wind development. For TenneT, it will be crucial 
to succeed in connecting 40 GW of offshore wind in the 
Netherlands and Germany by 2030. This is from a total 
of 65 GW committed to the Esbjerg Declaration, the first 
intergovernmental agreement between Belgium, Denmark, 
Germany and the Netherlands envisaging up to 150 GW 
of offshore wind to be built until 2050.
These objectives not only require political determination, 
but also important energy system innovations. We have 
developed a world-first with our proprietary 2GW direct 
current (DC) standard for offshore connection systems, 
allowing larger wind farms to be connected to the grid with 
fewer platforms and cables. Also, our 2GW offshore 
converter platforms are ‘hub-ready’. This means that they 
can be connected to a future DC grid. To truly make the 
North Sea a green powerhouse for Europe, TenneT is 
exploring options for energy hubs at sea. These will not only 
connect wind farms to onshore grids, but also serve as 
connections between North Sea countries. In time, these 
North Sea power hubs will also enable large-scale 
conversion of wind energy to green hydrogen.

Challenges on the path ahead
Over the last year the Netherlands has seen a boom in 
business grid connection requests, adding to a total 
capacity of 40 GW. This is more than three times the 
capacity needed for electricity consumption of the whole 
of the Netherlands on a normal day. However, our grid 
capacity cannot be expanded at the same pace to meet 
sudden demand at this scale. We therefore paused issuing 
new connection requests for companies in some parts of 
the Netherlands. To accommodate different stakeholder 
interests, we initiated a national consultation process 
looking for more flexibility in the electricity demand of 
industry to facilitate new requests from customers. Under 
the auspices of the Minister of Economic Affairs and 
Climate, the National Grid Congestion Action Program 
was launched to create more space o the electricity grid 
in every possible manner. 
As the electrification of industry advances, we call for 
more clarity on the transition plans of industrial end-users, 
allowing the switch to electricity to be better orchestrated 
in a non-discriminatory manner. In doing so, we advocate a 
smart location policy, in which industry requiring large-scale 
electricity consumption should preferably locate as close as 
possible to renewable generation, for example where 
offshore wind energy is connected to land. This avoids 
unnecessary additional infrastructure that would be 
necessary to provide electricity to energy-intensive 
consumers such as electrolysis plants, just like making use 
of the so-called emergency lane in our grids to connect 
additional solar and wind farms.
In an effort to shorten lengthy permit procedures, the Dutch 
and German governments have recognised that current 
permitting practices delay the energy transition. However, 
in the Netherlands we also expect the ban on nitrogen 
emissions to negatively impact the progress of our projects. 
In Germany, we welcome efforts to relieve delays such as 
simplification of legislation which would allow us to start 
construction of projects earlier.
As many companies and institutions, we are facing a tight 
labour market, particularly for highly skilled technical staff. 
The energy transition must move faster, so we need all 
hands on deck and bring. We need all talent to the table: 
men and women, from the countries in which we operate as 
well as culturally rich, highly educated and practically skilled 
international people. Therefore, diversity is not a KPI for us 
but the essence of our business. We like to work together 
with other companies, the government and knowledge 
institutes to find, motivate, bind and grow all talents for a job 
in the energy transition. To address this, TenneT is 
partnering with universities and secondary vocational 
education institutions to bring in talented people and to 
partly train them internally. We also focus on specific target 
groups such as IT professionals with tailor-made campaigns.
European co-operation gets us closer to our 
goals faster
As the energy transition can only succeed if tackled at 
European level, it is important for TenneT to engage in 
intensive international co-operation. This will ensure the 
functioning of integrated electricity markets which are key 
for a resilient electricity supply, especially during the winter. 
In the North Sea, we are a strong partner to realise its 
potential as a renewable power hub for Europe. To this end, 
we are developing an international agreement on technical 
standards and conditions, with laws and regulations and a 
well-functioning market model. As a leading cross-border 
grid operator, TenneT is closely involved in this joint effort, 
and will further expand its role as a reliable and independent 
advisor to governments.
Through intensified co-operation with our suppliers TenneT 
is helping to create an environment where market players 
can invest more securely, employ people with greater 
certainty and secure available resources in supply chains. 
We did this in 2022 by developing two large-scale EU 
tenders for long-term framework contracts for the 
development of the 2GW offshore connection systems. 
Such agreements create more certainty in the market for 
the required scale-up, giving the offshore industry the 
investment security it needs.
Financial health is essential to complete 
our journey
Our investments amounted to as much as EUR 4.5 billion 
in 2022. And investments will rise in the next ten years. 
As political ambitions evolve, we aim to deliver at least 
EUR 8 billion annually in projects. This is fully in line with the 
national energy policies of Germany and the Netherlands 
and largely attributable to the energy transition. In 2022 
TenneT issued two Green Bonds totalling EUR 6.85 billion. 
With these offerings, TenneT strengthened its status as the 
largest corporate EUR green debt issuer globally, with 
currently approximately EUR 19.5 billion of green debt 
outstanding across different formats (senior, hybrid, 
USPP and Schuldscheine) issued        in the last 7 years. It 
also shows the company’s favourable access to capital 
markets. To safeguard our financial health, we strive for a 
good balance between debt and equity allowing us to 
finance our projects as reliably and efficiently as possible. 
The Dutch state has given its commitment to shoulder the 
equity requirement for the Dutch part of our investment

portfolio, currently estimated at EUR 10 billion. For our 
German investment portfolio, the equity requirement is 
approximately EUR 15 billion.
We look forward to further exploration and negotiation with 
the German state in cooperation with the Dutch state while 
moving ‘full steam ahead’ given the challenges and 
opportunities resulting from the energy transition. We, the 
Executive Board of TenneT, are personally committed to the 
European energy transition and to deliver on our promises. 
We also commit to lead this process and stay on board to 
create two national champions together with all our people 
and together with both governments to achieve the climate 
goals 2030 and beyond.
A wholehearted thank you!
We are incredibly grateful to our colleagues and partners, 
for their commitment to accelerate the energy transition in 
the Netherlands and Germany and for all the extra effort to 
help our colleagues in and the people of Ukraine. We thank 
all our colleagues wholeheartedly for their tireless efforts, 
resilience and commitment during a challenging and rather 
unthinkably impactful year 2022.
Looking ahead, we all trust to work together closely and 
with a shared focus towards the goal of a sustainable, 
reliable and affordable energy system for all. We are fully 
aware this will take perseverance. And by working together 
with all our stakeholders, we will build this new, meshed grid 
on land and offshore fit for the future. With a steady beat of 
endurance and determination we are changing the very 
heart of European energy. We are on it!
On behalf of TenneT's Executive Board, 
Manon van Beek (CEO)

About
TenneT
With over 25,000 kilometres of high-voltage connections both onshore and offshore, 
our role as Transmission System Operator is to ensure a secure supply of electricity to 
nearly 43 million end-users, in the Netherlands and a large part of Germany, and to create 
the infrastructure to be able to secure supply today and tomorrow.
Our core tasks
Our primary tasks are to provide power transmission 
services, system services and facilitation of the energy 
market. These tasks follow from our appointment as grid 
operator under the Dutch and German energy laws, 
the ‘Elektriciteitswet’ (E-wet) and the German 
‘Energiewirtschaftsgesetz’ (EnWG). 
Transmitting electricity
Power transmission services mean that our role is to 
transmit electricity via our electricity grid. This is the 
backbone of the electricity supply system. We transmit 
electricity from where it is generated by other parties, either 
on land or at sea or imported from other markets. Electricity 
is transmitted to our customers via our high voltage grid, 
being 110 kV and higher in the Netherlands and 220 kV 
and higher in a large part of Germany. As electricity is 
often generated far away from where it is used, we need 
to transmit it over large distances without incurring major 
losses on the way. To achieve this, we transmit electricity 
at very high voltages. 
System services
System services refers to our role in carefully managing the 
balance between the supply and demand of electricity and 
to keep the frequency at a constant level (50 hertz). 
To do this, we have control centres in the Netherlands and 
in Germany, where supply and demand are monitored and 
controlled 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Market facilitation
In addition, we ensure that European electricity markets 
are set up in an efficient manner so we are able to create a 
(single) market where consumers can rely on security of 
supply at an affordable price. To this end, we build and 
operate for instance interconnections (such as NorNed, 
NordLink, BritNed and the COBRAcable), to create 
possibilities to import and export electricity. We also work 
together with other European TSOs and electricity markets 
to guarantee the reliability of the supply of electricity and to 
balance supply and demand across borders and markets. 
Driving the energy transition
The future energy system will become increasingly 
dependent on renewable sources. But renewables are, 
by nature, intermittent – the sun does not always shine 
and the wind does not always blow. This calls for a change 
in the system, for example through new developments such 
as storage and demand side response are also new 
developments. TenneT is working on these challenges 
together with its stakeholders. We build grids that integrate 
new energy sources and unlock flexibility, both onshore and

Our role in Europe
By 2050, Europe aims to become the first climate neutral 
continent. TenneT’s service areas in the Netherlands and 
Germany, alongside European governments are key to 
making this ambition a reality. In the transition to a climate 
neutral continent, the energy transition is an important 
element to make sure that society has a sustainable supply 
of energy. Governments in the areas we serve have 
formulated ambitions to support Europe’s climate targets, 
with the German government aiming for climate neutrality 
in 2045 and the Dutch government in 2050. 
As a key player in the energy sector, TenneT aims to help 
shape this future energy landscape. As a cross border TSO, 
we strive to share our insights to integrate and switch to 
more renewable energy sources to power society, whilst 
aiming to ensure that we are able to keep the lights on at all 
times. We do this by working together with stakeholders in 
developing new concepts and sharing these with the 
governments in the areas we serve. In doing so, we help 
meet Europe’s ambition to become the first climate neutral 
continent and contribute to the Paris Agreement and the 
national agreements which support it. 
In order to meet Europe’s 2050 ambition, offshore wind 
has an important role. This year, the leaders of the European 
Commission, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands and 
Germany pledged to expand the combined North Sea 
offshore-wind capacity of the four countries to 65 GW by 
2030. Of this, TenneT will be responsible for connecting 
around 40 GW to the onshore grid. Next to this, we are 
making sure that renewable energy can be integrated into 
the grid properly, for example by investments into the 
backbone of our electricity grid. 
TenneT is one of Europe’s largest investors in national and 
cross-border electricity transmission capacity on land and 
at sea, bringing together the Northwest European energy 
markets and efficiently unlocking large-scale renewable 
electricity sources. We collaborate with a wide range of 
partners in the energy market to develop and apply new, 
smart technologies and contribute to integration of the 
energy transition in the future.
To be able to deliver a greener future energy system, 
we are working on system integration, such as the further 
development of green hydrogen. Here, the combined 
knowledge and technologies of the electricity and gas 
industry come together to find an integrated solution for 
the energy transition. 
Key developments in the environment we operate in
The urgency and complexity of tackling climate change 
means that TenneT operates within a challenging context 
that is continuously developing. With respect to various time 
frames, we see the following developments that affect us.
Scarcity of resources
A key development and challenge we foresee as we drive 
the energy transition is the availability of key resources such 
as raw materials, manufactured components and people. 
In the short term, scarcity of resources can occur due to 
challenges in the supply chain, for example due to the 
recent pandemic or the war in Ukraine. In the longer term, 
an increased demand related to the energy transition could 
lead to a shortage of critical materials, most notably 
aluminium, copper and steel, as well as manufactured 
products, such as components for HVDC (high-voltage 
direct current) systems. There are even some expectations 
that at the end of this decade, the supply of scarce 
resources is not able to meet demand. That is why we are 
working at TenneT to further integrate principles of circularity 
into our work practices. More information on this is included 
in our chapter ‘Create value to transition to a climate neutral 
economy’. 
However, it is not just materials that are becoming scarcer: 
we see the same trend with respect to human capital. 
Difficulties in the labour market are visible in many more 
sectors in the recent years. A shortage of technical staff has 
been visible for a longer time and could have an impact on 
TenneT, especially considering an ageing population. How 
we address this, can be found in the ‘Create a safe and 
inspiring workplace’ chapter.
Higher costs of materials and energy
The economies in the areas we serve and the markets 
where we procure our goods and services have been 
affected by rising costs of resources. These rising costs 
of goods and services have a significant effect on the cost 
of our investment projects. The price of energy in the EU 
reached record levels in 2022. This rise, linked to the 
increase of wholesale energy prices globally, started back in 
2021 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and growing 
international demand. On the wholesale electricity market, 
there was a reduction in available power supplies compared

to 2021 which, combined with higher gas prices, has 
caused an increase in the electricity price. Besides the 
war in Ukraine, a dryer summer in 2022 also had an impact 
on the system costs we incurred to balance the grid and 
secure electricity supply. 
Climate change and the energy transition
One of the most urgent and complex societal challenges 
of our times is climate change, of which we have seen the 
effects more drastically in the last decennium. The UN 
Climate Change Conference, COP27, emphasised once 
again the urgent need for mitigating climate change. This 
will affect the energy sector, including TenneT, in every 
aspect and we consider its (potential) impacts with the 
decisions we take. Due to changing weather and climate 
patterns, such as storms, floods and droughts, our 
transmission system needs to be more resilient to a variety 
of different external circumstances. At the same time, to 
mitigate the most adverse impacts of climate change, 
governments are stepping up their climate ambitions to 
build a net-zero economy by 2050. To accommodate this, 
we are redesigning the current energy system and how we 
operate it, planning ahead and building a future-proof 
energy system. Through our knowledge and experience of 
the energy system, TenneT serves as a thought leader in 
the energy transition and drives it forward.
Energy crisis
The war in Ukraine and the resulting energy crisis has 
impacted the world and the energy sector in particular. 
It stressed the importance of reducing geopolitical 
dependency on a single energy source, and highlighted 
the need for a diverse, sustainable and affordable energy 
supply in the long term. TenneT worked hard to ensure that 
security of supply was not affected by energy shortages in 
2022, for example by scenario planning and co-operating 
with national governments and other TSOs. The energy 
crisis also affected TenneT through rising energy prices. 
Higher energy prices have an effect on the costs of ancillary 
services such as redispatch (as we compensate producers 
of electricity for curtailed generation or infeed) and grid 
losses. Moreover, the energy crisis has led to a price surge 
for resources and goods in general and was one of the root 
causes for rising inflation.

Our strategy 
To be able to deliver on our purpose - to connect everyone 
with a brighter energy future - we are guided by the TenneT 
strategy. This is focused on ensuring we are able to secure 
supply of electricity today and tomorrow by preparing our 
grid for a future and climate-neutral energy system, which 
we call our Target Grid. Our strategy helps us realise the 
access to clean and affordable energy for society, thereby 
contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals (in 
particular SDG 7, 9 and 13).
Our strategy steers to deliver on our purpose and create 
value for society. Also, in our decisions, we consider the 
three elements of ‘the balancing act’, as we aim to weigh in

on the effect on reliability, sustainability and affordability in 
this respect. Through our four strategic pillars, we 
distinguish our four main ambition areas and we have set 
specific targets for our first important milestone (2025) on 
the road towards a net-zero energy system. Secure supply 
today and tomorrow and Drive the energy transition explain 
how we turn our core tasks into strategic actions. Energise 
our people and organisation is critical as our employees are 
our most important asset and help us deliver on our tasks 
every day. Finally, Safeguard our financial health is important 
not only to guarantee financing for our extensive investment 
portfolio, but also in our responsibility to consider the 
affordability of our decisions.
Our principles and balancing act
Our purpose 
To connect everyone with  
a brighter energy future 
Our promise 
Lighting the way ahead together
 
 
Our principles
The TenneT principles provide guidance to how we aim to 
create societal value:
• Ownership. We are accountable for our words, actions 
and decisions.
• Connection. The energy transition is a challenge that 
requires new ideas, new technologies and new 
behaviours that build on the strong foundations we have 
laid. It also requires co-operation on all different levels as 
we do not have all the answers ourselves. This is why we 
work actively with other parties.
• Courage. We are honest, open and clear about what we 
think. We dare to make bold decisions, take ambitious 
initiatives and are willing to learn from our mistakes.
Balancing our decisions
At TenneT we are responsible for balancing the electricity 
grid: to keep the grid frequency of exactly 50 hertz at all 
times, electricity demand and consumption need to be in 
balance. This requires the constant and delicate planning 
and balancing of the transmission needs. However, we are 
also guided by another balancing act. To design and build 
the future electricity system, we do not only consider 
reliability (security of supply) but also the sustainability and 
affordability of this system. We believe that all these three 
elements are necessary when planning for a future energy 
system that meets societal needs. As we have to carefully 
balance these three elements in all the decisions we take, 
we refer to this as ‘the balancing act’. 
An example of the balancing act is when we are planning 
and designing new projects to expand or reinforce the 
electricity grid to ensure a secure supply of electricity not 
only now, but also in the future. We make use of raw 
materials such as copper and mineral oil, as these are 
critical to the well-functioning of our assets and as such, 
the reliability of our grid. As these are also naturally scarce 
resources that come with a negative environmental impact, 
we aim to increase circular use of these products. We aim 
to make more sustainable choices by looking for 
alternatives, such as aluminium instead of copper. The 
qualities of resources differ, which does not make it clear 
cut to switch materials. And at the same time, we also take 
into account the costs associated with these choices, 
whereas a choice that benefits reliability or sustainability 
might also come with a cost. We strive to find the right 
balance between all three elements. 
Our path towards 2050
By 2050 the European Union aims to become a climate-
neutral continent and by 2030 the EU already demands 
55% lower emissions. These ambitions have been 
translated to national policies as realising an energy system 
that fits this ambition is an important factor. Together with 
partners within and outside the energy sector, including 
other TSOs, regional DSOs and national governments, 
TenneT is committed to deliver a future-proof energy 
system. These milestone dates may seem far away, but for 
TenneT 2030 is already tomorrow. This is one of the reasons 
why we are developing our approach regarding a Target 
Grid. With this, we want to connect to plans for national grid 
development and provide input to accelerate them. Our 
goal is to build a future-proof, reliable, energy- and cost-
efficient power grid in time, to meet political climate targets.

Our approach is to prepare ourselves up to 2025, by when 
we will be at a capacity to meet peak delivery. By 2030, we 
will ensure that the Target Grid is prepared, which will result 
in having a reliable electricity grid backbone in place that 
can support the increasing electrification by industry and 
end-users. Projects are built to be future-proof, which 
means that we account for extra capacity ahead of time. Up 
to 2045, we will build the Target Grid and make sure that all 
sectors of the energy system are coupled, with the North 
Sea established as the new powerhouse of Europe. By this 
date, we aim to have realised an integrated onshore and 
offshore grid that is carbon free.
How will we make Target Grid 2045 happen?
• Back casting as a license to plan: We begin with a 2045 
fossil-free scenario and plan backwards. This additional 
dimension of working can help us make our investments 
future proof and even go a step further, for example by 
preparing future infrastructure way ahead of time. 
• Build future-proof: When building new infrastructure, we 
build in a way that is future-proof. If the Target Grid 
shows that in the future more power is for a station or 
line, we prepare for that.
• Plan for more, build what is needed: By preparing for a 
high electricity scenario, we are ready for scenarios with 
less electrification by building only what is needed: no 
money is wasted.
• Stakeholder engagement: Working even more closely 
with contractors and suppliers to build the network of the 
future is key. We must involve stakeholders in developing 
robust scenarios and involve in the implementation. 
The Target Grid cannot be realised without collaboration: 
to reach each milestone, everyone has a role to play. 
How we create value
TenneT plays an important role within the electricity supply 
chain and helps enable the lives of people working and 
living in the areas we serve. The way we create value is 
represented visually on the next pages, using the concept 
of value creation as described by the International 
Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), which together with the 
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) formed 
the Value Reporting Foundation. By means of the six 
capitals defined by this framework (financial, manufactured, 
intellectual, human, social & relationship and natural) we 
describe our input, output, outcome and impact. This 
model is the basis of our Integrated Annual Report. Our 
inputs, through which we create impact for society, are 
influenced by our strategy, our purpose and our principles. 
All of these are described in this chapter. Moreover, while 
conducting our core activities as a TSO our decisions are 
always influenced by the balancing act of reliability, 
affordability and sustainability. More information on the 
specific inputs, our related outputs, outcomes and impacts 
are disclosed in the sections ‘Our performance in 2022’ in 
each of the respective chapters. The way we aim to create 
long-term value is defined alongside the six outputs from 
our value creation model. Here we aim to:
Deliver a high security of supply
Our core task is to secure the supply of electricity, today 
and tomorrow. And with this, we support the daily lives and 
activities of people and businesses in the areas we serve. In 
today’s fast changing and more volatile energy system, 
securing supply is increasingly challenging. TenneT aims to 
create value to society through its decades of experience in 
operating our grid, together with a vision of how the future 
grid and electricity markets should be designed. 
Ensure critical infrastructure for society
Electricity plays a vital role in the lives of our stakeholders 
and society as a whole. TenneT builds and maintains the 
high-voltage onshore and offshore grid that is needed for 
this secure supply of electricity. With the materials and 
products we use to build and maintain our grid, such as our 
cables, substations, pylons and interconnectors, we realise 
the critical infrastructure that supports today’s electricity 
needs as well as enabling the energy system of the future.

Create a safe and inspiring workplace
We consider our employees to be our most important asset 
as they enable us to deliver on our strategic ambitions and 
create value for society. To this end, we aim to offer a safe, 
sustainable and inclusive place to work for all employees. 
Our programmes and actions focus on creating an inclusive 
and energising environment where people can thrive. 
Create value to transition to a climate neutral 
economy
As a company at the centre of the energy sector, we want 
to drive the energy transition and contribute to achieving the 
climate targets of the Netherlands, Germany and the 
European Union. We do this by contributing to a sustainable 
energy system, where we are able to connect everyone in 
our service area to green electricity. Simultaneously, we 
strive to reduce the environmental impact of our operations. 
This is related to our carbon emissions, our impact on the 
natural environment and the materials we need to build, 
operate and maintain our grid. 
Safeguard sustainable financial performance and 
investor ratings
In order to create long-term value, we are focused 
on maintaining our financial health. Our main sources of 
financing are our regulatory revenue and externally raised 
capital, which increasingly stems from green financing. 
To safeguard our financial health, we aim to optimise our 
financing costs and deliver a return on capital that meets 
the expectations of our capital providers. In addition it is 
essential to maintain strong credit and ESG ratings.
Solve societal challenges with stakeholders and 
through partnerships
We are convinced that collaboration with stakeholders and 
strong partnerships with suppliers, customers and other 
parties are essential to building the future energy system 
and securing supply today and tomorrow. By combining 
experience and knowledge from different organisations 
within and outside the energy sector, we achieve our 
strategic objectives.
More information can be found in the section ‘Sustainable 
Development Goals and TenneT’ and in the chapters 
‘Deliver a high security of supply’, ‘Create value to transition 
to a climate neutral economy’ and ‘Safeguard sustainable 
financial performance and investor ratings’.
How we create and measure societal impact
The combination of these outputs also enables us to create 
outcomes and make societal impact. Our aim is to reduce 
our negative and increase our positive outputs, outcomes 
and impact, such as reducing our own carbon footprint and 
help to increase avoided emissions by connecting more and 
more renewable energy sources to our grid. With the role 
and scale we have as a company, we are aware that we are 
able to create these societal impacts, both negative and 
positive. We believe that these impacts are not the result of 
one output or capital and therefore choose to connect them 
to all and to the sustainable development goals we 
contribute the most to. We feel that these are our most 
material societal impacts to report on. 
Disclosing an organisation’s impact(s) is a relatively new 
area of reporting. Measuring these impacts is therefore a 
journey and we continue to refine our methodology on this 
along the road. These insights help us to see to which 
extent we are meeting some of our strategic goals and even 
enables us to see to which extent we are able to fulfill our 
purpose as reporting on the equivalent number of 
households that in theory would have been able to receive 
100% green electricity provides us with information to which 
extent we are able to connect everyone with a brighter 
energy future. 
Our aim is to disclose the outcomes and impacts which we 
create on a societal level as a European TSO. This provides 
insights from a broader perspective on how the people 
living in the areas we serve experience the positive or 
negative impact we create and have on them. By focussing 
on these impacts we believe that we provide more 
meaningful insights for stakeholders rather than to focus 
on translating a variety of our company level outputs to 
outcomes and impacts.

Our supply chain
Our main task is to secure supply of electricity to 
nearly 43 million people in the areas we serve. To realise 
this, we transmit electricity via our high-voltage grid. To 
do this effectively today and tomorrow, we need to build, 
maintain and operate our grid. These dimensions have 
their own challenges and opportunities.
Electricity is either imported from other areas of the 
European grid or generated from conventional or renewable 
sources which are connected to our grid. This can be 
conventional power sources such as a coal-fired plant, 
or renewables such as from solar or wind and gas, which 
has been recognised for its role as a transition fuel in 
decarbonisation. In order to support the transition towards 
a decarbonised energy system, careful planning is required 
to integrate more renewable energy sources into our grid 
and to be able to secure supply of electricity at all times. 
When electricity is transmitted to our grid, we ensure that 
this is transmitted to our customers, being either large 
industries, the Distribution System Operators (DSOs) or 
being exported to other areas of the European grid. 
The hard work of many of our colleagues ensures this is 
possible. Our people do this by ensuring that we operate 
the grid well, by balancing supply and demand of electricity, 
facilitating the markets and with that ensure we are able to 
operate the grid in the best and most efficient way.
But also, we need to build and maintain a high quality, 
reliable, sustainable, and resilient grid that can support the 
energy system of the future. This requires the development 
of new technologies and causes an increase in demand 
for proven technology and skilled resources, next to raw 
materials, such as steel, copper and aluminium, which are 
manufactured or mined by third parties and used in our 
projects to build and maintain our assets. These assets are 
crucial to operate our grid. The use of these raw materials 
has a high environmental impact, with respect to the 
extraction and processing of these materials. Another high 
impact regarding these raw materials, like copper, relates to 
the fact that these resources, whose availability is critical to 
the energy transition, are becoming much more scarce. We 
want to be a green and responsible grid operator, taking 
measures to reduce our negative impacts and even creating 
positive impacts, wherever possible.
This means that in designing new parts of our grid, we need 
to consider different variables that support a greener and 
more sustainable energy landscape. This relates to 
scenarios which are more beneficial to our planet, such as 
enhanced circularity, biodiversity and working together with 
our partners to promote sustainable choices in the 
production and realisation of our assets. At the same time, 
we want to ensure that we help them do this in a way that 
meets our view on sustainable business conduct, such 
as in the area of human rights, including a safe working 
environment. This also applies when construction or 
maintenance works are executed. When our assets reach 
the end of their lifecycle, we aim to reuse and recycle all 
materials or components where possible.
Working together with our partners in the supply chain
The developments described earlier in this chapter underpin 
the importance of working together with partners in our 
supply chain to overcome these challenges together and to 
realise the ambitious investment portfolio TenneT has. This 
way, both TenneT and its contractors are able to grow jointly 
and meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.
A strong relationship with our contractors is therefore of 
utmost importance, as they bring valuable expertise and 
capacity to help drive the energy transition. That is why 
at TenneT we are working for several years now with an 
integrated approach on Supply Chain Management. This 
programme helps us to mitigate the risks of increasing 
scarcity of materials and services, the price increases of 
raw materials and the unpredictability of global logistics. 
The goal of this programme is to build partnerships with 
our most important suppliers based on trust, transparency, 
and mutual respect. Understanding each other’s interests, 
wanting to learn from each other, to improve operations 
and to jointly work on improvement projects, all on the basis 
of equality. This should result in increasing the reliability of 
our supply chains, efficient co-operation and a good safety 
performance.

Examples of this include our so-called EU 303 related to 
substations in the Netherlands and EU 300 contracts 
regarding technical and spatial services, of which the latter 
was awarded in September 2022. Important part of these 
EU 30X contracts is that our suppliers gain better insights 
into forecasts regarding future projects. Furthermore, we will 
work with global partners on a long-term framework 
contract for our innovate 2GW offshore program to ensure 
that our acceleration in the energy transition is being met 
through renewable offshore wind integration
Working together in our supply chain on sustainability 
(including human rights)
As we rely on our suppliers to provide essential services, 
components and materials for our work, such as pylons, 
transformers, HVDC technology and power lines, we strive 
to ensure that none of them are, directly or indirectly, 
involved in conduct that does not meet our policies and 
quality standards. This can relate to product specifications 
and sustainability related topics, such as environmental 
performance or human rights, including a safe working 
environment. We make use of contractors and suppliers 
to realise our projects to build and maintain the grid. We 
purchase our components on world-wide markets and 
acknowledge that in other parts of the world different social 
and environmental standards may apply. Construction of 
our assets is being executed by local, national and 
international contractors.
In 2022, we took next steps with respect to human rights in 
our supply chain. We have gained more insights on our 
supplier landscape and have an updated risk assessment 
with salient human rights identified. With the globalisation of 
our supplier base, we find it essential to take responsibility 
and create impact through our human rights approach, 
This is why we have been working on our new Human 
Rights policy, which was introduced in 2022. We have 
integrated core principles of the UN Global Compact, of 
which we are a signatory member, the UN Guiding 
principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD 
guidelines in our new policy. This policy will act as a working 
document and will continue to be updated based on our 
experiences. We also included these principles in the update 
of our Supplier Code of Conduct. This is a mandatory step 
for all suppliers that want to work with us. We have put more 
emphasis on elements related to sustainability, including 
human rights, in this updated document.
Part of our approach in supply chain is to visit suppliers and 
ask them detailed questions, also regarding sustainability 
related topics. We believe that the responsibility of care 
for people and the planet is not limited to our own 
organisational boundaries. We also have a responsibility 
to ensure that this is also applied in the services and goods 
provided to us. If improvements are necessary, we try 
to work together with our contractors and suppliers by 
discussing together how these improvements can be made. 
In 2022, we performed 50 supplier visits (2021: 24). It is 
our policy to not accept suppliers who fail to meet our 
standards. In 2022, 43 suppliers met our standards 
(2021: 20), or were given the opportunity to take corrective 
actions. 4 suppliers were not approved (2021:3) and 
3 suppliers are awaiting the result of this visit. We aim to 
further enhance mechanisms such as our supplier visits 
to gain more insights into how we can work together on a 
common approach regarding sustainable business conduct 
in our supply chain. By working together with them, we aim 
to identify areas of improvement and work together so 
these items are followed up. The results and implementation 
of these areas of improvement are monitored by revisiting 
the supplier after follow up.

Working together with our suppliers to reduce our 
environmental impact
In 2022, we have made progress in working with our 
suppliers to tackle more sustainability challenges together. 
This has been added to the aforementioned integrated 
approach and jointly work on reducing emissions 
throughout our supply chains. More information on this has 
been included in the ‘Create value to transition to a climate

Our stakeholders
To deliver on our promise and ambitions, we believe that it 
is essential to work together with stakeholders and through 
partnerships. Through our activities as a TSO, we are 
already continuously interacting with the world around us. 
Our activities could not take place without the often 
intensive co-operation with other key players within- and 
outside the energy sector. We aim to build and maintain 
good relationships with our stakeholders and co-operate 
with them in partnerships to deliver on our strategic 
objectives.
In 2021, we reassessed our stakeholder landscape and 
identified the most important stakeholder groups, based on 
their influence on us- and our influence on them. We also 
engaged with these stakeholder groups to get their views 
on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that relate 
most to us as an organisation and the topics related to the 
impacts we as TenneT have on the world around us. Who 
we identified as our key stakeholder groups are represented 
in the visual below.
To monitor the way our stakeholders perceive us, we 
perform a reputation survey. Every two years, we conduct 
a survey to assess how well we are performing in the 
perception of our key stakeholders. This survey was 
performed among key stakeholders. The most recent 
survey was completed in 2022 and resulted in a score of 
7.8. which was classified as ‘strong’ and is higher than the 
average of the companies included in this survey (7.4).
Engaging with our stakeholders is crucial in achieving our 
strategic goals and serving our role in society. We value the 
engagement with local communities in our service areas 
and specifically in the areas where our assets are (to be) 
located. During stakeholder dialogues (such as workshops, 
online talks or events) we actively engage with local 
stakeholders and address any concern they might have 
regarding our projects. Moreover, we aim to engage with 
communities in our service area regardless of pending or 
planned projects to inform them about the societal role of 
TenneT. By informing local stakeholders about our role to 
secure electricity supply and driving the energy transition, 
we can emphasise the importance of the work we do.
This will help us in our work to construct and maintain the 
critical infrastructure required to drive the energy transition. 
It remains crucial to engage with local communities, but 
also with NGOs and politicians at the earliest stage of a 
project to address their concerns and gain their understanding. 
As we expand our network, we must do so responsibly, by 
building a dialogue and gaining acceptance with local 
communities.
As a result, our work involves a delicate balance: what is 
desired on a national level is not always welcomed by local 
communities. To meet this challenge, we aim to do this in a 
responsible, engaged and connected way. We act 
responsibly in how we fulfil our role in society, engaged in 
how we build acceptance for our actions and connected in 
our dialogue with stakeholders. When we start a new 
project, we engage with the stakeholders affected, listen to 
their concerns and needs, and provide information about 
the project to evaluate and discuss. Although we take the 
opinions of stakeholders seriously, receiving new opinions 
after we have already followed a due process to include 
opinions in an earlier stage might cause additional delays. 
We benefit from clear outcomes of our stakeholder 
engagement which enable us to plan and move ahead with 
certainty. The planning and licencing phases of our projects 
take up by far the most time in the realisation of our assets 
and with that, can slow the progress we need to drive the 
energy transition and achieve climate goals.
Podcast with stakeholders
In 2022, we also actively engaged in conversations with  
stakeholders in our own podcast. In it, we discussed topics  
around energy transition.  
You can listen back via tennet.eu/podcast (Dutch)  
or tennet-energiedialog.eu (German).

Listening to our stakeholders
At TenneT, we consider a good relationship and dialogue with our stakeholders to be essential. 
Especially an issue like energy transition cannot be tackled alone and requires close cooperation. 
In our reputation survey, we explicitly ask stakeholders every two years how they view us, also to 
learn from them and to improve ourselves. Stakeholder statements sometimes ask for this as well. 
Here are a few statements stakeholders made about TenneT in 2022.
“We are dismayed by TenneT's 
message, as we have high ambitions 
for renewable energy, the sustainability 
of business and economic growth. This 
notice limits the opportunities for new 
companies to establish themselves 
and makes expansion opportunities 
for established companies almost 
impossible.”
-  Deputy after TenneT made public that parts  
of the grid are congested -
Our response:
In 2022, TenneT had to announce in a number of 
provinces in the Netherlands that the maximum 
capacity of the grid there had been reached. 
This was a hard message for entrepreneurs in 
the provinces in particular. Several deputies were 
dissatisfied with the sudden announcement and 
the lack of perspective. TenneT learned from the 
approach last year. There is now also more structural 
cooperation on the file and governments, grid 
operators and companies are working together more.

‘Deliver a high security of supply’.

“There is no need for dinosaur 
pipelines if the energy transition is 
implemented decentrally and locally. 
In the end, this serves not only 
security of supply, but also a citizen-
friendly, environmentally friendly and 
economically sensible energy supply 
and creates added value in the region. 
That's why we don't need SuedLink as 
an electricity superhighway either.”
-  Representative of German “Bürgerinitiative” - 
Our response:
When building new infrastructure, we deal with many 
stakeholders in the area where new infrastructure is 
to be built. This often raises questions about whether 
the link is necessary and why it should be built 
here. We understand these questions. We carefully 
prepare the expansion of infrastructure. TenneT 
spends a lot of time and attention in the usefulness 
and necessity of new connections and also the 
spatial integration, which we aim to do in dialogue 
with the surrounding area.
  More information in our chapter  
‘Ensure critical infrastructure for society’.
“TenneT is insuffciently prepared for 
the future. One of the challenges is the 
shortage of technical staff, which is 
where TenneT can do more (alliances 
with MBO/HBO courses) ”
-  Stakeholder in our Reputation Survey - 
Our response:
The energy transition requires a major rebuilding of 
our system. This will require many people to help 
build high-voltage substations and new cables in the 
coming years. It is a challenge for the whole sector 
to find people who can contribute to this. TenneT 
is focusing on increasing the number of employees 
and on partnerships with educational institutions. We 
are also working with partners in the sector to make 
engineering more attractive.

The UN Sustainable Development Goals and TenneT
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were determined by the United Nations 
(UN) as global goals that Member States should translate into national policy. The aim 
of the SDGs is to create a sustainable future for all people. The co-operation between 
governments and other important partners, such as businesses and NGOs, are key to 
achieving these important goals. TenneT is committed to the SDGs and in 2021 we 
re-assessed which SDGs are most applicable to us. We reached out to our key 
stakeholder groups and discussed their views on this.
The outcome of this assessment has led to three SDGs 
that we believe we have the most impact on: the global 
challenges related to SDG 13 and SDG 7 and SDG 9 due 
to the core tasks we have as a company. To measure our 
contribution and impact, we have determined so-called 
'impact indicators', to assess how this affects society in 
the areas we serve. 
Current predictions indicate that 
governments and organisations need to 
step up to help mitigate the effects of 
climate change to meet the 1.5 degrees 
scenario from the Paris Agreement. As a cross-border 
TSO and a key player in the energy transition, we 
can help mitigate the effects of climate change by 
contributing to a climate-neutral future energy system. 
That is why we have identified SDG 13 ‘Climate 
Action’ as the main societal objective we contribute 
to. On the other hand, also our choices and business 
conduct impact the planet. This is why we measure 
our greenhouse gas emissions against Science Based 
Targets Initiative approved targets. We also report 
the amount of avoided emissions, which due to our 
activities, have been avoided on an annual basis. 
This is how we measure our positive and negative 
contribution regarding SDG target 13.2.
Target KPI Contribution 2022
13.2 Total greenhouse gas  
emissions (gross) 2,547,312 tonnes
7.2 Total avoided emissions 17.2 mio tonnes
With our core activities, we feel that SDG7 
is one of the SDGs we can contribute the 
most to. The underlying metrics related 
to this SDG is target 7.1 and 7.2. For 
target 7.1, we have developed an impact 
indicator to report on the societal financial impact we 
have on the electricity bill of a household. For target 
7.2 we measure the number of gigawatts of renewable 
energy that we are able to connect to our grid. For 
now, we start with the amount of offshore wind we 
have been able to connect compared to the ambitions 
of the governments in our service area and the onshore 
electricity that is directly connected to our grid. Over 
time, we introduce other parts that we enable by 
realising new infrastructure onshore.

Another goal we believe we contribute 
most to given our activities is SDG 9. 
Our role is particularly linked to target 9.1, 
where we focus on the availability of our 
infrastructure and how it supports and enables society. 
This is measured by the impact indicator showing the 
value we generate having our grid available and how 
this diminishes when we are unsuccessful in securing 
supply of electricity.
Target KPI Contribution 2022
9.1 Societal value of the 
availability of our grid
> GDP of the 
Netherlands
In the execution of our activities, we also have an 
impact on other SDGs. We contribute to SDG 5 and 
SDG 8 when we look at policies relating to our people 
(including our contractors) and SDG 12, SDG 14 
and SDG 15 with respect to the choices we make 
that affect our planet. SDG 12 for instance, relates to 
our circularity ambitions, which also has an effect on 
climate change. Reducing the use of virgin materials, 
such as copper, has a positive climate effect, as it 
avoids emissions in the extraction phase. That is why 
we track several KPIs related to the targets supporting 
these goals, but the effect on other SDGs are less 
significant than the ones related to the SDGs above. 
Our main SDGs relate to our core tasks, the others we 
see our responsibility to act upon.

Deliver a high security of supply
As the transmission system operator (TSO) for the Netherlands, and a significant part of Germany, 
TenneT owns and operates over 25,000 kilometres of high-voltage lines and cables. Our clear 
and critical task is to deliver electricity to nearly 43 million domestic and business users, safely 
and reliably, 24 hours a day and 365 days a year. This is what we call security of supply.
We describe our performance in 2022 in the following  
six chapters, each describing one of the six outputs/
outcomes as mentioned in our value creation model.
Our performance
in 2022
To do this, we design, build, maintain and operate a 
high-voltage grid stretching across land and sea. This 
carries electricity from where it is produced – including an 
increasing proportion of offshore wind energy – to where it 
is consumed. We carry it over ground via overhead lines, 
underground, under the sea and across borders, over our 
high-voltage grid. With a service level as high as 
99.99963%, the availability of our onshore grid is among 
the highest in the world.
Ensuring that people and businesses in the areas we serve 
have a secure supply of electricity, meets an important need 
in society. And as the transition to renewable energy 
sources and the goal of a sustainable energy future depend 
on the development of a new energy system, we directly 
contribute to the realisation of Europe’s ambition to be the 
world’s first climate-neutral continent by 2050.
As TenneT, we face an ongoing balancing act in our work: 
securing the supply of electricity today and tomorrow, 
driving the energy transition and doing so at an acceptable 
cost for society. This balance requires co-operation on 
many levels to tackle all the challenges we face.
As Europe accelerates its clean energy targets, our 
responsibilities are growing, and the time we have to meet 
them is shrinking. By 2030 the current ambitions are to 
have an energy system capable of supporting a 55% drop 
in EU carbon emissions, with net zero to be achieved in 
our German market by 2045.
To achieve this, our energy system is undergoing a 
development in which the grids - the backbone of the 
energy system - are being used in a completely different 
way. Our energy network was once built to meet the 
demand for energy on a mainly national scale. Now it is 
changing into a multifunctional hub of electricity supply, 
demand, storage and an international connector for 
European cross-border energy trade. To build a system 
capable of meeting these challenges and supporting 
Europe’s climate targets, we are focused on a grid 
development strategy to deliver a Target Grid in 2045  
(see ‘About TenneT – Our Strategy’).
The challenges of achieving this goal became even more 
complex in 2022, with the outbreak of the war in Ukraine. 
The humanitarian, geopolitical and energy crisis caused by 
the war has a substantial impact on TenneT’s activities, with 
rapid increases in energy and raw material prices, gas 
shortages and disrupted supply chains all creating difficult 
conditions across our sector (see ‘Secure supply today’ on 
the next page). A particular impact of the market volatility is 
seen in our procurement of balancing and ancillary services, 
including balancing reserves and redispatch, which we use

to balance demand and supply and to ensure the security 
and quality of electricity supply. Fast-rising gas and electricity 
prices led to a rapid increase in the costs of these ancillary 
services during 2022, reaching their highest-ever level. (see 
‘Safeguard sustainable financial performance and investor 
ratings’).
However, these developments have strengthened the 
urgency among European governments to reduce energy 
dependency, with a shared desire to boost energy security 
and independence. A renewables-based energy system in 
Europe is the key to achieving this, but, at the same time, all 
players in the system – TSOs, national governments, regulators 
and end-users – need to co-operate to reach this goal.

Our grid availability onshore had a slight 
decrease this year, due to interruptions in 
the 110/150 and 220/380 kV grid in the 
Netherlands. Despite these interruptions,

Secure supply today
TenneT’s most important task as a TSO is to secure the 
supply of electricity, now and in the future. This requires 
managing factors such as the changing mix of energy 
sources – including renewables alongside traditional 
sources – the integration of new technology and a growing 
demand for electricity from end-users. Our people, such as 
in our control centres and in the field, work hard to ensure 
that we are able to secure this supply of electricity, 24 hours 
a day.
Their efforts helped us to achieve, once again, a high-level 
availability of 99.99963% for our onshore grid and for our 
offshore grid 94.08% of the time. We report our onshore 
and offshore grid availability separately, as they are 
technically different. Our offshore connections have less 
built-in redundancy than our onshore grid. Unfortunately, 
there were also instances where we faced outages and we 
needed to respond. The duration of these interruptions 
however did not have a significant impact on our overall grid 
availability. An example of this is an incident that occurred 
between Lelystad and Dronten in the Netherlands. On 
2 September a short circuit lasting approximately 4 minutes, 
caused an outage in Flevoland. This short circuit severely 
overloaded the assets, resulting in damage to the overhead 
lines, some of the assets in Lelystad and Dronten-Olsterpad 
and the railway infrastructure of ProRail. TenneT is drawing 
lessons from the events. For instance, efforts are being 
made to raise even more awareness around switching on 
installations that may or may not be live. Extra attention is 
also needed for such switching operations and procedures 
for this are being tightened.
For our offshore grid, this was also the case with our 
interconnectors NorNed and COBRA. Our NorNed 
interconnector was out of service for a few months, initially 
caused by a cable failure on the Dutch side of the 
connection. During the cable repair and the root cause 
analysis severe quality deficiencies at the cable have been 
revealed, what was leading to further assessments of the 
cable prior to a possible reenergisation. As a result of the 
investigation, the 1.5 km onshore cable part has to be 
replaced because of reaching the end of lifetime. All 
measures have been taken to substitute this cable part as 
soon as possible, expected in Q2 2024. Additionally, we 
have taken several measures in order to reenergise NorNed 
whilst making sure to stress the onshore cable part as little 
as possible. Our interconnector COBRA failed in November 
2022. The failure was located on the Danish Island Fano. 
The failure was repaired in 28 days, as a result of good 
teamwork between EnergiNet, Prysmian and TenneT.

In 2022, several external factors intensified the challenge of 
maintaining security of supply. In particular, the war in 
Ukraine caused upheaval in the energy markets. A prime 
example of co-operation was seen during 2022 when 
ENTSO-E synchronised the power systems of Ukraine and 
Moldova with the continental European network. This 
emergency work, soon after the commencement of the war 
in Ukraine, was completed in a matter of just over two 
weeks in March 2022. Previously Ukraine was connected to 
the Russian power system, therefore it was essential to 
bring it into the European system as soon as possible. 
TenneT is proud to have been involved in this 
synchronisation.
The shortage of gas resulting from the war in Ukraine forced 
several countries to turn to alternative power supplies to 
secure their load. For example, the Dutch government 
decided to temporarily re-direct some generation demand 
to coal-fired plants, so that it could focus on stocking up 
gas supplies for the winter. The same applied for Germany, 
where the German government initiated a programme to 
bring conventional power plants from their current reserve 
status back to the energy market. Also the last three 
remaining nuclear power plants in Germany that had been 
planned to be phased out in Q4 2022, were ordered to 
remain operational until mid April 2023.
European TSOs also faced other energy market challenges in 
2022 that affected security of supply. A sharp reduction in the 
availability of nuclear generation capacity in France – due to 
widespread repairs - and the low water levels in hydro power 
plants at many of the European countries – subsequently 
lowered the capability for energy exports. In addition to this, 
the dry summer of 2022 led to lower water levels in many 
rivers – including the Rhine in Germany – which hampered 
the transportation of coal. These and other pressures on the 
energy market in 2022 are causing TenneT and other TSOs to 
evaluate and coordinate at a European level the security of 
their supply. Every year TenneT performs such an analysis to 
determine potential effects and measures, both in the 
Netherlands and in Germany. Based on this analysis, there 
were no additional measures deemed necessary in the 
Netherlands. In Germany, the German ministry of Economic 
Affairs and Climate Action requested the German TSOs to 
conduct an in-depth additional analysis to assess the 
electricity supply situation from a generation and transmission 
adequacy perspective and to determine system needs for 
winter 2022/2023. Several scenarios and solutions were 
presented to the German government. The recommendations 
required timely government action to secure supply of 
electricity in the winter of 2022/2023, which has resulted in 
several actions, such as better utilisation of the grid by 
dynamic line rating, usage of high-temperature conductors 
and load flow steering assets, as well as the aforementioned 
actions regarding nuclear and coal-fired plants in Germany. 
Congestion situation in the Netherlands
Rapid developments in the energy market due 
to high gas prices, the war in Ukraine and the 
ensuing energy uncertainty have led to a number of 
new congestion areas on the electricity grid in the 
Netherlands in 2022. In June, a temporary stop on 
new grid connections for businesses was announced 
in the provinces of Noord-Brabant and Limburg. The 
number of connection requests from new solar parks, 
companies wanting to electrify and the growing 
number of heat pumps and charging stations grew 
faster than the grid can be expanded. 
 
Immediately after the announcement, the Minister 
of Climate and Energy set up a task force with all 
stakeholders such as governments, interest groups 
and grid operators to find solutions to grid scarcity 
and also develop a national action programme. 
This national action programme was published 
in December. It includes measures to speed up 
grid expansions, flexible contract forms, better 
programming and also to make ‘smarter’ use of the 
existing grid by focusing on flexibility. 
 
In Noord-Brabant and Limburg, TenneT created extra 
capacity by focusing on congestion management 
measures, similar to traffic congestion avoidance. 
This involves paying users a fee to relieve the grid at 
busy times. The possibility of applying this to other 
areas in 2023 is also being investigated. Network 
congestion will remain a part of the transition in 
the coming years. Through co-operation between 
government, grid operators and industry, we can 
take the right steps towards a climate-neutral 
energy supply.

Beyond creating uncertainty in the energy landscape, 
the war in Ukraine has also further accelerated demand 
for electricity. To avoid escalating gas bills, many 
households are switching to electricity for heating and 
business users are moving over to electrification for 
industrial processes earlier than planned. This includes 
energy-intensive industries, such as steel, aluminium, 
copper and chemistry. Following this surge in electrification, 
we saw an increasing number of requests from customers 
to connect to our grid in 2022 (see our section on 
‘Congestion situation in the Netherlands’).
Despite these challenges, the current geopolitical situation 
and energy market volatility in Europe represent a unique 
opportunity to accelerate the energy transition and build 
societal and political understanding and support for 
TenneT’s work. With European governments being more 
proactive and ambitious in reducing their dependence on 
gas imports, and increasing the pace of electrification, there 
is renewed unity and urgency behind energy security and 
the energy transition.
In 2022, we faced additional challenges in our grid due to 
growing congestion. An example of when this could occur 
is when for instance in Germany a high feed-in of renewable 
energy sources in the North – such as on very windy days – 
needs to be transmitted to the load centres in the South, 
and cannot be fully accommodated due to the limited 
available transmission capacity of the high-voltage grid 
without causing overloads. This endangers our security of 
supply as electricity cannot be transmitted across overloaded 
powerlines. Therefore redispatch actions are applied to bring 
the system back to secure and adequate limits.
Securing supply tomorrow
For TenneT, planning and building a future-proof energy 
system that provides security of supply tomorrow is made 
more challenging because of the fast-changing nature of the 
energy system. The volatile and intermittent nature of wind 
and solar power, and the long distances between where 
power is generated and where it is consumed create entirely 
new technological, engineering and market challenges for 
TSOs. Innovation will be critical to meet these challenges, 
not only related to more effective and efficient use of our 
assets, but also to boost our system operations and 
improve market design. To achieve this, there are three 
focus areas that will be essential for securing supply in the 
future: grid reinforcement, market integration and system 
operations developments.
Flexibility

Grid reinforcement
Grid reinforcement is not only essential to reduce the 
pressure on our grid today, but also to prepare it for the 
increasing demands and dynamics of the future energy 
system. This is also a way to prevent congestion, next to 
the congestion management measures we have taken to 
relieve pressure on the grid at the busiest times. In several 
areas of our grid we are increasing capacity. 
The fast-growth of generation capacity in the North Sea 
requires an increase in transmission capacity in the offshore 
and part of the onshore grids. On top of this, the rapid shift 
to electrification in society is further increasing the need for 
reinforcement and additional capacity. The electricity grid 
was built over a century ago, with parts of our onshore grid 
also realised in the 1960s and 1970s. With the distance 
between the generation and consumption of electricity 
becoming greater in the past decades, our grid needs to be 
updated to cope with this demand and urgently requires 
modernisation and reinforcement. Substantial work is 
underway in the Netherlands and Germany to deliver these 
reinforcements and ensure our grid has the capacity and 
flexibility to cope with changing energy needs. The 
construction of the new HVDC corridors in Germany – 
SuedLink and SuedOstLink – as well as the upgrading of 
five 380 kV overhead lines in the Netherlands, are just some 
examples of our extensive reinforcement work. For more 
details on our grid reinforcement projects see ‘Ensure a 
critical infrastructure’ chapter.

Market integration
Market integration is at the centre of the European Union’s 
ambition to create a single European electricity market. 
Working closely with other TSOs, TenneT is taking a 
prominent role in this development.
An interconnected European electricity market has physical 
and commercial aspects. TenneT is actively involved in 
both, for example by building cross-border interconnectors 
that allow neighbouring countries to seamlessly exchange 
energy, and also by facilitating the commercial electricity 
market between European countries.
As for the physical connection of European grids across 
borders, TenneT has now built 17 interconnectors, 
connecting our grid with the grids from other TSOs. For full 
details of our cross-border connections see the grid map on 
our website. A major landmark in market facilitation was 
reached in 2022. Together with 14 other TSOs, we 
introduced a new mechanism to further integrate the 
European electricity market, making it more efficient and 
robust. The new Day-Ahead Flow-Based Market Coupling 
Mechanism enables the European power grid to transmit 
more electricity across borders at a lower overall cost. 
With the introduction of flow-based capacity calculation, the 
network capacity is typically calculated taking the whole 
regional grid into account, as well as the economic value of 
the energy exchanges. Now, electricity delivery across 
borders within the CORE region (Austria, Belgium, Croatia, 
the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, 
Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia 
and Slovenia) is optimised by allocating capacity to the 
flows with the highest economical value. This means in 
general a larger value of electricity can be exchanged 
between zones.
Furthermore, TenneT also collaborates with other TSOs and 
market parties to boost security of supply through market 
integration initiatives. For example, TenneT is one of many 
European TSOs involved in the Platform for the International 
Coordination of Automated Frequency Restoration 
and Stable System Operation (PICASSO) and the Manually 
Activated Reserves Initiative (MARI) – two projects that 
facilitate the European-wide exchange of balancing energy. 
The PICASSO platform went live in June 2022, with MARI 
following in September 2022. All four German TSOs 
connected to the platform in October 2022.
System Operations developments
As well as building new assets and facilitating the electricity 
markets, we must also invest in new concepts for operating 
the grid, operating a more dynamic system and making a 
more efficient and optimised use of our system through new 
digital solutions. As our grid becomes more dependent on 
renewable energy sources, our Energy System Planning 
(ESP) team is exploring multiple solutions to ease 
congestion, improve reliability and manage power flows 
across the grid. By improving the predictability and stability 
of the grid, we can reduce the need to use conventional 
power sources to keep the grid in balance, which will 
therefore help to reduce increasingly high redispatch costs. 
Two techniques we are using for these purposes include 
phase-shifting transformers and mechanically switched 
capacitor with damping network (MSCDN) technology. 
Phase-shifting transformers allow us to influence power 
flows in the grid, by reducing or increasing the transferred 
power. This control improves our ability to balance the 
volatility of renewable energy sources, such as wind and 
solar. TenneT installed the first four units of this technology 
in the southern substation of Wuergau and will install four 
more in Krempermarsch, in the northern part of Germany. In 
coming years, the German TSOs, including TenneT, are 
expected to reinforce the grid with 36 phase-shifting 
transformers. MSCDN is a grid stabilisation technology that 
allows us to absorb voltage fluctuations in a substation and 
thereby stabilise the operation of the transmission grid.
Another important development to make our systems 
resilient for years to come is our Control Room of the Future 
(CROF) programme, which relates to, among others, the 
update of our current operational system. The CROF has 
the ambition to develop methodologies, processes and 
tools in order to guarantee excellence at system operations, 
including among others improved forecasts, dynamic 
security assessment, inertia monitoring, and topology 
optimisation. More information on this can be found in 
the ‘Solve societal challenges with stakeholders and 
through partnerships’ chapter.
Flexibility in demand and supply of electricity
Flexibility will be crucial to cope with the unpredictability and 
volatility of renewable energy sources, while reducing the 
need for grid expansion. Flexibility is how TSOs refer to 
using on-demand energy sources to keep the grid secure 
and in balance. Traditionally, TSOs used fossil-fueled power 
plants to guarantee an adequate system and to maintain a 
balance between electricity supply and demand. However, 
with more renewable energy sources being fed into the grid, 
supply and demand becomes more volatile impacting

system balance and power flows within the grid. In addition, 
clean energy targets increasingly restrict TSOs’ opportunity 
to use conventional power as a source of flexibility 
As a solution, TenneT, along with other TSOs, is looking 
for new sources of flexibility. Storing electricity in energy 
carriers, like battery energy systems and hydrogen, is 
an important area of focus, as they provide low-carbon 
on-demand flexibility. The challenge is to achieve this at 
the scale needed for a fully decarbonised energy system 
and how to integrate widely distributed sources of stored 
electricity into the grid. The location of flexible energy 
sources will also become increasingly critical – for example 
placing large electrolysers near the coast where offshore 
wind is landed to shore. Innovation and partnerships are 
critical in TenneT’s flexibility strategy. (For more detail on 
innovations in Flexibility see the ‘Solve societal challenges 
with stakeholders and through partnerships’ chapter).
TenneT has been driving various initiatives in co-operation 
with other grid operators and market partners to make 
distributed flexibility available for the grid through the 
optimisation of data exchange processes between 
market parties and promotion of the use of distributed 
flexibility options.
For example, TenneT has started several pilot projects 
to include smaller flexibility options into congestion 
management processes. In Germany, from 2022 onwards, 
plants and storage devices above 100 kW will be available 
for redispatch (today the limit is above 10 MW). In the 
Netherlands TenneT is strongly engaged in the GOPACS 
(grid operator platform for congestion solutions) initiative 
together with the Dutch DSO’s.
By 2035, Germany expects to have technology-specific 
flexibilities of almost 80 GW from distributed flexibility 
options, such as electric vehicles, heat pumps and home 
storage. TenneT is also one of the TSOs behind Equigy, a 
pan-European project to efficiently integrate distributed 
flexibilities into the grid. More examples, such as the GAIA-X 
project we participate in, can be found in the ‘Solve societal 
challenges with stakeholders and through partnerships’ 
chapter.
System resilience
As the transmission grid is the backbone of economic and 
social activity, it is regarded as critical infrastructure and as 
such requires maximum protection from both physical 
threats (such as extreme weather events) and digital threats, 
such as terrorist or cyber-threats. For TenneT, this protection 
is not only essential for national security, but also to maintain 
the 99.99963% grid availability that end-users expect from us.
Societal value of the availability of our grid
Transmitting electricity to large industries and 
via DSOs to millions of households powers and 
empowers society. This is our main task and also 
our main societal impact as a company. Designing, 
building, maintaining and operating a grid that is 
available all the time is the most important impact 
TenneT can have for society, to ensure that the 
people living in the areas we serve are able to live 
their lives and organisations can do their work. 
Achieving this impact requires each part of the 
energy supply chain to work together, therefore 
this achievement is not just the result of our own 
actions, but this societal impact we make together 
with others in the supply chain, such as electricity 
generation companies, other TSOs and distribution 
system operators. 
However, an electricity grid that is available to 
supply electricity to its customers for 99.99963% 
of the time creates value. Our assessment, based 
on academic research, shows that the estimated 
societal value created by the availability of our Dutch 
grid surpasses the gross domestic product (GDP) of 
the Netherlands, which was over EUR 850 billion in 
2021. This is because the supply of electricity does 
not only create economic value, but also direct and 
indirect benefits, such as being able to enjoy leisure 
time. For more information on this assessment and 
our methodology, please refer to the Additional CSR 
data document on our website. We will continue 
to further develop societal impact indicators during 
the next years and invite others to help us with this.

Cyber threats are encountered almost daily by European grid 
operators, demonstrating the need for constant vigilance. 
Growing geo-political tensions in the world, most notably 
with Russia, further intensify the need for protection of our 
critical infrastructure and IT networks.
As our grid operation becomes increasingly digitalised 
and data-dependent, we are aware that the risks of cyber 
threats grow with more points in our system to target. 
With every new large project we conduct to expand and 
modernise the grid in the Netherlands and Germany, we 
pay close attention to mitigating security risks, overseen 
by our growing team of experts. Thanks to our prevention 
measures, TenneT has successfully deflected numerous 
cyber-threats in recent years.
As the guardians of critical infrastructure, we co-operate  
fully with the authorities on cyber protection and fulfil all legal 
requirements. In Germany, TenneT is certified according 
to the BNetzA security catalogue, based on the ISO 27001 
security standard. We also voluntarily apply this standard in 
the Netherlands to harmonise cyber security at the highest 
possible standard. The efficiency and effectiveness of our 
cyber-protection procedures are demonstrated annually 
to an external certification body. We frequently perform 
penetration tests, with support of external consultants, 
to check the resilience of our IT infrastructure.
In addition to cyber-threats, we also need to protect our 
assets against physical threats, such as the theft of valuable 
raw materials, such as copper, which is targeted due to 
its high market price, or threats related to climate related 
events. And, as we are building high-value assets near the 
busy shipping area of the Dutch and German North Sea, we 
need to protect against accidental collisions and damage.
TenneT closely monitors the physical security related to 
our infrastructure, both on- and offshore. To determine 
and assess the actual threat levels, we are closely working 
together with relevant stakeholders, such as governmental 
institutions and other companies in critical infrastructure. 
Next to measures that e.g. governments can take in the 
areas we serve, TenneT takes a spectrum of measures 
based on our assessments to reduce the risks and 
vulnerabilities. 
This can be caused for instance by extreme weather events, 
which we see more frequently due to the effects of climate 
change. A good example of how we cope with these 
growing threats to our physical infrastructure, is the event 
related to Hollandse Kust (beta), where a vessel collided with 
the jacket of this offshore grid connection system. 
In January 2022, a cargo ship lost anchorage during a storm 
and drifted into a collision with the jacket foundation of this 
offshore substation. In designing our assets, we strive to 
take the effects of extreme weather events related to the 
area these are built into account. The necessity of this is 
underpinned by the recent extreme weather events. 
What could prevent us from realising our goals?
As our electricity supply relies more and more on weather-
dependent sources, we face more challenges on how we 
operate our grid in its current form and also how to plan for 
its expansion. As one of our challenges for the coming years, 
TenneT has to address the risk of congestion when it is not 
possible to connect new customers to the in-feed of 
renewable energy. When there is congestion, we need to 
provide alternative sources of power, which raises the 
financial question of rising redispatch costs that, in the end, 
society has to pay for.
For TenneT connecting and co-operating with partners 
(either political or the market) who have the knowledge and 
expertise or the technology needed to secure supply today 
and tomorrow becomes more and more important. For 
instance by exchanging experiences with European TSOs via 
ENTSO-E, to retain political support for long term planning of 
our assets, but also to attract the right partners who can 
support us in our climate ambition or new markets such as 
hydrogen or battery storage.
New technologies help us mitigate risks related to security of 
supply, particularly controllability capabilities and digitalisation 
has a potential to make optimal use of our grid. For example, 
data analytics can help us gain insights on how we can use 
weather predictions, assess real-time electricity demand, 
survey our assets and also help us keep the grid secure 
and in balance by connecting to an increasing number of 
producers and consumers. However, although technology 
will play a crucial role in realising the energy transition, 
there are currently no decisive breakthroughs that will 
simultaneously guarantee security of supply, affordability 
for society and competitiveness of industry prices.
The last couple of years showed us that climate change 
can pose significant challenges to security of supply. 
The droughts that led to hydropower shortages, and the 
growing frequency and risk of floods, storms and fires, 
threaten the stability of the electricity market. And as 
our system is increasingly getting more dependent on 
renewables, extreme weather can challenge security of 
supply in other ways. Making better use of available weather 
predictions could help us anticipate when extreme 
conditions could occur.

of supply
As heat pumps and distributed energy become a bigger part of our energy 
system, they will bring additional demands on the grid. But smart control of these 
appliances can help to solve these demands, as well as providing new ways to help 
balance the grid. 
“Everyday at work I try hard to put our users’ needs at the very core of our activity 
through solving purposeful challenges for society. Like having heat pumps run when the 
sun is shining. And have them not run when the grid needs a lower demand. Providing 
grid services on residential level with the Viessmann heat pumps of our users was 
defnitely one of the highlights of 2022. Kudos to our TenneT colleagues which helped 
to make the ViFlex project happen by releasing the “Flexmodus” to our users!”

Ensure critical infrastructure for society
TenneT is one of Europe’s largest investors in national and cross-border transport capacity on 
land and at sea. As such, our infrastructure will be key to Europe’s ambition to be a climate-
neutral continent by 2050 as we deliver a grid predominantly supplied by renewable energy 
sources, in line with the Paris Agreement and national climate targets. As well as planning for 
the future, we need our current and often ageing asset base to be maintained and in good 
working order, keeping the lights on and meeting fast-rising demands for electricity. 
In 2022, our grid and the wider energy market experienced 
the consequences of the war in Ukraine, with higher energy 
prices, inflation, resource scarcity and supply chain 
disruption. Maintaining the pace of our investments in new 
critical infrastructure, while also maintaining our existing 
assets, was particularly demanding in this unpredictable 
context. At the same time, these geopolitical developments 
mean an acceleration of green energy targets and a raising 
of political ambition to achieve energy independence 
through renewables. As a result, 2022 saw governments 
become more proactive in orchestrating the energy 
transition and national industrial policy.
For example, in May 2022, the Esbjerg Declaration 
highlighted the role of North Sea offshore wind in 
strengthening the EU’s energy security. The leaders of the 
European Commission, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands 
and Germany pledged to expand the combined North Sea 
offshore-wind capacity of the four countries to 65 GW by 
2030 and 150 GW by 2050. Almost two-thirds of this - 
40 GW - is accounted for by TenneT, with approximately 
20 GW each in the German and Dutch North Sea. TenneT 
will deliver new connections to implement these ambitions 
within the next 10 years.
To accelerate offshore development, the Dutch government 
updated the Offshore Development Framework in June 
2022, while the German government published a new draft 
site development plan in July. Both plans significantly 
increase offshore wind ambitions and require more projects 
to be delivered around the 2030 timeframe. As a result, 
TenneT has been asked to deliver fourteen 2 GW HVDC 
offshore grid-connection systems between 2028 and 2031 
in both countries.
To accommodate these offshore developments, we also 
need to expand and strengthen our onshore infrastructure. 
In 2022, we added approximately 500 km of additional 
connections, both overhead and underground. In addition, 
we were proud of the reinforcement and maintenance work 
we performed to boost transmission capacity and our 
innovation efforts so we can drive higher utilisation of our 
existing assets.
Ultimately, the combination of energy market uncertainty, 
the urgency of energy security and the accelerated shift 
from fossil fuels to renewable electricity make our 
investments in critical infrastructure more crucial than ever.

Our performance in 2022
The war in Ukraine and resulting energy crisis made 
tendering for key strategic projects significantly more 
challenging, not only because of rising costs but also due 
to supply chain disruption and the need to find alternative 
sources of critical materials, such as steel procured from 
Russia and Belarus. Many of our suppliers also faced their 
own supply chain difficulties, creating knock-on effects 
through the system.

Despite these challenges, our focus in 2022 and in coming 
years is all about increasing our outputs. In 2022, we 
invested EUR 4.5 billion in the grid, a 13% increase 
compared to EUR 4.0 billion in 2021. With energy security in 
the spotlight, we focused on both short-term and long-term 
solutions to deliver on our critical task: ensuring the 
continuous availability of electricity for nearly 43 million 
end-users across the Netherlands and Germany.
Onshore
The share of electricity in the energy mix is expected to grow 
from 20% today to 40-60% in 2050. To make sure we can 
facilitate this demand, and connect the growing infeed of 
renewables, we need to expand, strengthen and modernise 
our onshore grid. To alleviate the current pressure on our 
existing grid, we plan to invest substantially in the Dutch and 
German onshore grid in the next decade. 
Long-distance DC ‘green corridors’
A key factor in alleviating pressure on the onshore grid is the 
development of long-distance high-voltage green-energy 
‘superhighways’ – running from the North Sea coast where 
wind energy is carried onshore to the areas where the 
energy is most needed, such as in the south and west of 
Germany. TenneT is co-operating with TransnetBW and 
50Hertz respectively for the development of two major 
north-south corridors in Germany – SuedLink and 
SuedOstLink. When operational, these high-capacity DC 
connections will be among the most important in Germany 
for achieving climate neutrality and energy security. SuedLink 
is a 700 km connection linking Brunsbüttel (in Schleswig-
Holstein) to Bergrheinfeld -West (in Bayern), while 
SuedOstLink is a more than 500 km connection linking 
Wolmirstedt (in Saxony-Anhalt) to Landshut (in Bavaria). Both 
corridors have a capacity of 4 GW and will run completely 
underground. They are expected to be operational in 2028. 
In addition, there is a plan to bridge the two connections 
with a third DC corridor, the NordOstLink. This would 
connect the North Sea coast at Schleswig-Holstein to the 
Schwerin area in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, further 
contributing to the reliable transmission of offshore wind 
energy to the onshore grid.
Both SuedLink and SuedOstLink have started the final 
approval procedure and are preparing for the construction 
phase. For SuedLink, this requires the construction of a 
four-metre-diameter and around five-kilometre-long tunnel 
under the Elbe River, with substantial engineering works. In 
2022, the contracts for the last two converter stations in 
Wilster and Bergrheinfeld/West were awarded. 
For SuedOstLink, production, delivery and assembly of the 
second underground cabling system is due to take place in 
2024/2025. As with SuedLink, much of the cabling has 
already been ordered and is in stock ready for installation. In 
2021, two converter stations were already awarded. In both 
projects, strong long-term partnerships with fellow TSOs 
TransnetBW and 50Hertz, as well as with key contractors 
and suppliers are key in boosting progress and momentum.
‘Beter Benutten’
Making more use of our existing assets is a key part of our 
onshore grid reinforcement work, helping our grid meet 
higher transmission demands next to building new lines. 
This work helps strike the balance between affordability, 
security of supply and sustainability. An example of this 
work in action is our new Better Use of Existing 380 kV 
programme (‘Beter Benutten’) in the Netherlands.
The programme consists of several individual 380 kV 
overhead line reinforcement projects. The first project 
(between Lelystad and Ens) was commissioned in 2020, the 
second one in 2022 (between Diemen and Lelystad). The 
next projects are planned to be commissioned over the next 
few years and consist of the sections between Krimpen and 
Geertruidenberg (execution 2022-2023), between Ens and 
Zwolle (execution 2023), Rilland and Zandvliet (execution 
2023) and Eindhoven and Maasbracht (execution 2024-2026).
More highlights in 2022 showcasing how we extended 
or strengthened our onshore grid
• In Emden-Conneforde, TenneT delivered a new 61 
km-long high-capacity 380 kV power line. This new 
connection can transmit three-and-a-half times as much 
electricity as the previous one. It will primarily transmit and 
distribute wind power from the North Sea.
• The Westküstenleitung (West Coast line) in Schleswig-
Holstein between Brunsbüttel and the border with 
Denmark has a total length of around 140 km. Five 
substations are also being delivered as part of this 
project. In November 2022, the fourth section of the 
380 kV line was commissioned. With the final and fifth 
section, the entire project is planned to be completed 
towards the end of 2023.
• With an increasing amount of renewable energy being fed 
into the grid in Schleswig-Holstein, it is necessary to 
expand the existing grid structure. The planned Wahle-
Mecklar line will connect the transformer substation in 
Wahle near Braunschweig in Lower Saxony with Mecklar, 
near the Ludwigsau transformer substation in Hesse. The 
230 km connection includes a 380 kV overhead line with 
three underground cabling sections as well as five 
substations. In 2022, sections A and B with a length of

105 km were successfully commissioned, one substation 
was finished and construction activities in the last two 
sections C and D continued. The aim is to complete this 
project during 2024.
• The Ostbayernring aims to increase transmission 
capacity of the current connections and prepare the grid 
for a growing infeed of renewables. It includes the 
construction of a 185 km transmission corridor 
connecting Redwitz to Schwandorf in the south-east of 
Germany. Construction works have started in 2022.
• On the 52 km Diemen-Lelystad-Ens connection, we 
have replaced and reinforced existing lines and pylons to 
increase the transmission capacity. The project is a pilot 
to explore reduced lead times. While the first section was 
already commissioned in 2020, in March 2022 the 
technical upgrade of the second section was completed 
which means that the connection is now technically 
suitable for transmitting more electricity. We are also 
expanding transmission capacity on the 
Geertruidenberg-Krimpen connection.
• On the 150 kV connection between Tilburg and Best, 
TenneT is reinforcing the grid and replacing overhead 
lines with underground cables using the horizontal drilling 
method. In a pilot in 2022, horizontal drilling was applied 
over a distance of almost 2000 meters. This method 
minimises negative impacts on society and environment. 
Maintenance
As TenneT’s onshore grid comes under more pressure, 
with increased loads and fast-growing demand for new 
connections, it is not only important to extend our network 
but also to maximise the use of our existing assets. In this 
respect, it is essential to maintain our grid so that all our 
existing assets are available for use, have a maximum 
lifecycle and perform their intended function. In doing so, 
we not only boost security of supply but also improve 
affordability for society. Maintenance accounts for 
approximately 40% of our investments as a TSO, 
for both Germany and the Netherlands.
Future solutions for DC overlay grid
Steering fast-growing volumes of wind power more 
efficiently to where it is consumed is being explored 
through the future development of a high-voltage 
meshed DC overlay grid, connecting offshore and 
onshore and across borders.
The advantage of DC is that large capacities of 
electricity can be transmitted – 2 GW per cable 
system – over longer distances with lower grid 
losses. Currently, DC connections are only point-to-
point, so if there is a failure the whole line is down. 
With a meshed network of DC connections, with 
circuit-breakers, we can steer the DC load even in 
the event of a failure. Additionally, it avoids the need 
for converting electricity to AC and back to DC at 
critical nodes in the grid and helps to increase grid 
utilisation of our assets. 
This is a large-scale, long-term project. Achieving 
it involves ground-breaking innovations, such 
as the development of DC circuit-breakers that 
do not currently exist at scale, and standardised 
interconnected DC convertors.
Part of this plan will be the construction of 
innovative multi-terminal DC hubs. In 2022, TenneT 
signed an agreement with fellow German TSO 
50Hertz to realise a pilot multi-terminal DC hub 
in the area of Heide (Schleswig-Holstein) and has 
also co-operated with Amprion on the Rastede 
hub. We are confident that DC hub solutions are 
more efficient than point-to-point DC connections, 
because they require fewer converters. This saves 
on cost and reduces the environmental impact. 
However, to realise this ambition we need a multi-
vendor market for DC connectors, not only for 
cost efficiency, but also so the convertors can be 
interconnected and communicated in a meshed 
grid.
TenneT is using learnings from our onshore hub 
projects to move forward with offshore DC hub 
development. For example, TenneT has co-
developed a concept of combined offshore-energy 
systems. The idea is to connect wind farms to 
different countries and at the same time set up a 
direct electrical interconnection between these 
countries at lower cost. With its partners, TenneT 
is working towards a first internationally connected 
offshore wind-power hub in the North Sea.

With some assets in our network dating back to the 1960s 
and 1970s, part of our maintenance work is concerned with 
the replacement of obsolete assets with new equipment. To 
ease this process, we aim to standardise and modularise 
our equipment as much as possible, making it easier and 
more efficient to fit and maintain assets that share common 
design and components. The modules can also be tested 
and configured in a controlled environment before 
installation. We are following this ‘plug and play’ approach 
with our Bay Replacement programme, for example, 
currently in pilot phase before going to full scale roll-out, 
replacing more than 140 end-of-life substations.
And with many new assets being added to the grid, our 
maintenance team has to cover a growing network. With a 
scarcity of technical personnel to boost our maintenance 
team’s capacity, we aim to mitigate this through increased 
efficiency, working smarter with new technology and 
routines. For example, with our Delivery Booster initiative, 
in which our colleagues in the field suggest ideas for 
improved efficiency and streamlined maintenance 
processes. Delivery Booster has become a successful way 
to drive efficiency from the ground up, freeing up additional 
time and resources so we can perform more work.
We are also boosting our training capacity to get new 
maintenance colleagues into the field faster. For example in 
the Cre@Te program, where we focus on hiring, training and 
retaining 'critical resources', meaning our specialist 
colleagues in technical functions. In the last two years, we 
have been able to hire more than 90 FTE through this 
program. In a dedicated indoor training centre, new 
colleagues were trained on the knowledge and skills needed 
for these functions while operating in a safe environment 
without high voltage. We will continue to focus on the 
growth of these critical employees, making sure they are 
better trained and also demanding less from the current 
employees in the field. 
Finally, we have introduced a new approach to Integrated 
Planning, allowing us to centralise all the demands on our 
field resources to help us plan and prioritise the tasks 
ahead. Making clear choices on the most and less urgent 
tasks is an important part of allocating our resources most 
efficiently.
Offshore
In the European Green Deal, the European Union (EU) has 
set itself the ambition of realising around 300 GW of 
offshore generation capacity in Europe by 2050, supporting 
its aim to become the first climate-neutral continent. As 
TenneT already operates more than half the offshore wind 
connections in the EU and is one of the world leaders in 
connecting offshore wind farms to the onshore grid, we 
are ready for the challenge of connecting around 40 GW of 
offshore wind energy to the Dutch and German grid by 2030.
The North Sea plays an important role in these ambitions 
as it has the potential to be Europe’s clean-energy ‘power 
house’ of the future. Realising these ambitions in a 
sustainable and environmentally friendly manner will require 
international co-operation among European governments, 
fellow TSOs, NGOs and other stakeholders. Wind farms will 
need to be interconnected across countries, supported by 
distribution hubs and high-performance grid infrastructure. 
This vision will be key to boosting energy security in Europe, 
enabling a transition away from fossil fuels.
Doubling connection capacity with the 2GW Program
The innovative 2GW Program is a key element in TenneT's 
offshore strategy and plays a crucial role in delivering the 
offshore wind capacity needed for Europe’s energy goals. 
The programme combines a new technological, 
administrative, and contractual standard with a unique and 
holistic transnational approach. Carried out in a forward-
looking market design it provides a blueprint for future 
offshore grid connections, enabling higher wind capacity to 
be connected faster and at a lower cost. After a strong raise 
in offshore wind energy targets both in Germany and the 
Netherlands, the 2GW Program will now deliver at least 
14 offshore grid connection systems by 2031.
The programme’s innovative 525 kV HVDC cross-linked 
polyethylene (XLPE) cable system is a technological 
quantum leap. Meanwhile, the new platform design and a 
2 GW HVDC transmission system set a new industry-wide 
standard for offshore grid connection systems. If TenneT 
were to continue using our previous cables, such as the 
700 MW AC cable in the Netherlands or the 900 MW DC 
cable in Germany, it would need to build 40-50 new 
connections to reach the 2031 target for offshore wind. 
For 28 GW of green energy, TenneT now only needs 14 grid 
connections – less than half the number of what would be 
needed if using previous systems. This will strongly 
reduce the workload and save time, money, and resources 
in the process.
To support acceleration in offshore grid development and 
ensure capacity in the supplier market, TenneT invited to 
tender for two major framework agreements with key 
market partners for a period of up to eight years. Following 
this approach, TenneT released two large-scale EU tenders 
for offshore – one for at least 15 grid connection systems, 
including offshore and onshore stations as well as the

corresponding HVDC systems in June and one for more 
than ten cable systems in September. Both tenders are 
expected to be awarded in Q1/Q2 2023.
This approach brings together the right actors at the right 
time. It will stimulate the market as a whole. It will pool 
know-how, create synergies, and increase and secure 
essential market capacities for Europe. In doing so, TenneT 
has developed a concrete action plan to further accelerate 
offshore grid development in the North Sea and beyond.
More highlights in 2022 to develop our offshore grid:
• In June, we received grid readiness certificates for 
both Hollandse Kust (Zuid) grid connections, with 
a 1,400 MW transmission high-voltage connection for 
the offshore wind farms Hollandse Kust (Zuid) I and II.
• In September, TenneT completed the rollout of the 
Hollandse Kust (Noord) topside transformer platform, 
for installation 18.5 km off the coast of the Netherlands. 
The platform will be followed by two more – each with 
700 MW capacity – to bring green electricity from the 
Hollandse Kust (Noord) wind farm onto the onshore grid. 
The wind farm is expected to be operational in 2023.
• In the third quarter of 2022, the jacket of Hollandse 
Kust (West Alpha) was installed. This is an offshore 
transformer-grid connection system, some 50 km off 
the coast of Egmond. 
• In August, TenneT marked a major milestone in bringing 
more green wind power from the German North Sea, 
with the sail-out of the offshore platform DolWin 
Kappa. After three years of construction, the platform 
was transported from Spain and installed in the German 
North Sea, where it will be part of the DolWin6 grid-
connection system. The 900 MW connection will supply 
more than one million households with green wind power 
from the German North Sea.
• DolWin5: given that construction of the platform at the 
Singapore shipyard is currently behind schedule, due to 
previous restrictions related to the COVID-19, several 
acceleration measures were agreed with the contractor 
in 2022.
• BorWin5: the construction of the platform, land station 
and land-cable route was started. Energisation is 
planned to take place in 2025. 
• Borwin6: TenneT awarded contracts for the construction 
and installation of the converter stations at sea and land, 
as well as for cable production and laying. Energisation is 
planned to take place in 2027.
Offshore targets 2022-2030
The European Union has an ambitious strategy for 
offshore wind energy. This is reflected in the targets 
at the national level: for 2030, Germany has a target
of 30 GW of offshore wind capacity, while the 
Netherlands is aiming for 21 GW around 2030. 
TenneT will provide an important contribution to 
these targets with the offshore grid connection for 
40 GW: approximately 20 GW in the German part 
of the North Sea and 20 GW in the Dutch part*. 
This means a strong growth of TenneT’s offshore 
connection capacity by 2030, compared to 2022. 
TenneT has developed a new 2GW standard to 
enable this acceleration. The 2GW Program has a 
strong focus on harmonisation and standardisation. 
It provides a blueprint for future offshore grid 
connection systems and enables faster deployment 
while also reducing the number of grid connections. 
The standardization allows framework contracts with 
the supply chain for multiple connections to ensure 
maximum planning security.
*   1GW of older offshore wind farms in the Netherlands use a private 
connection to the onshore grid.

What could prevent us from realising our goals?
To get to where we need to be, a range of decisions must 
be made: from standards on manufacturing, leaner 
permitting procedures, integrated energy system planning 
(for example hydrogen) to closer co-operation with large 
customers, and other TSOs and DSOs. This requires 
appropriate European and national legislation and 
regulations, and an investment framework that enables us 
to meet the needs and objectives of society, the economy 
and politics.
For the coming years TenneT faces a very high to critical 
risk impacting project delivery in the Netherlands. The 
Council of State in the Netherlands repealed the 
'construction exemption'; the exemption for nitrogen 
deposition caused by construction activities. Because of 
this decision, TenneT is required to calculate for each 
construction and operation phase how it affects the nitrogen 
emissions. This has an immediate effect and ultimately 
affects TenneT's projects, either in delivery or preparation 
delays. On short term, it is expected that around 25 projects 
could be delayed by 1 to 2 years. On the longer term, 
around 100 projects could be delayed by 6 to 12 months. 
Due to the Council of State decision, TenneT could face the 
critical risk of standstill of the Dutch portfolio if no adequate 
and structural solution is found. 
If the projects are not delivered according to our schedule, 
there will be a domino effect of delays in other sectors such 
as industry and residential construction. This is because 
these sectors need grid connections to complete their 
construction and sustainability projects. This puts us in a 
vicious circle: to reduce nitrogen, for instance, sectors need 
to become more sustainable. This requires the electricity 
grid to be extended, but those projects experience major 
delays because they do not get the necessary permits 
because of the nitrogen impasse. On the short term, TenneT 
is seeking acceptance of environmental assessments by 
competent authorities, to proceed as soon as possible with 
the required permits. For the longer run, we need the 
support of the respective governments to ensure that grid 
operators can take this role as a catalyst for sustainable 
development and prioritise when allocating nitrogen 
deposition. In addition, apart from the solutions above that 
the government can implement, TenneT itself is also taking 
action to avoid delays. For instance, TenneT is committed to 
measures to minimise nitrogen emissions during the 
construction phase by using emission-free construction 
equipment.
A continuing risk is the slow licensing and permitting 
procedure directly delaying our planning and building 
progress. Limited space is available to build and expand our 
grid in the natural landscape. In the current political and 
regulatory climate, most of the time spent on a critical 
infrastructure project is on planning and licensing. It often 
takes eight years to achieve the necessary permitting for a 
project that takes two years to construct. If we can only 
move at this speed, the projects needed to achieve the 
targets of 2030, even 2040, are already running against a 
tight deadline. Hence the importance of reducing the 
permitting time. As a result, new laws have been introduced 
by the Dutch and German governments to effectively 
reduce the permitting time.
The effect of extreme weather conditions is mitigated during 
the design, construction and maintenance of our assets, for 
example in the choice of location and materials used. 
Furthermore, TenneT insures all substations and buildings 
during construction and operation against risks from natural 
catastrophes.
As with the scarcity of talent, we also face more competition 
in the next decade in hiring the right skills and 
competences, sourcing the essential products, materials 
and suppliers we need to fulfil our projects. Precise 
management and demand planning across our supply 
chain, as well as close relationships with key suppliers, will 
be increasingly critical for delivering our projects on time.
Our progress depends on a close co-operation between 
governments, other TSOs, DSOs, large customers, and key 
suppliers. Only jointly can we develop innovative ways to 
provide reliable, clean and affordable electricity for a 
sustainable future, through initiatives such as the North Sea 
power hub for North-West Europe.

Ensure critical 
infrastructure for 
society
In the Netherlands, we faced an increase of grid 
congestions last year. In North Brabant and Limburg, 
new companies could temporarily not be connected. 
This had a major impact on the region.
 “The absorption stop for wholesale customers in June 2022 
came as a big shock. Of course, we knew there were big 
challenges for the electricity grid to keep up with the energy 
transition. We were already running into this with large wind 
farms and the Moerdijk port and the industrial area. But 
that the full stop that was declared for two entire provinces 
was something we did not see coming. TenneT, Enexis, the 
state and the provinces of Limburg and Noord-Brabant then 
- under the leadership of Ben Voorhorst - developed a good 
approach. Sometimes, apparently, it takes a crisis to solve 
bottlenecks quickly. Above all, let us continue this energetic 
and constructive cooperation in the coming years.”

Create a safe and inspiring workplace
Every day at TenneT, we are working hard to deliver on our purpose – to connect everyone 
with a brighter energy future. It is a purpose that drives each of our employees and 
contributes to create an inspiring and motivating workplace. As a company that powers 
society, we rely on the power of our growing workforce to help us fulfil our societal task to 
provide a secure supply of electricity, while achieving the challenges of the energy transition.
We consider TenneT’s employees to be our most valuable 
asset. Our physical assets on land and at sea are critical 
infrastructure and they are the result of the combined 
efforts, teamwork, and commitment of people across our 
organisation – and others working with us – to achieve our 
strategic goals. At TenneT, our workforce comprises 
primarily of our own employees, the colleagues that work 
for us, which has grown from around 600 when TenneT was 
founded in 1998 to 5,930 employees in 2022. In addition, 
we have many other valued colleagues that are externally 
contracted that help us deliver on our ambitions and ensure 
that we are able to fulfil our promise. In 2022 this amounted 
to 1,467 colleagues, compared to 1,452 last year. Their 
combined efforts ensure that we are able to keep the lights 
on every day and support us in our ambition to drive the 
energy transition. With the increasing ambitions from the 
governments in the areas we serve, we need to grow even 
more to meet them.
In 2025, we anticipate we will need to be operating at peak 
capacity to be able to achieve the European Union’s climate 
targets – a 55% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030. 
To be prepared for this, we are working hard to enable 
accommodating up to 10,000 employees and 
subcontractors in a great and safe place to work and while 
striving for zero harm. To underpin, this is not a target in 
itself, but it is the size of the workforce we want to be able 
to accommodate if necessary for meeting our 2025 
strategic goals.
However, many other players in the energy market are 
gearing up in the same timeframe, and competition for 
talent – especially in technical roles – is intense. We are 
competing in a small, candidate-driven market. As such, we 
have to be smart in our recruiting, and ensure the strategy 
covers being an employer of choice as that is where people 
like to work and stay for a long time. With people at the 
heart of TenneT, and by following a path of responsible 
growth, we are putting ourselves in the best position to 
meet the challenges ahead. This is why our strategic pillar 
‘energise our people and organisation’ is so important.
And we want to be a company where our employees grow 
and feel confident to speak up and be themselves. As part 
of this, we see the advantages of building a diverse and 
inclusive culture, with talents that reflect the communities 
we serve. Through diversity, inclusion, and a safe working 
culture, we aim to create more innovative solutions to drive 
the energy transition.
We are aware that accelerating the scale and pace of our 
work means that additional challenges might occur with 
respect to safety – for our own employees and those of our 
contractors. That is why we need to grow and realise the 
future energy system in a responsible way. We are 
determined to create a safe environment for our people to 
work, where each person returns home safely at the end of  
the day. We are saddened that we were unable to on

In 2022 our workforce grew to 7,397 compared to 6,620 in 
2021. Our workforce is becoming more diverse, with 
70 different nationalities compared to 63 last year, and we 
also see developments in other areas of being an inclusive 
and diverse workforce as a result of our efforts in this field. 
This includes, but is not limited to, areas such as gender 
diversity, as we see the female inflow as a percentage of 
total inflow increasing from 31% last year to 33% this year. 
As regards safety, our efforts in 2022 resulted in a Total 
Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR) of 4.4, compared to a 5.8 
rate in 2021. We are deeply saddened that despite all our 
efforts, we have been unable to prevent the fatal incidents 
that occurred this year. We deeply regret the loss of a young 
employee in May at the TenneT storage warehouse for the 
project Ostbayernring near Wernberg-Köblitz in the district 
of Schwandorf. Another fatality occurred in July, where an 
employee of a contractor was seriously injured during the 
unloading of parts of a temporary powerline portal at a 
construction warehouse in the Emden/ Ost - Conneforde 
grid expansion project.
We also track our absentee rate on a quarterly basis, as a 
measure to track the health of our workforce. In Germany, 
we recorded an absentee rate of 4.1 (2021:2.6) and in the 
Netherlands this was 3.7 (3.1 in 2021). 
At the beginning of this year, many COVID-19 measures 
from the governments in the areas we serve were still in 
effect. Authorities in Germany and the Netherlands scaled 
these measures down in the course of 2022, however the 
effects of the pandemic still impacted the health of our 
people. In 2022, colleagues still caught COVID-19. Some 
unfortunately also suffer from Long-COVID and many other 
infections increased when people met again. At the same 
time, the pressure on our workforce due to absent 
colleagues potentially also affected our people, such as their 
mental health and higher workload as examples of this. This 
underpins the importance of our support program Always 
Energy, and discussions around leadership and how we 
work at TenneT.
Our performance in 2022 
As we regrettably had two fatal incidents 
one employee and one contractor, we 
believe our safety performance is not 
on par. Even though we showed steady 
improvement on our TRIR over the year 
and met our target, we are working hard 
to ensure a safe place to work for all.

Future-proof our organisation by recruiting the 
best talent
As TenneT prepares to accommodate up to 10,000 internal 
and external employees by 2025, recruitment is a strategically 
key success factor for our business.
TenneT has started to use a more competency based 
approach, meaning hiring people for their individual talent 
interests and skills rather than solely for their experience. 
This is a prerequisite for TenneT's recruiting and 
development. The candidate availability in a tight market 
requires us to be develop our recruitment approach and 
move away from traditional working practices. 
To further identify and interest talents in TenneT we intend to 
engage with them early in their career and ideally stay in 
touch through our talent pools. To this end, education, and 
partnerships with academic institutions play an important 
role in our recruitment efforts (see ‘Solve societal challenges 
with stakeholders and through partnerships’). Examples of 
this includes internships, the apprenticeships we have in 
Germany and also introducing them to our work in their 
studies such as with the Power Minor which we have been 
working together with the universities of applied sciences of 
The Hague, Amsterdam and of Arnhem and Nijmegen. 
Safety
 
Ensuring a safe working environment for the people 
working for and with us, is a key prerequisite in our 
work, every day. It is the foundation for everything we 
do for our workforce as none of this matters if they 
do not return home safely. We are keenly aware of 
the risks associated with our activities. Safety has 
multiple aspects, in the physical sense as well as from 
a psychological sense. From a physical sense, working 
at height with high-voltage assets and with heavy lifting 
equipment and materials, onshore as well as offshore, is 
a key risk. Our aim regarding safety at TenneT is simple: 
we want all people working for TenneT to come home 
safe every day and aim for zero harm in the workplace.
The pursuit of zero harm is reflected in many areas, 
with our own employees, with our contractors, in our 
operations in the field and in our offices. It is something 
everyone at TenneT has a responsibility for. 
As our organisation grows, so does our exposure to 
risk. As we expand our grid at multiple disconnected 
sites, we have to mitigate the risks of large 
construction sites and consider the safety standards 
of multiple subcontractors and their teams. Scarcity of 
human resources further adds to the safety complexity, 
with fewer highly experienced workers available, and 
safety training and standards harder to oversee and 
control across our expansive supply chain.
These added complexities underpin the importance of 
why safety is of the highest priority to us. 
As such, we focus on building stricter and simpler 
processes and principles for behaviours at TenneT to 
support our safety ambition of zero harm. We have 
updated our Life-Saving Rules (LSRs) and put more 
emphasis on the application of the 'Fair Approach'. 
The Fair Approach means that anyone who sees 
someone breaking a LSR reaches out to the person 
who broke the rule. The aim is to find out why he/
she broke the LSR in order to learn from it and define 
organisational measures to prevent similar breaches 
in future. Furthermore, we have been working on 
strengthening our safety strategy and safety 
performance with the introduction of a new Safety 
Roadmap 2025. The Roadmap shows how we aim to 
embed safety further into our ways of working, into our 
leadership performance management, and in how we 
work with our supply chain partners.
An example of the safety actions included in the new 
roadmap include our Safety Leadership Programme, 
with the motto ‘Safety needs our Energy’, to enhance 
a proactive safety culture within TenneT. This provides 
a behavioural guidance on how to develop a positive 
and stimulating environment in which all our employees 
and partners can work safely. This is supported 
with a programme to make it an integral part of our 
leadership, behaviour and processes. Our company’s 
leaders were trained on this in a two-day training.

Attracting talent is just one part of the equation. Ensuring 
people feel energised and are motivated to be part of our 
company is equally important. A good balance between 
on-the-job training and developmental opportunities are 
needed to grow individual talent, as well as creating a 
workplace where people feel energised, like to work, are 
inspired and are connected to us as a company. That is why 
we provide our colleagues the opportunity to invest in 
themselves. An example of this is our TenneT Academy, 
which supports our colleagues find and select courses to 
help them in their careers. 
Bring out the best in our people in an inclusive 
and safe environment
To ensure our workforce feels energised and that they are 
able to contribute every day, we aim to create a work 
environment that is safe and inclusive. We have described 
our views and policies on safety in a physical sense, but 
creating a workplace where our workforce feels safe in a 
non-physical manner is another important aspect of safety, 
such as social safety and mental health. This means not 
only paying attention to physical safety, where the biggest 
impacts are at our project sites, but also in our offices. For 
everyone at TenneT, we want to create a safe working 
environment, also in a broader sense. Feeling accepted and 
encouraged to speak up is an important part of the success 
of TenneT. So step by step we are working on building an 
inclusive and safe environment. It is of great importance for 
the success of TenneT that people feel they can speak 
freely without fear of negative consequences and build a 
culture of openness and mutual respect with no 
discrimination. 
Inclusion & Diversity
At TenneT we appreciate difference, it is a prerequisite for 
solving the energy transition. So no matter where you are 
from or who you are we want you to feel welcome and 
accepted at TenneT. This is particularly visible in our 
International Trainee group, just to mention one example. 
This traineeship welcomes participants from both the 
Netherlands and Germany, as well as other countries, with 
different educational backgrounds and through assignments 
in several units within the company they start their careers 
at TenneT. 
Therefore we are embedding I&D in every step of our 
employee journey. It requires long time efforts as 
unconscious and conscious biases are normal and need 
attention to take good decisions in recruiting, promoting 
and developing our employees. This is a constant learning 
process, where our employees are the most important 
input givers. 
We are seeing the results of our efforts with an increasingly 
international employee base. In 2022, we have 70 different 
nationalities represented among our diverse employee 
population and 9.1% of our new hires were not of either 
Dutch or German nationality. This is a great success as tax 
laws currently do not foster this. We have to hire our 
international employees on either a Dutch or a German 
contract to make it work.
As part of our work to promote inclusion and diversity at 
TenneT in 2022, we held Disability Days in Germany in 
October at Lehrte and Bayreuth. In October we celebrated 
National Coming Out Day 2022 through our social media 
channels, showing our support for the LGBTQIA+ 
community. We are also promoting inclusion and diversity 
by working together with other organisations, such as the 
Refugee Talent Hub. More on this can be found in the 
‘Solve societal challenges with stakeholders and through 
partnerships’ chapter.
Gender equity
We strive for equal pay for equal work. This is why in 2021, 
TenneT began its first investigation into a gender salary gap. 
The first results of this assessment indicate that a gender 
salary gap might exist in both the Netherlands and in 
Germany. Data limitations and historical factors create

challenges for us to exactly determine all factors that have 
led to this situation, but we are taking measures to address, 
close and prevent gender pay gaps where they occur. This 
will be a continued focus, particularly as creating a level 
playing field for comparisons is almost impossible. When 
hiring, it is a focus area and particular attention is given for 
part time and paternity gaps as they are the source for 
different development of salaries.
We have followed up on a 2021 survey leading to several 
initiatives to strengthen a women-friendly workplace at all 
times. We implemented a reporting system to monitor equal 
application of rewards, benefits and career opportunities. 
We have invested to secure female safety gear (Personal 
Safety Equipment) and we have embedded an improved 
reporting channel for unequal treatment including sexism 
and harassment.
In addition, we are working to encourage more young 
women to pursue careers at TenneT. For example, we held 
an open day for school students called Girls Day in April 
2022, in which over 6,000 young women participated.
Organise for our people to perform at their best 
and to work as one company
Since 2018, our organisation has been on our Transforming 
TenneT journey, designed to re-calibrate our business for 
growth. Today, given the scale of the challenges in the 
energy transition and accelerated climate ambitions, we are 
strengthening our working practices such as increased 
focus on performance management. We have set clear 
transformation priorities to drive our performance and help 
us further accelerate.
To meet our end goals, we are making choices as we are 
not able to address all challenges at once. To move faster 
and simplify, we are also adopting smarter ways of working 
and how we can organise ourselves, such as collaborating 
more with other stakeholders, i.e. with partners in our 
supply chain. The new long-term framework agreements 
with suppliers in the offshore 2GW Program are an 
example of this approach (see ‘Solve societal challenges 
with stakeholders and through partnerships’). This is how 
we are able to organise ourselves for growth within a 
running business.
To increase our delivery speed, we also enhanced our 
internal new ways of working with respect to performance 
management, which has been rolled out across the 
company. The aim is to provide a standardised approach for 
performance management that can scale with our growth. 
Regular discussion with employees around results, and 
addressing obstacles in their path, stimulates the 
development of our employees individually and collectively.
What could prevent us from reaching our goals?
As our organisation grows, so does our exposure to certain 
risks. We are under increasing pressure to deliver a 
fast-expanding portfolio of projects across a wide variety of 
onshore and offshore locations. This creates pressure on 
adhering to legal obligations, our Code of Conduct, as well 
as pressure to attract the right competences and talent on 
time. In addition, this also relates to adhering to health and 
safety rules, where it is essential that TenneT addresses the 
increased risk for safety incidents, or major accidents, if 
more deliverables are required in our fast-expanding 
portfolio in the same timeframe and with the same 
staffing. This creates pressure on adhering to legal 
obligations, our Code of Conduct, health and safety rules.
This involves both our own employees and our contractors. 
A situation of intentionally or unintentionally balancing safety 
requirements versus on-time project delivery is not an 
acceptable risk. To address this, we need to adapt our 
safety practices to the work we do and embed a top-to-
bottom safety culture that is consistent across all our units 
and through our supply chain. Hence education is to train all 
stakeholders, without distinction between internal 
employees and contractors, about the importance and 
adherence to all safety regulations whether working at a 
construction site or at the office. Due to the unfortunate 
safety incidents in 2022, it has become ever more important 
for us to ensure that all contractors and subcontractors 
adhere to our high standard safety rules, without exception. 
As a result, we increasingly build safety requirements into 
our tenders, thereby cementing it into the beginning of our 
relationships with suppliers and making it a pre-condition of 
doing business with TenneT.
Hiring and retaining new talent for the coming years is 
essential if TenneT is to deliver on its promises to support 
2030 climate targets. A foreseen and growing risk is the 
unavailability of the right talent for the coming three years. 
Many other organisations in the value chain are gearing up 
for the same climate targets, and competition for talent – 
especially in technical roles – is intense. This leads to the 
widespread limited availability of specialist skills and an 
overheated job-market. Since applicants no longer only 
consider primary benefits but give more weight to internal 
succession and chances of progressing in their careers, 
TenneT needs to continuously stress its image as an 
attractive employer. This is essential not only for new hires, 
but also to retain current employees.

One way to address the increasing hiring risk is to have a 
competency-based approach, hiring people based more on 
their individual talents, interests and skills as opposed to a 
requirement for specific experiences. In this way, we can 
proactively identify talents we want to work with and then 
match them to roles, as opposed to reactively waiting for 
vacancies that we then need to fill. However, we need to 
ensure we have simplified and standardised processes that 
can be scaled efficiently across the organisation without 
over-burdening our people and inhibiting our ability to 
deliver against our challenging targets.
As regards improving safety practices among our 
contractors, we take a two-pronged approach. On one 
hand, we increasingly build safety requirements into our 
tenders, thereby embedding safety into the beginning of our 
relationships with contractors and making it a condition of 
doing business with TenneT. On the other hand, we work 
together with contractors to ensure that they have a firm 
understanding and application of our safety standards, by 
holding safety-focused meetings with our contractors’ 
leaders and also participating in site visits, where we jointly 
observe work in action and collaborate on practical safety 
improvements. In addition, we work with our contractors to 
have them certified on safety via the Safety Culture Ladder 
(SCL), a Dutch standard for assessing safety culture within 
organisations. SCL indicates the maturity of a company in 
the field of safety awareness, attitude and behaviour. As 
part of the SCL programme, the aim is for all companies 
working for TenneT that carry out high- and medium-risk 
contracts to be SCL-certified. We are proud to state that 
per year-end 2022 almost 92% of our order volume relates 
to contractors that were certified or were in the process of 
getting certified. We also continued to measure our own 
safety culture using the SCL. As part of the continuous 
improvement process, certification to level 4 (out of 5) of the 
SCL is included in TenneT’s new Safety Strategy. The first 
parts of TenneT are now certified on level 4 such as Large 
Projects Netherlands - Area North. Several other units have 
started initiatives to become certified in 2023.
Furthermore, we have updated our LSRs in 2022. The 
previous LSRs have been evaluated by our SHE (Safety, 
Health and Environment) teams and their scope broadened, 
like the LSR on safe hoisting. We sharpened them to further 
strengthen our day-today safety practices. We aimed to 
make them even clearer and adding two additional LSRs to 
include safe driving and another on ‘line of fire’ (staying clear 
from the movement of a hazardous object or the release of 
hazardous energy, such as hot air or fire). A violation of the 
LSRs provides us with an opportunity to learn. We therefore 
expect a discussion to follow up on each incident of 
non-compliance and we ensure that the incident and the 
circumstances are reported in our incident reporting system. 
Reporting also enables us to map out the proposed action 
and monitor progress. If further non-compliance occurs, 
disciplinary action is taken.

The energy transition involves a large amount of work. TenneT 
will grow signifcantly in the coming years. Finding colleagues is 
a tough challenge, taking place far beyond the Netherlands and 
Germany.
“I am originally from Mashhad in Iran and came to Germany nearly four 
years ago with my family, my lovely six-year-old son and my husband.
With a background in physics – my PhD from Bayreuth University is 
in the physics of soft matter – I was keen on working for a company 
which not only has environmental concerns but also matches my 
background, which TenneT was the great option for my goal. As a 
physicist one knows a bit about most felds, which could be really 
useful at TenneT, where some background in electrical engineering is 
helpful. There is a lot of respect for different cultures in the company, 
which is really important. Choosing to live in Germany was a really 
huge step for me. I was taking my PhD and looking after my son, and 
meanwhile I was learning German! 
In this point of my life, I am very happy that I joined TenneT, as it is 
a safe place where people value and respect each other. Right now, 
I am a trainee in the Large Projects Germany team. I am learning 
how to write technical project concepts, for substations for instance. 
I am quite busy day-to-day, so time management can be challenging. 
As a trainee you do not just focus on daily tasks, you also take part in 
trainee events, attend workshops, and help organising a few events. 
In addition, you are of course building your own network and involved 
in non-stop learning.”

Create value to transition to a climate-neutral economy
As a European TSO, TenneT creates value for society by driving the energy transition and 
delivering a future-proof electricity grid. By playing our part, we contribute to the EU’s 
ambitions to be a climate-neutral continent by 2050. We contribute to this through our 
assets, knowledge and innovations to build a reliable and affordable future-proof grid that 
supports society’s net zero ambitions.
As we expand and reinforce our grid to facilitate the energy 
transition, we are conscious that we also have a negative 
impact on the natural world around us. Procuring and 
producing the materials needed to build our assets on 
land and at sea has an impact on nature, greenhouse gas 
emissions, pollution and resource scarcity. And as the 
energy transition is a global challenge involving a wide 
array of other parties from the energy sector and associated 
supply chain, our sector’s demand on resources and impact 
on nature is growing all the time.
Therefore, as well as contributing to societal objectives by 
driving the energy transition, TenneT can create additional 
value by leading as a green and responsible grid operator. 
Through our nature, climate and circularity ambitions, we 
aim to shape what we believe is necessary for a responsible 
growth path. With these ambitions, we can take ownership 
for our impact and show leadership. 
We report our progress in each of these key areas, with 
targets set for 2025 regarding climate neutrality, net zero 
impact on nature, and circularity. In addition to measuring 
our performance against these targets, we report on our 
progress in contributing to a climate-neutral economy by 
disclosing the equivalent number of households that can, in 
theory, receive 100% renewable electricity as a result of our 
renewable energy-grid investments. This is one of our key 
metrics to measure our societal impact (refer to 'Societal 
impact we enable by driving the energy transition’ below).

Though our net carbon foot-

grid losses, we are focusing 
on strategies for reduction of 
our indirect emissions through 
our supply chain and SF6

Climate
We contribute to the transition to a climate-neutral society 
by connecting more renewables to the grid. And as a 
responsible grid operator, we also strive to make a green 
transition in our own operations by reducing our carbon 
footprint. In line with Science Based Targets that align with 
the goals of the Paris Agreement, we have set ambitious 
emission-reduction goals for 2030, aiming to cut our direct 
emissions in scope 1 and 2 by 95% and our indirect 
emissions (scope 3) from purchased goods and services 
and capital goods in our supply chain by 30%. These 
targets are an extension of our 2025 climate-reduction 
targets. The majority of scope 1 and 2 emissions are from 
grid losses – the electricity lost during transmission across 
our network – and from emissions from the insulating gas 
SF6, energy use from our offices, at our stations, and the 
mobility of our employees. Scope 3 emissions are more 
challenging to measure, as they are the indirect emissions 
that arise in our supply chain, as a result of what we 
purchase and contract.
Scope 1 (Direct own emissions)
SF6 gas
For our transmission services, TenneT needs specialist 
insulating and fire-extinguishing protection for high-voltage 
stations and distribution systems. Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) 
is widely used by TSOs as a highly effective insulator and 
extinguisher in switching installations. But it is also a 
greenhouse gas, with one unit equivalent to over 23,500 
units of CO2. If the gas leaks, during installation, 
maintenance, or due to faulty equipment, it is extremely 
damaging for the environment. While SF6 leakages currently 
only account for around 1% of our carbon footprint, we still 
aim to mitigate its impact as much as possible. We are 
working to find sustainable alternatives to SF6 that provide 
similar safety properties without harmful emissions. We aim 
for two-thirds of our assets to be SF6-free in 2030.
During 2022 we made significant progress in this regard, 
with new pilots to explore SF6-free installations in the 
Netherlands and Germany. In the Netherlands, for a grid 
expansion project at the high-voltage substation 
Maasbracht 380 kV, for example, we challenged suppliers 
to propose SF6-free solutions for gas-insulated lines and 
gas-insulated switchgear. We used an internal carbon price 
of EUR 100 /tonne CO2 in the project tender to stimulate 
alternative solutions for SF6.
To reach our SF6 reduction goal, it is important to perform 
early testing of SF6-free equipment. In 2022, we awarded 
the first contract for a fully SF6-free 420 kV gas-insulated 
switchgear (GIS) for the TenneT grid in Erzhausen. 
The contract for this project was signed at the end of 2022. 
This is the first time we have taken this step, which we 
expect will stimulate the market to find commercial and 
technically effective alternatives to SF6. We notice that the 
potential to collaborate with suppliers on such solutions 
(also see ‘Solve societal challenges with stakeholders and 
through partnerships’) is easier for 220 kV and 380 kV 
assets as this allows suppliers to develop scalable solutions 
for the wider European and international market. For smaller 
installations of 150 kV, it is harder to find suppliers to 
engage in solutions focused only on one market. 
Nevertheless, we are holding dedicated supplier sessions to 
explain our strategy and why we are determined to steer 
away from using insulating gas with such high global 
warming potential.

Mobility
The mobility of our employees, whether travelling to and

emissions and is an area we are addressing with carbon-
reducing policies. For example, we aim for a fully electric 
lease car fleet by 2025, replacing the current use of hybrids.

In 2022, we also developed a TenneT Mobility Vision, 
including a partnership with the German rail operator 
Deutsche Bahn that encourages employees to travel by 
train for carbon-neutral journeys. As part of this drive 
towards more carbon-neutral travel, TenneT has 
implemented a bike-leasing scheme for our employees in 
the Netherlands and Germany.
Gas consumption
Gas usage for heating our offices and stations is also part of 
our scope 1 emissions. To reduce the impact of gas 
consumption on our carbon footprint, we purchase green 
gas for all offices and stations in the Netherlands and in 
Germany. 
Scope 2 (indirect upstream)
Grid losses
Around 95% of TenneT’s CO2 footprint is due to grid losses 
– the loss of electricity that inevitably occurs during power 
transmission across our network. The grid losses are 
measured as the difference between the electricity fed into 
the grid and the electricity delivered. Grid losses depend, 
among other things, on the current, voltage and the 
distance that electricity is transmitted. Unfortunately, as we 
expand our network to support the energy transition our 
grid losses might grow proportionally higher.
Although we cannot prevent grid losses from occurring, we 
aim to reduce their climate impact. To this end, we green 
our grid losses by using guarantees of origin (GoO's) from 
renewable sources. In previous years, we have been able to 
green for 100% of grid losses in the Netherlands and 55% 
of grid losses in Germany. We are currently limited by 
German regulation in purchasing guarantees of origin, which 
is why we procure GoO’s corresponding to our equivalent 
German grid losses on group level.
In 2022, the energy crisis and resulting energy price volatility 
also had an impact on the prices of the GoO's. If we were 
to stick to greening 55% of our grid losses in Germany, 
costs could have increased by tenfold in 2022 compared to 
2021. As the German legislation does not support 
procurement nor reimbursement of GoO's, we decided to 
green the German grid losses until a monetary limit. 
Although we have increased our spend in GoO's, this 
cannot keep pace with the increasing price of GoO's. As a 
result, we greened 9% of German grid losses. Though this 
leads to an increase in our net carbon footprint, we have to 
balance our climate goals with our financial health. We are 
in continuous dialogue with our regulator, the legislator and 
the other TSOs to find a way to reduce the carbon footprint 
of TSO and DSO grid losses in Germany.
Electricity use in stations and offices
Similar to gas usage, the electricity use in our offices and 
substations has an impact on our carbon footprint which we 
mitigate by purchasing green electricity. For our substations, 
we strive to decrease the carbon footprint by using solar 
panels, insulation measures and LED lighting where 
possible. We have installed solar panels on our land stations 
at Hollandse Kust Noord and will use the generated 
electricity for our own consumption.
Societal impact we enable by driving the energy transition
 
The largest impact that TenneT has in terms of 
climate action is to enable the switch from a fossil 
fuel-driven economy to a climate-neutral economy by 
connecting renewable energy sources and transmitting 
the produced electricity. We define our key impact 
metric in this area as the equivalent number of 
households that in theory would have been able to 
receive 100% green electricity. It is important to realise 
that the majority of the electricity consumption comes 
from industry. We estimate that by the end of 2022 we 
have enabled the theoretical equivalent of more than 
14 million households to receive green electricity. 
 
These climate figures are not just achieved by our 
own operations, but also by our partners in the value 
chain, such as electricity generation companies and 
distribution system operators (DSOs). By working 
together, we avoided 17.2 million tons of CO2 
equivalents in 2022. More information on these impact 
metrics (such as the methodology) is included in our 
additional CSR data document.

Scope 3 (Indirect, supply chain)
In 2021, we committed to the Science-Based Targets 
initiative and revised our climate targets, aligning them to 
the 2015 Paris Agreement. This includes an ambitious 
target to reduce our scope 3 emissions from purchased 
goods and services and capital goods by 30% in 2030. 
Achieving this target requires extensive engagement and a 
collective outlook among our suppliers on how we can 
collaborate to reduce emissions from the products and 
services we buy. Gathering enough quality data relating to 
our supply chain is key to making progress. To this end, 
during 2022, we executed an analysis on our future demand 
for the next decade and identified asset categories that 
contribute to a significant portion of our scope 3 emissions. 
By identifying our demand of different assets over the next 
8 to 10 years and assessing the scope 3 emissions related 
with every type of asset, we aim to identify those 
procurement categories that are the most carbon intensive 
and have the highest potential for emission reduction. 
Based on this analysis we can set the right focus in 
integrating sustainability into the sourcing strategies of all 
our procurement categories.
With transformers, overhead lines and cables we identified 
pilot procurement categories to start with. With those 
assets we are already integrating sustainability in the 
sourcing strategies as well as in supplier relations and our 
tenders. Understanding emission hotspots and highest 
emission reduction potential per asset through Life Cycle 
Assessments (LCA) plays an integral part in this integration. 
This not only already creates first impact on scope 3 
emission reduction, but also helps us gain valuable 
experience for the remaining procurement categories in our 
portfolio.
We are increasingly taking a holistic view on sustainability in 
our supply chain. Next to LCAs, we use tools such as the 
Environmental Cost Indicator (ECI) to incentivise our 
suppliers to reduce the environmental impact of the 
products and services we buy from them. By giving the 
environmental saving a monetary value through the ECI, we 
can gather more data on our environmental impacts. This 
approach also means suppliers are encouraged to provide 
more transparency on their product lifecycle emissions in 
our tendering process.
TenneT’s sustainable Revolving Credit Facility: linking 
climate performance to finance
To make progress against our climate ambitions even 
more visible, we have linked our financing costs to our 
climate performance. Secure access to finance is essential 
to ensure that we maintain the pace of our investment 
portfolio. An example of this is our EUR 3.6 billion 
sustainable Revolving Credit Facility (RCF), which is linked 
to sustainability performance indicators and targets. 
In practice this means that, depending on the realisation 
of our climate-related KPIs, a discount is applied to the 
interest margin of the RCF. This is related to the green 
percentage of energy use of our stations (100% in 2022 
vs 100% in 2021) and our offices (100% in 2022 vs 100% 
in 2021). It is also linked to the net carbon impact of mobility 
per employee against the total number of employees (1.4 in 
2022 compared to 1.2 in 2021) and the net carbon footprint 
of leaked SF6 gas divided by theoretical CO2 impact of 
banked SF6 (0.15% in 2022 compared to 0.22% in 
2021). To reduce our CO2 footprint, we compensated for a 
part of our leaked SF6 through carbon offsets for generating 
renewable energy in Turkey.
Nature
As our assets are located on land and at sea, we have an 
inevitable impact on nature. We do our best to limit our 
negative impact, especially in vulnerable nature areas, 
and where possible to have a positive impact by using 
environmentally friendly and innovative techniques. Our goal 
is to reduce our net impact on nature to zero.
Our policies (such as our code of conduct) set out how we 
should carry out our maintenance and construction work, in 
accordance with nature conservation laws. As part of this, 
we carefully track the number of environmental incidents – 
such as leakages of SF6 gas, oil leakages from our assets, 
and other occurrences that have a negative impact on 
nature. In 2022, we recorded 2,866 litres (of which 364 litres 
related to 2021) of oil leaked from our cables, in comparison 
to 1,798 litres of oil in 2021. Unlike our newer onshore and 
offshore assets, cables from older parts of the onshore grid, 
especially in the Netherlands, are more prone to leak oil. 
An example of this relates to the connection Waalhaven - 
Oudeland, where a significant part of our 2022 leakages 
relate to. We regret these instances were oil was leaked and 
always monitor our assets closely to learn from the root 
causes and take appropriate measures to prevent leakage 
or mitigate the impact of the leakage. In addition to the oil 
leakages, we record incidents where we have a negative 
impact on the environment, soil, air or water. In 2022 we 
recorded 101 environmental incidents in 2022, in 
comparison to 81 incidents in 2021.

In 2022, we looked into improving our measurements of 
net zero impact on nature. Along with students from the 
Wageningen University & Research, a roadmap with Key 
Performance Indicators for positive nature measures was 
developed. This will help us improve our performance 
measurement with regards to positive nature measures. 
We also include details on nature commitments in our 
investment plans. For each proposed investment, a 
‘Commitment to Nature’ paragraph details a description of 
the anticipated impact on nature, and measures to mitigate. 
In 2022, 100% of our G2 documents included a 
‘Commitment to Nature’ paragraph.
In our commitment to have zero impact on nature, we aim 
to create a positive impact where possible. The visual above 
includes some of the nature measures that were 
implemented in 2022.

Highlights on our high voltage stations 
In recent years, we have placed more emphasis on 
improving biodiversity at the sites of our high-voltage 
substations. In 2022, we continued to do this through our 
own initiatives and in collaboration with external partners, 
including but not limited to:
• In Zevenhuizen, we worked on creating additional 
ecological value through a nature-inclusive design. 
This includes installing bird boxes and bee hotels to 
improve biodiversity and using herb-rich grassland 
where possible.
• After successful pilots in 2020 and 2021, we increased 
our use of sinus mowing at substations, to improve 
insect habitats. Using grass at substations supports 
40% more insects than sedum or gravel. A pilot study 
using robotic mowing is underway at Meeden station 
and the lessons learned from this will be used to evaluate 
scalability to other stations.
• During the replacement and extension of a substation in 
Isar, TenneT built new habitation areas for the fence lizard. 
Highlights on our cable and line connections
In 2022 we stepped up our work to promote biodiversity 
measures around our pylons, such as planting flowers and 
trees and protecting bird life. Our negative impacts in this 
area relate mainly to bird collisions with our high-voltage 
lines. To minimise this impact, we determine high-risk spots 
and implement bird-barrier measures. We also implement 
positive nature measures by including nature-inclusive 
design or applying our ‘Commitment to Nature’ in each 
project.
• With the Step Stone Pylon Programme, we are 
investigating how sowing certain herbaceous mixtures 
can boost biodiversity around high-voltage pylons, 
making them ‘step stones’ in the landscape for insects 
and birds.
• For the Stade-Landesbergen connection in Germany, 
we are planting new trees next to the Stade substation, 
hanging bat caves in trees along the route, and 
measures to protect the habitats of skylarks.
Highlights offshore
In our work to extend our offshore grid, we aim to follow 
a strategy of ‘nature inclusive design’. This includes 
conducting ecological monitoring to identify where we can 
have a positive impact, such as installing fish hotels around 
our platforms and preventing damage to maritime life from 
electromagnetic fields.
• In July 2022, we conducted a first monitoring campaign 
of the use of eco-friendly cable crossings at Hollandse 
Kust (Zuid) Alpha with Waardenburg Ecology. These 
replace the layer that is usually made of granite with 
calcareous rocks, which provides a safe breeding space 
for fish. The development of habitats around these 
eco-crossings will be studied for three successive years. 
• Also in July 2022, we conducted a pilot with Dutch Sail 
and Wageningen Marine Research, where sailing crews 
collect video images and water samples for analysis. 
• In late 2022 we monitored fish hotels installed at 
Hollandse Kust (Noord) and installed artificial reefs, reef 
balls and Arc Marine Reef Cubes.
• At Borssele Alpha, we conduct electromagnetic field 
monitoring, using a continuous monitoring station to gain 
insights into the effects of electromagnetic fields on the 
marine environment. Magnetic fields, caused by 
electricity cables under the seabed, can be detected by 
marine organisms, such as fish, and affect their 
behaviour. By assessing the effect of our cables, we can 
take appropriate measures to reduce negative impact.
Circularity
To realise our projects and drive the energy transition it is 
necessary to use raw materials and components that are 
naturally scarce, in short supply or difficult or even 
impossible to recycle. These challenges become more 
severe as competition for resources intensifies across the 
global energy sector. The scale of work required across the 
energy transition is immense, but resources are limited. This 
is not only due to the natural scarcity of critical materials 
such as copper, but also due to the logistical supply-chain 
challenges experienced in 2022, following the war in 
Ukraine and COVID-19 lockdowns in China. This impacted 
the availability and price volatility of key commodities, such 
as copper, steel and aluminium.
As we expand our grid with material-intensive assets such 
as cables, transformers, substations, steel pylons and 
overhead lines, the competition for raw materials intensifies. 
As such, all players in the energy industry need to think of 
how they can achieve their energy transition goals, by using 
fewer materials as possible, increasing circularity, and 
minimising waste.

Demand for limited resources is particularly important to 
consider when it comes to the extraction of naturally 
scarce raw materials that are critical to our assets – such 
as mineral oil, used in transformers, and copper. Global 
demand for virgin copper is not easily met by supply. 
There are some alternatives to copper in electricity cabling 
– such as aluminium – but we have to carefully balance the 
consequences of doing so. Aluminium may not be a 
scarce natural resource, but its production has a heavy 
environmental impact and its use in cables results in 
higher grid losses. 
To reduce the environmental impact of our materials, we are 
adapting our tenders to include stricter circularity 
requirements, for example by asking suppliers to provide 
evidence of the percentage of their materials that are 
recyclable and recycled with ‘raw material passports’. 
Requirements such as this are being increasingly applied 
through our supply chain, either as requirements within 
tenders, or as incentives in our procurement. 
On the basis of our raw material passports, we are working 
on improving our insight into our impact on virgin copper. In 
2022, we further improved our insights by conducting 
base-case life cycle assessments on those assets where we 
make most use of copper (cables, transformers and shunt 
reactors), and have gained a better picture of our overall 
copper usage. While the assessment is still largely based on 
estimations and our insights into the recycling rates of our 
purchased assets are still limited to a restricted number of 
raw material passports, our analysis indicates that in 2022 
around 38% of our purchased copper was recycled. We 
believe that when the full analysis is completed, it will 
indicate that the percentage of recycled copper will range 
from 25-40% of our total copper purchases.
A major milestone in our journey to reduce our impact on 
virgin copper has been made in 2022 by implementing the 
Environmental Cost Indicator (ECI) in our tenders for new 
corporate framework agreements for purchasing AC 
Cables, Power Transformers and Shunt Reactors. This will 
not only give us exact insights in the amount and sourcing 
of copper in these assets and their environmental impact, 
but also directly incentivise our suppliers to increase 
recycling rates in their products.
To understand the long-term impact of raw material scarcity 
on our business and how we can mitigate its effects, we are 
currently developing a strategic perspective on raw material 
scarcity. In particular, we are looking at the strategic 
imperatives of attracting and securing supplies of scarce 
raw materials and reducing our dependency on them 
through enhanced circularity. The result will be a new policy 
that we can use to evaluate our current status and provide 
the business with concrete guidance.
For waste, we are also working on improving our insights 
into the amount and types of waste we produce. This year's 
analysis includes insights for our offices, onshore and 
offshore operations, and onshore projects. We were able to 
improve our insights into Dutch projects by improving the 
data flow from the project contractors. While the analysis 
includes actual waste reports and waste data, a major part 
is still based on assumptions and extrapolations. The results 
of this year's assessment show that around 14% of our 
waste is non-recyclable. We believe that, when we have 
completed the full analysis, this aligns with our 
understanding that 10-25% of our waste is non-recyclable.
The analysis also shows that we are continuously facing 
challenges in the flow of our waste data. For this reason, in 
2022 we have laid the foundation for a complete makeover 
of our corporate waste reporting processes. In view of the 
expanding requirements imposed by the Corporate 
Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), we have started 
to further improve our internal waste reporting processes 
throughout the different parts of the organisation and to 
define clear definitions, requirements and processes for 
waste reporting. In our German onshore operations and 
projects we are also investigating possibilities to further 
digitalise waste management and reporting, which could 
ultimately serve as a blueprint for expansion to the rest of 
the organization. We expect that these improvements will 
bring waste reporting and management to a new level, which 
will ultimately enable us to steer on the reduction of non-
recyclable waste in a much more effective and targeted way.
What could prevent us from reaching our goals?
We have set ambitious targets to reduce our impact on 
climate, nature and resource circularity, with firm targets set 
for 2025 and 2030. While TenneT has to deliver on its core 
task of building, maintaining and operating the power grid, 
the materials needed to build our assets on land and at 
sea have an impact on nature, carbon emissions, and 
resource scarcity. 
As our activities and operations grow in the coming years, 
it is expected that our impact on carbon emissions will grow 
simultaneously. While we try to reduce our footprint, it remains 
a challenge to balance our growth with a lower footprint.

This is particularly challenging for our scope 3 emissions, 
where we rely on collaboration with our supply chain 
partners to reduce our carbon footprint. This continues to 
be a dilemma, as the shortage of supply chain partners 
means they can choose which projects are most suitable for 
them. Hence TenneT’s carbon reduction ambition could 
potentially limit contracting the supply chain partners on 
time. To reach our 2030 targets, we need to think ahead 
and make choices now that help us reach these targets.
Grid losses are a major contributor to our carbon emissions 
– accounting for 95%. Unfortunately, the nature of power 
transmission makes grid losses inevitable. By using more 
aluminium instead of copper as a conductor in our power 
lines, we can reduce our usage of scarce resources. 
However, this has the effect of higher grid losses as 
aluminium is a less effective conductor.
Furthermore, as our network grows onshore and offshore 
and by using more long-distance high-voltage connections, 
grid losses could grow proportionally higher. With the right 
technology for the future grid development, we will strive to 
reduce our carbon emissions.
As regards SF6 leakages, currently accounting for 1% of our 
climate footprint, we are working hard to reduce our use of 
this insulating gas. Therefore we continue to work with our 
partners in both Germany and the Netherlands to find and 
implement sustainable solutions.
Resource circularity will become increasingly important in the 
years ahead. The scarcity of virgin copper and the reduced 
usage of oil puts pressure on alternative resources. To this 
end, we are changing our tender procedure to include 
stricter circularity requirements, for example by asking 
suppliers to provide evidence of the percentage of their 
materials that are recyclable and recycled with ‘raw material 
passports’. We are also intensifying our use of LCAs, which 
allow us to calculate the lifetime environmental impact of 
products used in each project.
Considering our direct impact on nature and wildlife, we try 
to reduce bird collisions with our high-voltage lines by 
working with the right partners to identify high-risk bird 
spots and to implement preventive and animal-friendly bird 
barrier measures.

Create 
value to 
transition  
to a climate 
neutral 
economy
In the transition to a sustainable energy system, the grid is being fully 
reinforced and expanded. This also demands a lot from the environment 
and we have to handle this carefully. TenneT is fully committed to nature 
and the environment, both onshore and offshore.
“Europe faces multiple crises: an unprecedented energy crisis, intensifying 
climate change impacts and a drastic reduction of biodiversity, among others. 
Grid infrastructure is essential in the fght against climate change, energy 
dependencies and high energy prices. But, when electricity grids are planned 
and deployed in a nature-inclusive way they can contribute to biodiversity as 
well, and TenneT is setting a great example in this respect. The commitment 
to be nature net positive is a major step. Agreeing on international standards 
to monitor and report progresses are important next steps. Testing new 
practices, evaluating them and constantly increasing standards in biodiversity 
restoration is the way forward.”

Safeguard sustainable financial performance 
and investor ratings
The next years will require large scale investments in our grid as a result of the expansion of 
renewables in Germany, the Netherlands and Europe. This is the backbone for the energy 
transition. As one of the biggest investors in the energy transition in Europe, we are deeply 
committed to make an important contribution to this fundamental transformation of society 
and economy. This is also reflected in our financial strategy.
At the start of 2022, TenneT already faced a challenging 
investment agenda, with an ambitious project portfolio to 
drive the energy transition. Following the outbreak of the 
war in Ukraine in February, political and societal demands 
for energy security have intensified, resulting in calls for the 
energy transition to be accelerated even further.
In the short-term, the combined impact of disruption in the 
supply chains in the aftermath of the recent pandemic and 
the war in Ukraine led to higher prices of goods and 
services. For example increased raw material and energy 
prices, raised the costs of our investment portfolio and 
increased the costs for ancillary services which affects our 
working capital. Unpredictability in the financial markets, 
with volatile and fast-rising interest rates, further impacts our 
financing costs and planning for funding.
Despite the market conditions, the long-term external 
expectations placed on TenneT are higher than ever. Our 
annual investments are set to increase to deliver at least 
EUR 8 billion a year in projects while securing our supply 
chain, as both the EU and the Dutch and German 
governments step up their climate ambitions. Of our 
investments approximately 40% is allocated for projects in 
the Netherlands and 60% in Germany. Approximately 50% 
of our investments refers to onshore projects and 50% to 
offshore projects. These investments are necessary to 
reduce Europe’s reliance on energy imports and boost 
energy security across the region to prepare for a climate-
neutral energy system. TenneT’s investments in reinforcing, 
expanding and modernising the grid are not just about 
affordability in the here and now. They are about long-term 
affordability and security of supply for society.
The strength of our long-term role in the energy transition, 
and our solid financial position, was evidenced during 2022 
by our ability to attract the necessary financing from external 
parties. We always carefully weigh our decisions against 
three criteria: affordability, sustainability, and reliability. From 
a societal perspective, affordability is an increasingly 
important factor as the costs of the energy transition grow. 
As our activities are regulated and most of our investments 
result in societal costs, we need to be cautious and prudent 
that we invest wisely and grow responsibly.
To safeguard our financial health, we need to maintain our 
strong credit ratings and keep a healthy balance between 
equity and debt. We are committed to our A3/A- credit 
rating, as it provides us strong through-the-cycle access to 
the capital markets and allows us to borrow at the lowest 
possible costs which benefits the end-consumers we 
ultimately serve.

Impact of Ukraine war
The Ukraine war has had a notable impact on TenneT’s 
activities, accelerating rises in energy prices, as well as 
driving strong awareness of the importance of security of 
supply. To this end, TenneT is seeing companies 
accelerating their investments in electricity demand and 
governments becoming more proactive and ambitious in 
bringing about the energy transition. Both the Ukraine war 
and the COVID-19 pandemic had a major impact on the 
prices of the raw materials TenneT uses in its assets. This 
includes steel, aluminium and copper. High market price-
levels of energy have also led to a significant increase in 
ancillary services costs.
Ancillary services costs
The ancillary services costs increased from EUR 3,465 
million in 2021 to EUR 6,439 million in 2022. Ancillary 
services are costs TenneT must incur to compensate for 
grid losses, to maintain the energy balance in the grid, 
and to pay for alternative routes for the electricity when 
grid sections are congested or unavailable due to grid 
expansions. The increase of the ancillary services costs 
is mainly caused by a price effect and partly caused by 
volume effects. The electricity prices reached record levels 
in 2022, which impacted the costs of (balancing) capacity 
and energy products. The necessary planned outages in 
combination with the increasing infeed of renewables cause 
additional transmission restrictions and grid losses. 
Transmission restrictions are further impacted by changes 
in the availability of generating units as a result of the 
Ukraine war. 
Since the higher costs of the ancillary services costs will 
be reimbursed through future tariffs, underlying revenues 
increased accordingly and as such there is no impact on 
our underlying EBIT. As the ancillary services costs are 
reimbursed in future tariffs, TenneT will receive the cash 
flows at a later stage and as such TenneT is pre-financing 
these higher ancillary services costs.
Underlying revenues and EBIT
Underlying revenue increased by EUR 4,171 million to 
EUR 9,840 million. The increase in the underlying revenues 
can mainly be explained by:
• The higher costs for ancillary services in 2022 resulting in 
higher underlying revenues, since those higher costs will 
be reimbursed through future tariffs;

• Increased revenues due to ongoing and increasing 
investments, resulting in a growing regulatory asset base 
and higher onshore and offshore revenues which are 
based upon these asset base values;
• Increased regulatory returns due to increased interest 
rates.
The underlying operating result (EBIT) increased by 
EUR 376 million to EUR 1,210 million. The increase of our 
EBIT is partly caused by higher revenues as a result of 
increased regulatory returns due to increased interest rates. 
The increase of interest rates will be reflected in increased 
future finance expenses which are not part of EBIT. Higher 
auction receipts resulted in an increased result of our 
non-regulated joint venture BritNed, compared to 2021 
amounting to EUR 66 million. As per segment, for the 
TSO Netherlands EBIT amounted to EUR 312 million  
(2021: EUR 225 million) and for the TSO Germany 
to EUR 791 million (2021: EUR 561 million) during this 
period. For our non-regulated businesses EBIT amounted 
in 2022 to EUR 107 million (2021: EUR 48 million). 
 
The adjusted underlying EBIT increased from EUR 801 
million in 2021 to EUR 1,162 million in 2022.
IFRS results
Underlying financial information is based IFRS plus the 
principle of recognising regulatory assets and liabilities for all 
of our regulated activities. This implies that amounts 
resulting from past events and which are allowed to be 
received or are required to be returned through future tariffs 
are recorded as an asset or liability, respectively. TenneT’s 
Executive Board believes that the presentation of underlying 
financial information provides additional relevant insight in 
the actual financial position, financial performance, and as 
such economic reality. By comparison, the consolidated 
financial statements are prepared based on the International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European 
Union (hereafter: IFRS). Based on prevailing opinion on IFRS 
it is not allowed to recognise amounts to be received or are 
required to be returned through future tariffs. 
As such our IFRS result reflects only to date our high costs 
during 2022, mainly due to the earlier described ancillary 
services costs, but does not account for future 
reimbursements we will receive through correspondingly 
higher tariffs from grid customers. As a result, TenneT 
reports an IFRS EBIT loss for 2022 amounting to EUR 976 
million (2021: loss EUR 275 million).
Investments and raising the necessary funding
TenneT is one of the largest investors in the energy 
transition in Germany and the Netherlands. A significant part 
of our investments are directly linked to the energy 
transition. The investment programme can be divided into 
approximately 40% for the Netherlands, 60% for Germany 
and the allocation between onshore and offshore is 
approximately 50%/50%.
During 2022, within a complex and unpredictable external 
environment, TenneT continued its strong efforts to drive the 
energy transition, investing EUR 4.5 billion in the grid (2021: 
EUR 4.0 billion) and once again maintaining a high grid 
availability of 99.99963%. TenneT expects to deliver at least 
EUR 8 billion annually on projects in the coming years in the 
onshore and offshore grids in the Netherlands and Germany 
in accordance with the national energy policies of both 
countries.
Broad and sustainable access to financing is a pre-requisite 
for realising these investment goals and making the energy 
transition happen. And 2022 has made clear that 
transitioning to clean energy – and fast – is also necessary 
for political and economic security.

Outstanding green debt
in EUR billion
We need to ensure that these investments are financed with 
the right mix of equity and debt. TenneT must incur 
expenses before returning revenues and profits. To realise 
investments such as ours and build a grid that is future-
proof, we need to have funds readily available – at the right 
cost. Part of those funds come from equity and the majority 
from borrowings, mostly green bonds as well as other debt. 
Even with the high investment and financing need in mind, 
our strong credit ratings were reconfirmed in 2022.
While inflation and interest rates are rising, we are still 
well positioned to raise the necessary financing in the debt 
capital markets. Our Green Bonds, issued in May 
(EUR 3.85 billion) and October (EUR 3.0 billion) were 
amongst the largest EUR corporate bond transactions in 
2022. Apart from our strong credit ratings, we benefit from 
the fact that our Green Bonds are exactly that: green. 
They stand to pass the sustainability checks and balances 
an investor might test them against. And, of course, we 
will continue our efforts to report transparently on our 
sustainable performance in order to maintain broad and 
sustainable access to financing – green or otherwise. 
More details about our Green Bonds can be found in 
our Green Finance report.
In order to maintain our A-/A3 credit ratings and to realise 
our investment-portfolio, TenneT’s internal policy is to 
maintain a long-term average funds from operations 
(hereafter: FFO) /Net debt ratio (based on adjusted 
‘underlying’ financial information) of at least 8.5%, 
which meets the requirements for an A-/A3 credit rating 
as formulated by Standard & Poor's (hereafter: S&P) and 
Moody’s. The aim to keep the long term average adjusted 
FFO/Net Debt ratio above 8.5%, while funding the 
investment plans requires additional equity in the 
foreseeable future. The exact amount and timing of the 
equity need depends on new energy transition policies of 
governments driving the investment agenda, changes in the 
regulatory framework and on the inflationary impact on the 
cost of our investment projects.
To support our strong credit rating and fund the 
investments in the Netherlands, the Dutch state included 
EUR 5.11 billion of equity in the state budget till 2025. 
Of this budget, EUR 1.2 billion was received in 2022. 
The amounts for 2023, 2024 and 2025 of respectively 
EUR 1.8 billion, EUR 0.6 billion and EUR 1.5 billion as 
included in the budget are conditional and subject to 
final reviews. The Dutch state has allocated the capital 
contribution to the Dutch investments.

TenneT and its shareholder, the Dutch state, are engaged in 
discussions with the German government to explore the 
possibility of a full sale of TenneT’s German activities on 
acceptable terms.
Our financial strategy is focused on maintaining our credit 
rating at a minimum of A-/A3 and generating returns on 
investment in accordance with our risk profile. In 2022, our 
A- credit rating from S&P and our A3 rating from Moody’s 
were reaffirmed again. Also, our ESG evaluations were 
reaffirmed by external rating agencies. For example, S&P 
again classified us as ‘strong’ with a score of 86/100 and 
Sustainalytics indicated that TenneT is at low risk of 
experiencing material financial impacts from ESG factors.
The adjusted FFO/Net debt ratio decreased from 10.5% per 
31 December 2021 to 9.7% per 31 December 2022. The 
decrease is mainly caused by the regulatory framework 
which requires TenneT to pre-finance the ancillary services 
costs directly which will flow back to TenneT in the future 
years through the tariffs. Per 31 December 2022 TenneT 
has approximately pre-financed EUR 2.5 billion for which 
debt has incurred resulting in decreased FFO due to higher 
interest expenses, whereas net debt increased. The 
adjusted FFO/Net debt ratio adjusted for the pre-financing 
of the ancillary services costs that will be settled in future 
tariffs is: 11.0% per 31 December 2022 (2021: 10.8%).
Contribute to achieve a reliable and predictable 
regulatory framework which supports our 
financial strategy
Propelled by the war in Ukraine and the desire to gain 
independence from Russian natural gas, our investments in 
a carbon-free, secure, and reliable electricity grid are 
gathering pace. This requires constant vigilance and 
sustained investment. 
Our societal fnancial impact on households in our serving area
As we are serving society as a state-owned 
company, safeguarding our financial health is of 
paramount importance. Our revenue consists of 
the regulated income we receive for costs we 
incur to fulfil our task of securing supply today 
and tomorrow. Designing, building, maintaining, 
and operating a future-proof grid comes at a cost 
which households and companies contribute to 
via the payment of grid fees. We have calculated 
our societal financial impact on households in our 
service area. We have assessed our impact on the 
electricity invoice (retail of electricity; taxes, charges 
and levies; grid fees) of an average household in 
the Netherlands and in Germany. In Germany, our 
share is around 4.8% (2021: 5.6%). The impact with 
respect to the electricity bill on households in the 
Netherlands is more difficult to determine. This is 
due to the energy price compensation measures of 
the Dutch government in 2022. When we disregard 
the compensation measures (direct and through 
lowered taxes/levies), it is estimated that the share is 
approximately 9.1% (2021: 9.0%). When we do take 
the compensation measures into account, the part of 
the electricity bill exceeds 100%, as compensation 
measures fully negates: taxation, retail costs and 
DSO grid fees for the average household (note that 
the effects will differ per individual household).
TenneT sees that their part of the electricity bill 
(the numerator) has increased in the Netherlands, 
however, as the wholesale price of electricity also 
increased, this did not lead to a significant increase 
to our share relatively. On the German side, TenneT 
noticed that its part of the electricity bill slightly 
decreased compared to 2021 and the total electricity 
bill increased also due to the increase of the 
wholesale price of electricity.
The share of TenneT both in the Netherlands and in 
Germany might increase over the coming years, as 
the costs for the energy transition may rise, amid 
increasingly ambitious climate goals. TenneT noticed 
that governments are taking measures to reduce 
the impact of substantially increased energy prices 
for households and the effects of the investments 
required to build and maintain the grid to be able 
to secure supply today and tomorrow. An example 
of keeping the tariffs stable, is the measure by 
the German government to lower the effect of the 
required investments by ways of a federal grant. Of 
course the effect this has on the overall electricity bill 
of a household in our serving area will depend on the 
development of the wholesale price in the future.

The application of the EU Taxonomy at TenneT
The EU Taxonomy is a classification system, which 
helps to determine which economic activities related 
to a certain organisation can be considered to be 
environmentally sustainable. The aim is to provide 
clarity and a level-playing field on the contribution 
companies have in meeting Europe’s environmental 
goals in relation to the EU Green Deal. Last year, 
organisations like TenneT were requested to 
disclose the degree to which the economic activities 
of organisations are eligible to the EU Taxonomy. 
In 2021, we had performed this assessment 
and determined that our economic activities are 
eligible. This is because our primary tasks are 
to provide electricity transmission services and 
system services and to facilitate the energy market. 
Those economic activities are linked to NACE 
code D35.12 and are concluded to substantially 
contribute to climate change mitigation, since 
TenneT is transmitting and distributing renewable 
energy in line with Directive (EU) 2018/2001, 
including necessary reinforcement or extension of 
the grid. In line with technical screening criterium 
4.9 ’Transmission and distribution of electricity’ on 
climate mitigation. 
Most of our activities (the regulated business of 
the TSOs in the Netherlands and Germany) are 
eligible, since our grid is part of the interconnected 
European system. Our non-regulated activities 
were considered ineligible and have therefore been 
excluded.
The next steps taken in 2022
Determining the eligibility regarding the EU 
Taxonomy is merely one part of the equation. 
The next steps are to show so-called ‘alignment 
to the EU Taxonomy’. This means that, next to the 
assessment performed to determine eligibility, we 
also needed to assess whether we meet the ‘Do 
No Significant Harm’ (DNSH) criteria set forth in 
the technical screening criterium 4.9 as mentioned 
above. This relates to the environmental goals related 
to 'climate change adaptation’, ‘transition to a 
circular economy’, ‘pollution prevention and control’ 
and ‘protection and restoration of biodiversity and 
ecosystems’. The environmental goal of ‘water and 
marine resources’ is considered not applicable 
according to the guidance in criterium 4.9.
In addition, organisations need to state that they 
meet minimum safeguards. These relate to the 
topics of human rights, corruption, taxation and 
fair competition. We reviewed the criteria related to 
the ‘Minimum Safeguards’ to determine whether 
we believe we meet these requirements. By 
performing procedures, such as interviews with 
subject matter specialists within our company and 
review of documentation, we believe that we are 
able to meet both the DNSH criteria as well as 
the minimum safeguards and that our economic 
activity still aligns with the environmental goal of 
climate change mitigation. Also, we needed to 
verify which part of our eligible activities are also 
considered to be ‘aligned’ with the EU Taxonomy. 
This to determine which part of our overall revenue, 
operating expenses (OPEX) and capital expenditures 
(CAPEX) are considered to be Taxonomy aligned. We 
therefore performed an assessment to determined 
which part of our infrastructure relates to a direct 
connection between our substation or network and a 
power production plant that is more greenhouse gas 
intensive than 100 gCO2e/kWh measured on a life 
cycle basis. We have excluded these from our final 
calculation to determine the reporting metrics related 
to this regulation.
Reporting metrics with respect to the 
EU Taxonomy
Based on this conclusion, we then calculated the 
amounts of investments, revenues and operating 
expenditures that are associated with this economic 
activity, which is in alignment with the EU Taxonomy 
and determined which percentage this constitutes 
compared to all economic activities. This results in 
the following percentages: 
 
Total group aligned turnover: 98% 
Total group aligned CAPEX: 100% 
Total group aligned OPEX: 99% 
 
More detailed information on this can be found in 
the table. Details regarding the calculation and the 
accounting policy related to these metrics, please 
refer to the additional information included in the 
section ‘EU Taxonomy disclosure’.

As the TSO's responsibility, we need to deliver onshore and 
offshore grid expansion and renewals – on time and within 
budget. To drive the energy transition, a range of decisions 
must be made from standards on manufacturing devices, 
leaner permitting procedures, integrated system planning 
(including hydrogen) to close(r) co-operation with large 
customers, consumers, other TSOs and DSOs. This 
requires European and national legislation and regulations 
to keep pace with developments, as well as an investment 
framework that enables us to meet the needs and 
objectives of businesses, households, the economy, 
and politics. Our investments and operations need to 
be supported by a regulatory framework with a long-term 
focus and a high degree of reliability and predictability. 
While regulatory periods are typically only established for a 
period of three to five years, the underlying methodologies 
in principle provide a stable long-term regulatory framework 
in both the Netherlands and Germany. The nature of our 
business and the scale of the energy challenge require us to 
think decades ahead to determine how and where to invest. 
We need to be able to rely on a regulatory framework which 
can do the same and allows us to recover our long-term 
investment costs and our operational costs.
Together with Strategy& TenneT performed a study 
regarding improving the TSO regulation in the context 
of the European Green Deal. Regarding operational 
expenditure (OPEX) non-recovery we conclude that as 
operational costs are expected to rise structurally, the 
current revenue regulation frameworks, based on historical 
costs, leads to under-remuneration of operational costs. As 
such we propose forward-looking estimates for capitalised 
expenditure (CAPEX), OPEX and ancillary services costs. 
Revenue regulation should incentivise TSOs to implement 
cost efficient solutions in situations where OPEX- or CAPEX-
based solutions are substitutes and as such a total 
expenses (TOTEX) approach is preferred. Moreover we 
conclude that incentives to stimulate and boost more 
innovation such as digitisation and flexibility are needed as 
the current framework does not create sufficient 
momentum.
To this end, the regulatory framework in the Netherlands 
was changed by the new estimation method for OPEX and 
CAPEX. A shortfall in estimation that is based on historical 
data is mitigated by ex-post settlement of all investments 
with a in fixed assets useful life of more than 10 years, as 
growth is expected based on the planned investment of the 
Investment Plan. The regulation furthermore provides for the 
timely recovery of investments of national importance (‘Rijks 
Coördinatie Regeling’ investments) by means of direct 
compensation in the year the costs occurred (T-0). 
The operational costs estimates are based on a historical 
average of three years. Operational expenses for onshore 
are adjusted by 1% of the change in acquisition value of the 
projects to reflect growth and decline in operational costs 
as a result of changes in the asset base.
The regulation makes use of non-robust efficiency measures 
as a result of a flawed international TSO benchmark. TenneT 
clearly demonstrated the limitations and showed that the 
benchmark result cannot be applied. Following discussions, 
ACM amended the efficiency score from the initial result of 
71.5% to 89.1%. TenneT challenged this decision in court, 
as the additionally outcome is still too low in our view.
TenneT also filed an appeal on the changed regulation for 
the operational costs (not ancillary services) of the system 
operator and the project specific efficiency assessment of 
Borssele. The results of the court case are expected in 
Summer 2023.
Together with all Dutch grid operators TenneT also filed 
appeal against the determination of the WACC.
In Germany, the regulatory framework for investments  
(on- and offshore) also changed within the last years. 
A deterioration was avoided due to grandfathering rules 
and transitional regimes. TenneT considers that regulatory 
changes should never devalue already-taken investments 
as this undermines investors’ confidence in the regulatory 
framework. After the harmonisation of DSO and TSO 
investment frameworks and the Court of Justice of the 
European Union decision against Germany, TenneT holds 
the view that BNetzA should keep established and proven 
principles of a reliable and transparent regulatory frame-
work, while exercising freedom of judgement to allow for 
more innovative and future-orientated solutions to society.
In Q2 2022 ACM issued a statement with its intention to 
assess a financing solution for the impact of the current 
shortfall in remuneration for the costs of ancillary services 
due the current market conditions. ACM has meanwhile 
communicated its intention to include an advance (between 
25%-40%) of the expected difference between the 
budgeted and actual costs of ancillary services for the year 
2023 in the tariff proposal for 2024. ACM has indicated that 
the final chosen percentage within the indicated range will 
depend on the stability of the expected tariff developments. 
ACM has the intention to include an advance in the tariffs of 
2025 and 2026 as well, if the market conditions provide 
reason to do so.

In 2022, we achieved a significant regulatory milestone in 
Germany, when the government agreed to compensate for 
the higher grid fees that TenneT and other TSOs said they 
must charge in 2023 to reflect escalating wholesale power 
prices and ancillary services costs, such as redispatch. With 
grid fees accounting for around 4.2% of domestic energy 
bills and around 1.0% for industrial customers, the 
government’s compensation of around EUR 13 billion 
means the TSOs cost increases are expected to be 
absorbed. As a result, our grid fees in Germany for 2023 will 
remain on the level of 2022.
What could prevent us from realising our goals?
TenneT’s revenues depend mainly on the regulatory 
frameworks in the Netherlands and Germany and are 
important to finance our grid investment needs and 
operational costs. Any adverse changes of the regulatory 
framework or economic developments not catered for in the 
regulatory framework could impact TenneT’s overall financial 
performance. To address this risk, a reliable, appropriate 
and future-proof regulatory framework is needed and 
supported by a study with Strategy& as earlier mentioned.
The costs for ancillary services, such as for congestion 
management, balancing power and other system services, 
are rising significantly because of the Ukraine war which had 
a significant impact on the cost calculations of TSOs. These 
would have resulted in increased network charges. In 
Germany, the increase would have been of around 250%, 
of which 95% would have been due to the rising costs of 
system services. In order to cushion these considerable 
burdens for end-consumers and industry, TenneT, together 
with the other TSOs, advocated for proposals to stabilise 
the increase of German network tariffs by making use of a 
federal grant. As a result of the political negotiations with on 
the so-called ‘third relief package’ TSOs were successful in 
keeping transmission grid fees stable. The necessary 
budget of nearly EUR 13 billion is expected to be served 
from the proceeds from the skimming of windfall revenues 
of electricity generators and Germany's Economic Stability 
Fund (WSF). For 2023 electricity prices have dropped 
substantially and we expect this to have a dampening 
impact on the redispatch costs. In addition, an increase of 
our grid volume induces a further financial impact on our 
ancillary services. Ancillary services costs affect TenneT in 
multiple ways. Firstly, it puts pressure on our working capital 
needs and although compensated in a few years from now, 
the tariffs negatively impact today’s IFRS result. Secondly, 
our ancillary services costs are rising above the planned 
budgets such that the tariff revenue received today is 
insufficient and leads to additional financing needs.
To deliver our future projects on time, additional equity is 
required. While TenneT is still in a strong and healthy 
financial position, there is a risk that our current credit rating 
of A- (S&P) or A3 (Moody’s) could not be maintained. This 
risk could occur in the scenario of increasing investment 
volumes while not being able to raise sufficient additional 
equity on time. While it would be possible -although not 
easy- to attract future debt by issuing green bonds, as 
TenneT has successfully done in the past, this could 
negatively affect the FFO/Net debt ratio and further induce 
negative pressure on our credit rating. Therefore, attracting 
equity on time to finance our operations and to maintain a 
healthy balance between debt and equity becomes and 
remains important.
Electricity Revenue Cap in Germany
The Electricity Revenue Cap Act (‘Strompreis-
bremsegesetz, StromPBG’) was passed by the 
German legislator on 20 December 2022 and 
went into force on 24 December in the same year. 
It aims to protect domestic end-consumers in 
2023 from strongly increased electricity prices 
resulting from the turmoil on the energy markets in 
Europe following the Ukraine war. Energy suppliers 
will process the price caps in their individual 
invoices with end-consumers. The aggregated 
financial impact of this will be paid out starting in the 
first quarter of 2023 by the TSOs to the energy 
suppliers on the basis of aggregated volume data. 
The TSOs are compensated for these payments 
by direct transfers from the government and by 
funds received from electricity generators. To enable 
the process, detailed rules for the calculation 
of excess revenues from generators as well as for 
the settlement and pay out to end-consumers 
are determined in the law. Furthermore, the 
German regulator BNetzA has an oversight role in 
the process. Payments from TSOs to end-consumers 
via the energy suppliers started in February 2023 with 
retroactive effect as per January. First governmental 
transfer payments to bridge-finance occurred in 
February 2023. The first inflow of excess revenues 
from generators is expected for mid of August 2023. 
TSOs do not expect any liquidity or profitability risks 
from the regime which they perform as trustees of 
society and on a pass-through basis.

In the energy system of the future, there is an important role for 
offshore-generated wind power. As manager of the offshore electricity 
grid, TenneT performs the important task of connecting this green 
power to the national electricity grid. 
“The government's objective is to generate around 21 gigawatts of electricity 
via offshore wind around 2030. I am impressed by the innovative solutions 
TenneT is developing to carry out this task as quickly, reliably and at the 
lowest possible social cost. The production and transmission of this green 
power is essential for the future of the Netherlands. Firstly, of course, to 
combat climate change, but also to become more independent in our energy 
supply. We need to become independent of Russian gas as soon as possible 
and our own energy generation is crucial for this.”

Solve societal challenges with stakeholders and through 
partnerships
The energy transition is one of the biggest technological and societal challenges of our 
times. Shifting from fossil-based power to mainly renewable power by the EU’s target of 2050 
means that Europe’s energy system will undergo fundamental changes in the coming 
decades. The task of achieving these goals is too great for any one player to act alone. 
It requires smart solutions and a tremendous collective effort from multiple stakeholders.
As a leading European TSO, TenneT plays a key role in 
realising Europe’s clean energy targets. With our 
knowledge, expertise and vision, we can provide valuable 
insights into the future energy landscape. But to accomplish 
this, we need to work together with a wide range of 
partners to find innovative solutions, work more efficiently 
and at the lowest achievable costs. That is why we 
collaborate intensively with partners within and outside the 
sector, including with academic institutions, government 
agencies, technology providers, suppliers and other players 
in the energy market.
TenneT seeks to actively participate in the dialogue and 
co-operation with our stakeholders to address the 
complexities of the energy transition. For example, in the 
Netherlands we have a close co-operation with all DSOs in 
the association Netbeheer Nederland. In addition, we work 
together with other European TSOs as a member of the 
European Network of Transmission System Operators 
(ENTSO-E), and with industry partners through co-operation 
with industry associations such as Bundesverband der 
Deutschen Industrie (BDI), Energie Nederland and 
Vereniging voor Energie, Milieu and Water (VEMW). 
Furthermore, we are a member of the Nederlandse 
Vereniging voor Duurzame Energie (NVDE) and participate in 
think tanks such as Agora Energiewende on topics related 
to the energy transition. These partnerships are essential 
not only to deliver on our own strategic goals, but also to 
achieve the societal objectives of building an affordable, 
reliable and sustainable energy system.
Traditionally, our electricity model was based on a simpler 
model where a small number of power generation plants 
would serve a large number of customers, with electricity 
transmitted over relatively short distances. Today, electricity 
can be generated in any place, from home roof-mounted 
solar panels to onshore wind turbines and large wind farms 
far out in the North Sea. With widely distributed sources of 
power, small and large, and the volatility of the weather, a 
renewables-based electricity system has to be designed in 
a completely new way. This brings huge challenges for the 
usage and expansion of the electricity network and the 
dynamic stability of the power system.
Strategic partnerships and innovation are not only essential 
to unlocking new technological solutions that drive the 
energy transition; they are also critical to TenneT’s strategic 
objectives to secure supply today and tomorrow, energise 
our people and workforce and safeguard our financial health.
As new technologies transform the way electricity is 
generated, carried, stored, traded and consumed, 
innovation is also important for market design. The latter 
includes the entry of small and larger parties that will play 
an important role in maintaining the balance on the high-
voltage grids and/or providing the necessary flexibility in a 
system largely based on weather-dependent energy sources.
Our performance in 2022
In the challenging times experienced in the energy sector 
during 2022, innovation and partnerships remain at the top 
of the agenda for TenneT. Considering the push by national 
governments to achieve greater energy security and 
the recent acceleration in Europe’s ambitions for offshore 
energy, we believe that innovation and partnerships are key 
in designing the future energy system. This is why our 
innovation efforts are focused on the technology and 
solutions needed to develop a high-capacity and integrated 
offshore and onshore future grid.
Part of the innovation process at TenneT takes place 
bottom-up, with ideas generated by employees as well as 
external stakeholders, for example through crowdsourcing. 
Crowdsourcing is the process of connecting large groups of 
people based on their knowledge, expertise, commitment 
or profession. Top-down, the innovation process is driven 
by TenneT’s mission and strategic priorities. 
Our partnerships with the academic world, research 
centres, DSOs and TSOs, and our involvement in various

associations such as CIGRE or ENTSO-E also play an 
important role in our innovation process. During 2022, 
TenneT was actively involved in over 90 innovative projects.
Partnerships to secure supply, today and 
tomorrow
In 2022, energy security in Europe became an urgent issue. 
As such, renewed focus was placed on accelerating the 
shift to a future-proof energy system and developing 
cross-border connections and market solutions for boosting 
security of electricity supply in Northwest Europe. At the 
same time, the rapid increase in offshore wind and solar 
generation, as well as electrification by industry and 
consumers, has put pressure on our onshore grid and 
raised the need for technological solutions and partnerships 
to increase the capacity and utilisation of our system (see 
‘Deliver a high security of supply’ chapter). Although we are 
building new assets to increase grid capacity every year, we 
cannot relieve all bottlenecks within the grid, leading to 
more congestion.
In 2022, several innovation projects focused on securing 
supply today and tomorrow by advancing the technologies 
required for a high-capacity and integrated offshore and 
onshore grid. Through these partnerships, we aim to tackle 
some of the main challenges that we foresee in securing 
supply, today and tomorrow. 
Innovating DC technology
The future electricity grid will increasingly depend on 
high-voltage DC (HVDC) technology, as it allows TSOs to 
transmit far higher volumes of DC power to the onshore grid 
over much longer distances. It also results in lower grid 
losses, more cost-efficiency and a lower environmental 
impact. However, developing an interconnected and 
interoperable DC grid requires significant innovation in DC 
technology, requiring the collaboration of multiple partners 
alongside TenneT.
For example, it will require DC circuit-breakers and 
interoperable multi-vendor DC convertors. To develop these 
new technologies and other solutions, TenneT participates 
in READY4DC, a large and diverse community of experts, 
including technology suppliers, which will assess the major 
technical and legal aspects of building an interoperable 
multi-terminal, multi-vendor DC grid in Europe.
Another key challenge of innovating DC technology is 
interoperability, as multiple converter stations from a variety 
of technology providers (multivendor) will need to be 
integrated. To explore this topic, TenneT is involved in a 
partnership project called InterOPERA. Focused on 
enabling interoperability of multi-vendor HVDC grids, the 
project proposes a coordinated approach between a 
diverse, high-level group of industries at the forefront of 
renewable energy development and grid management. With 
four HVDC vendors, eight other TSOs, two wind turbine 
vendors and three wind park developers, the project brings 
industrial knowledge and practical abilities together to make 
future HVDC systems mutually compatible and 
interoperable by design.
TenneT is also working with partners to ensure the 
development of HVDC technology in future grids is as 
reliable as possible. This will help ensure HVDC can 
contribute to security of supply in a renewables-based 
energy system and help to accelerate the energy transition. 
These aims are the focus of HVDC-Wise, a multidisciplinary 
project engaging 14 partners from 11 countries including 
five academic institutions, four TSOs and five industrial 
bodies. It will assess future HVDC-based grid architecture 
concepts and their ability to fulfil TSOs’ resilience and 
reliability needs. The project will identify and assess new 
technologies for HVDC-based grid architecture and how they 
could be deployed in widespread AC/DC transmission grids.
Finally, the development of DC grid solutions requires the 
efficient integration of the onshore- and offshore grid. 
With fellow TSOs and technology suppliers, we are working 
together on the development of Multi-terminal DC hubs 
to support extremely large amounts of renewable energy 
sources being fed into the grid and distributed to end-users 
without causing congestion in the network. More on this 
can be found in the chapter ‘Ensure critical infrastructure for 
society’.
Increasing grid utilisation
One of the most important ways to secure supply today, is 
to improve the resilience of our grid and maximise the use 
of our existing assets: by improving grid utilisation, we can 
do more with what we already have. This reduces the need 
to constantly expand our grid, and thereby benefits society 
by allowing us to drive the energy transition faster, with 
improved affordability and security of supply.
This was the core aim of the InnoSys 2030 research project, 
which was successfully completed in December 2021. 
A total of 17 partners including transmission and distribution 
system operators, control system manufacturers and 
research institutes, investigated how grid utilisation can be 
increased over a three-year project, with new concepts, 
simulations, demonstrations and field experiments. The 
consortium developed a roadmap that provides an 
implementation path for the new concepts, such as load

flow optimisation and ‘curative’ remedial measures, until 
2030 and beyond. Part of these follow-up actions are being 
taken up in a new project introduced in 2022 called 
PROGRESS.
Optimising grid control 
Similar to the InnoSys 2030 project, the Control Room of 
the Future (CROF) aims to prepare system operations for 
the future, from methodology, process and tools 
perspectives. For instance, it looks at increasing grid 
utilisation and automation, by making TenneT’s grid control 
centres future-proof so they can handle the challenges of 
our increasingly data-driven grid. The CROF programme 
also supports our operators as they adapt to the new 
systems and workloads associated with our changing grid, 
including training and skills. A roadmap for the CROF R&D 
programme has been set, including software development, 
grid data, grid security assessment, system dynamics, 
decision support, communication interfaces and operator 
training. The roadmap for technology and methodology 
includes several topics that are to be developed until 2031.
Digitalisation and data exchange
Designing a resilient and efficient energy system of the 
future will depend on a reliable and secure architecture for 
exchanging data across borders, between different energy 
players and with consumers. It will also need to be robust, 
to cope with increasing decentralisation and complexity, 
and enable interoperability between energy systems. To 
work towards this goal TenneT is among partners 
participating in the international GAIA-X project. 
Representatives from business, science and politics 
collaborate to create a proposal for the next generation of 
data infrastructure, including the realisation of sovereign 
data exchange in a European cloud. Having received 
funding in 2021, the project is scheduled for three years 
and, once completed, aims to set a new standard in energy 
data exchange.
Partnerships to drive the energy transition
To meet the challenges of the energy transition, we need to 
work in partnership with a wide range of players to unlock 
the technological solutions that will enable a climate neutral 
energy system for Europe. Driven by political climate 
ambitions and geopolitical uncertainty in Europe, the 
political and social momentum behind the energy transition 
has never been higher, requiring all stakeholders to work 
together to accelerate the realisation of climate targets.
Designing the future grid
At TenneT, our wide-ranging work to build the grid of the 
future in time to meet Europe’s climate goals is organised 
under our Target Grid 2045, which includes a roadmap for 
growing our infrastructure, using a wide range of smart 
solutions and innovative technology. In addition to planning 
the infrastructure required for a future-proof energy system, 
TenneT is also conducting studies to plan the market design 
instruments needed. This is the aim of project MARGRET 
(Market and Grid Alignment and an Efficient Energy 
Transition). After more than a year of research and 
collaboration across departments and with external 
stakeholders, the project team aimed to set the vision for a 
robust energy market design that can enable the energy 
transition. For example, it stressed the importance of 
unbiased price signals and grid tariffs, as well as accounting 
for physical constrains in energy prices. In total, the project 
produced eight viewpoints that will now serve as a guide for 
new initiatives related to energy market design.
Achieving the energy transition also depends on the 
development of a fully integrated and cross-border 
connected offshore grid. TenneT is already advanced with 
the connection of offshore wind farms to the onshore grid, 
but in the future it sees the need for the large scale roll-out 
and integration of offshore wind in the North Sea through 
the development of interconnected power hubs. In the long-
running North Sea Wind Power Hub (NSWPH) project, 
TenneT Netherlands, TenneT Germany, Energinet and 
Gasunie propose a fundamentally new approach to long- 
term offshore grid planning, combining wind power in-feed 
and interconnection to surrounding North Sea countries. 
A research and engagement programme has been in 
execution which currently forms the basis for several 
initiatives to prepare for the first ‘hub-and-spoke’ projects, 
meaning that offshore wind farms will connect to one or 
several hub islands. Based on the NSWPH expertise, the 
Dutch government announced in 2019 that the roll-out 
ambitions of offshore wind from 2031 onwards will follow 
this hub based approach. Accordingly, the first hub projects 
in the North Sea are now under exploration, as well as the 
collaboration between the North Sea countries to jointly 
develop the first hub and spokes projects.
Flexibility and energy system coupling
In the future energy system, a wide variety of 
complementary energy sources will need to be integrated 
into the grid. For example, electrolysers will use wind and 
solar-generated energy to create green hydrogen that can 
be used to store electricity or as fuel for heating and 
transport. Batteries will also be used as a flexible source of 
energy, in static battery parks or in mobile devices such as 
electric vehicles. The coupling of these energy 
infrastructures will be key to the success of a renewable 
energy-based power system.

Page 77:
To plan for this, TenneT teamed up with Dutch DSOs and 
the gas grid operator Gasunie to conduct studies on the 
optimal energy infrastructure required in Germany and the 
Netherlands in 2050. The scenarios in Infrastructure 
Outlook 2050 / II3050 show that all energy infrastructures 
will have to expand considerably, and that there will be a 
great need for new forms of flexibility, such as hydrogen 
storage and batteries. The studies also conclude that 
governmental direction is needed regarding the size and 
location of flexibility assets – such as electrolysers – in the 
energy network. Electrolysers have the potential to 
contribute significant electrical loads. For example, the 
Dutch government is planning to build electrolysers with a 
capacity of 3 to 4 GW by 2030, while Germany is planning 
5 GW by 2030.
Furthermore, together with fellow European TSOs, TenneT 
is developing a Crowd Balancing Platform called Equigy. 
This cross-border blockchain platform enables participants 
to actively offer smaller flexibility devices, such as car or 
home batteries, on the electricity balancing markets. As 
traditional consumers of electricity can now also become a 
provider of flexibility services, Equigy opens up the market 
to more participants and aims to increase decentralised 
flexibility by doing so. 
Accelerating our projects through partnerships with 
suppliers 
To make the energy transition happen in the relatively short 
time of European climate targets, we need to work closely 
with our contractors, building long-term relationships that 
give them confidence to invest and share our growth. Given 
the volatile supplier market and supply chain disruption that 
increased in 2022, it is even more critical for TenneT to 
create long-lasting relationships with its key contractors. 
This philosophy was piloted in 2021 with the EU-303 
framework contract, initially used in onshore substation 
building and maintenance contracts in the Netherlands with 
nine of our international supply chain partners. Following the 
success of this model, further EU-30x and other framework 
contracts were developed in the course of 2022, most 
notably with the new framework agreements introduced for 
tenders for our pioneering 2GW Program (see ‘Ensure 
Critical Infrastructure for Society’), with a focus on 
sustainability. 
Partnerships to energise our people and 
organisation
As TenneT aims to accommodate a workforce of up to 
10,000 people by 2025, we need to step up our efforts to 
hire new talents and retain our current workforce. Therefore, 
we need to create an energising, inclusive, diverse and 
sustainable workplace, where people from all types of 
backgrounds can thrive. This requires innovative 
approaches and new partnerships with stakeholders 
within and outside the energy sector. 
Academic partnerships
To foster connections and recruit new talent – especially 
scarce technical talent – it is essential for TenneT to forge 
close partnerships with the academic world and research 
centres, such as FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg, TU Ilmenau 
and TU Delft. With the University of Bayreuth, TenneT 
has signed a letter of intent aimed to foster knowledge 
exchange and joint research projects, as well as training 
and marketing of an energy cluster in Bayreuth. In the 
Netherlands together with the vocational education 
institute ROC van Twente TenneT is offering a new module 
specifically designed to prepare technicians for the energy 
transition. Vocational technical training programmes like this 
are essential for building the talent resources we need to 
drive the energy transition at speed and scale in the 
Netherlands and Germany.
Attracting diverse talent
For many years, TenneT has worked closely with the 
Refugee Talent Hub in the Netherlands and TENT 
Partnership in Germany to provide opportunities for 
refugees through apprenticeships and vocational training. 
Both schemes link refugees and employers with paid 
employment as the goal. We are keen to offer opportunities 
for learning and potential employment with refugees, which 
also helps to drive the diversity of talent we have within 
TenneT. In 2022 we organised open days with Refugee 
Talent Hub to allow refugee talents to learn more about the 
company and to meet members of staff. In 2022 we were 
proud to offer 10 newcomers a work experience position. 
Of the newcomers that started before 2022, seven have 
found permanent employment at TenneT. 
Collaborative innovation
To engage and connect diverse talent and drive ideas 
forward internally, we have set up a collaborative innovation 
network called the Acceleration Room. It was established 
to improve our internal transparency and company-wide 
communication regarding TenneT's innovation activities.

It also helps us to accelerate ideas at an early stage by 
connecting different units of the organisation to share 
insights and latest developments on our wide-ranging 
innovation work.
Partnerships to safeguard our financial health 
To ensure we are able to meet the expectations of our 
capital providers and also contribute to an affordable energy 
system, we aim to make the right choices to help achieve 
this. This means working together with stakeholders that 
can provide us the option to finance future projects, doing 
so with better conditions that help us deliver on our 
strategic ambitions. 
Dialogues with our regulators
To secure our financial health, TenneT aims to contribute 
to a reliable and predictable regulatory framework that 
supports our (financial) strategy. Therefore, we engage in 
dialogues with our regulators to discuss our strategy and 
the role of regulation in this. In 2022, we organised Board to 
Board meetings with Dutch and German regulators, and 
also held meetings with our national regulators and ACER to 
explain our strategic topics. In addition to this, we were in 
intensive exchange with all relevant stakeholders regarding 
the development of the grid fees for 2023 and specifically 
discussed the reimbursement of significantly higher costs 
for ancillary services. Finally, we held several meetings to 
prepare the fourth regulatory period in Germany (2024-
2028) and continued the appeal process against the current 
regulatory period in the Netherlands (2022-2026). 
Our co-operation with co-investors
To finance the expansion of offshore grid connections, 
TenneT co-operates with external co-investors such as 
KfW-IPEX, Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) and 
Chubu Electric Power. Via separate legal entities the 
co-investors contribute equity and receive financial 
participation rights in return. Their contribution helps 
to ensure adequate financial ratios. Furthermore, their 
participation strengthens TenneT’s interest in a reliable and 
stable regulatory framework as co-investors interests have 
been communicated to policymakers and regulators.
Partner banks
To secure a solid financing and ensure that we can drive the 
energy transition in an affordable way, we maintain strong 
relationships with our shareholder, the Dutch state, and with 
the banks that participate in TenneT’s Revolving Credit 
Facility (RCF) – ABN AMRO, BNG, BNP Paribas, 
Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, ING, NatWest, 
Rabobank, Santander, UniCredit and SMBC. The majority 
of these relationship banks also participated in TenneT’s 
previous RCF, showing the strength of our long-term 
relationships. Through these partnerships, we are able to 
secure our financing.
In 2022, we issued EUR 6.85 billion of Green Bonds with 
the support of our banking partners and have become the 
largest EUR corporate green debt issuer globally. The 
financial importance of this model is strengthened by the 
growing number of investors seeking to invest in companies 
that contribute to the EU’s Green Deal ambitions, such as 
companies with activities that align with the EU Taxonomy. 
More information on how TenneT assessed how our 
activities are eligible with the EU Taxonomy can be found in 
the chapter 'Safeguard sustainable financial performance 
and investor ratings'. 
What could prevent us from realising our goals?
In 2022, the turbulence in the energy markets and energy 
crisis – caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – increased 
the urgency to accelerate the energy transition by the Dutch 
and German governments. This was demonstrated by the 
recent Esbjerg Declaration of May 2022. As two-thirds of 
the capacity in this ambitious offshore plan (40 GW) is 
accounted for by TenneT, the scale of the challenge is clear.
To accomplish the innovation portfolio, it is essential to 
establish a wide range of skilled partners and develop 
innovative solutions together, for instance with the European 
Network of Transmission System Operators (ENTSO-E), 
academic institutions, government agencies and technology 
providers. We need to continue developing attractive and 
mutually beneficial business solutions – such as our 
long-term framework agreements for our 2GW Program – 
to ensure we bring our best partners with us to achieve our 
goals. Therefore, it remains important to focus on the right 
processes and improve where necessary so that we can 
attract the right partnerships at the right time.

16 March 2022 - 17 days after request and more than 1 year 
before planned. This acceleration of the synchronisation 
project, ongoing since 2017, has been possible thanks 
to the previous studies carried out and the adoption of 
risks mitigation measures. Continental Europe TSOs are 
now supporting the stability of the Ukrainian-Moldovan 
power system and at the same time making available 
interconnection capacity to allow export or import of energy 
as needed by Ukraine and Moldova. The extraordinary will 
of co-operation and help of all TSOs (also for humanitarian 
reasons) was key for the success of the work of the Task 
Force that was put in place the day after Russian invasion. 
This was an outstanding example of what cooperation 
between TSOs can achieve.”

Statements of the Executive Board
The Executive Board is responsible for designing and operating TenneT's risk management 
and internal control system, and for reviewing its effectiveness.
Statement of responsibility
The Executive Board is responsible for designing and 
operating TenneT's risk management and internal control 
system, and for reviewing its effectiveness.
The risk management and internal control system consists 
of the following elements:
• The enterprise risk management system aimed to 
identify, analyse, define mitigating measures and monitor 
the development of risks relevant to TenneT;
• The internal control framework aimed to manage and 
control critical processes, including control self-
assessments to document the effectiveness of control 
processes;
• Business plans and quarterly reports with information on 
financial and non-financial objectives and their 
achievement;
• Internal audits of key processes and follow-up on audit 
findings with relevant management;
• Actions based on recommendations made in the external 
auditor’s management letter;
• An upwardly cascading internal Letter of Representation 
(LOR) process, resulting in a company-wide LOR signed 
by the Executive Board;
• A compliance management system that enables TenneT 
to demonstrate its compliance with relevant laws- and 
regulations, industry codes and standards, as well as its 
commitment to good corporate governance, best 
practices, ethics and stakeholder expectations among 
others risk of internal fraud, bribery or corruption.
The Executive Board periodically reviews and analyses the 
strategic, operational, financial and compliance risks to 
which TenneT is exposed. It also regularly assesses the 
design and effectiveness of the risk management and 
internal control system. The results of these assessments 
are shared with the Audit, Risk & Compliance Committee, 
acting as a committee of Supervisory Board, the 
Supervisory Board itself and the external auditor.
The risk management and internal control system does not 
provide absolute assurance that all corporate objectives will 
be fully achieved, nor does it give full assurance that 
material errors, losses, fraud or violations of laws and 
regulations will not occur in the operational processes and/
or the financial reporting.
Taking the above into account, the Executive Board is of 
the opinion that TenneT's risk management and internal 
control system provides reasonable assurance that 
TenneT's financial reporting does not contain any errors 
of material significance and that the risk management 
and internal control system has operated effectively in 
the year under review. 
In control statement
We confirm that, to the best of our knowledge, the financial 
statements for the period 1 January to 31 December 2022 
have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by 
the EU, and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code; 
that the disclosures in the financial statements are a true 
and fair view of TenneT's assets, liabilities, financial position 
and results as a whole; and that the disclosures in the  
Integrated Annual Report give a true and fair review of 
TenneT's financial performance, results and position, 
together with a description of the most significant risks and 
uncertainties the company faces. Furthermore, we confirm 
that to the best of our knowled       ge, the Group has adequate 
resources to remain in operation during the next 12 months 
and consequently the financial statements have been 
prepared on a going concern basis.

Supervisory Board Report
The year 2022 has been unprecedented, with geopolitical developments that also impacted 
TenneT in various ways. These were closely monitored and discussed by the Supervisory 
Board (‘SB’). In addition to the core topics of safety and security of supply, the SB paid 
attention to the increasing political and ambitions from industrial parties related to the energy 
transition, managing potential limitations in the supply chain, the duration of planning and 
licensing procedures and the scarcity of talent in the labour market. The SB exercised both its 
roles, supervising the way the TenneT is managed by the Executive Board (‘EB’) and acting 
as an adviser to the EB.
1. Safety
TenneT’s SB deeply regrets two fatalities in 2022.  
On 9 May 2022, in the warehouse Wernberg-Köblitz 
(Project Ostbayernring) a TenneT employee suffered fatal 
injuries when a load fell off a loader. On 13 July 2022, in the 
contractor construction warehouse in Emden (Project 
Emden Ost-Conneforde), an employee from a contractor 
suffered fatal injuries when a steel element fell from a truck. 
The SB noted the investigations were completed in full 
co-operation with all the authorities and improvement 
measures were taken, which will be audited in Q1 2023.
Safety is top of mind for the SB. SB meetings always 
start with an update on Safety, Security of Supply and 
Compliance. Safety incidents and measures to be taken are 
pre-discussed in more depth in every Strategic Investment 
Committee (‘SIC’) meeting before being discussed in the 
SB meetings.
In the first half of 2022, DNV executed at the EB's request 
a thorough and company-wide safety review. This review 
led to various improvement measures that have been 
adopted: i) the implementation of an occupational health & 
safety system, ii) the clarification of roles & responsibilities, 
iii) the sharpening of the organisational structure and iv) the 
improvement of risk management.

In addition, TenneT’s Life Saving Rules campaign has been 
rolled out across the organisation and all contractors 
and sub-contractors, in conjunction with the so-called Fair 
Approach. The Fair Approach consistently investigates why 
Life Saving Rules are violated and in cases where it was 
done willfully, consequences will follow.
The SB is content that from 2023, quarterly Safety reports 
will be on the SIC, on the basis of which an in-depth 
dialogue can be held, not only on the figures, but also on 
trends and actions to be taken.
Furthermore, three Safety Summits with top leaders from 
TenneT’s contractors and sub-contractors are in progress: 
Offshore, Onshore DE and Onshore NL. The last of these 
has taken place in 2023. The first two have proved useful 
and  were appreciated by the participants.
Apart from the fatal incidents, other safety trends in TenneT 
are improving for both leading and lagging indicators. 
However, safety is not on the zero harm level where the SB 
and the company want it to be. Therefore, safety will remain 
a top priority for the SB, the EB and the entire company.
2. Security of Supply and Driving the Energy 
Transition
Ensuring Security of Supply today and tomorrow is and 
remains a crucial topic for TenneT and the SB. The 
increasing investment portfolio to be realised for the energy 
transition due to political ambitions on the one hand, and 
the increased demand from industry for electrification on the 
other, has had the SB’s constant attention. Potentially 
limiting factors for the amount and duration of the projects 
to be carried out (e.g. limitations in the supply chain due to 
geopolitical developments, scarcity in talent for TenneT and 
its stakeholders and delays in licensing procedures) have 
been discussed extensively, as well as mitigating measures 
to be taken. This topic will remain high on the agenda of the 
coming years.
Another aspect of Security of Supply that has been 
discussed in detail is the cyber and physical security of 
TenneT’s assets and collaboration with relevant authorities. 
The SB will continue to monitor these matters closely.
3. People at the heart of TenneT
In various meetings different topics regarding the well-being 
of TenneT employees have been discussed, such as safety 
(including psychological safety to speak up when needed), 
workload and recruiting/ onboarding as well as talent 
development. The SB regularly spoke with TenneT directors, 
senior leaders and experts, as well as with the works 
council and confidants. Further to regular meetings of the 
two SB members with an ‘enhanced recommendation right 
for the works council’ (see paragraph 8. ‘Remuneration and 
Appointment Committee’), the SB met with the works 
council and had a plenary dialogue on energy market and 
political developments. The SB values these contacts with 
the works council because in these touch points the topics 
that are important to the employees of TenneT emerge.
4. Safeguarding financial health
The SB greatly appreciates how, in unprecedented and 
volatile times, the EB has been able to maintain healthy 
liquidity and attract timely and additional green debt 
financing.
The financing for TenneT’s projects was, and is, a pivotal 
topic that the SB discussed with the EB in 2022. In 
particular, the SB has been in close dialogue with the EB 
on the rising equity need for the coming decade and the 
different funding options and strategic scenarios in the 
current political context. The SB fully supports TenneT’s 
intention to engage in discussions with the German 
government and to explore the possibility of a full sale of its 
German activities on acceptable terms.
On 24 February 2023, the Council of Ministers decided that 
the Dutch cabinet wants to explore a full sale of TenneT’s 
German activities to the German state as the preferred 
scenario to meet TenneT Germany's own equity need. The 
SB will continue to maintain close contact with both the EB 
and the shareholder on this future-defining topic in 2023.
Furthermore, the SB discussed TenneT’s financing plan and 
credit rating. Next to that, rising costs of materials, 
equipment, energy and personnel were on the agenda 
regularly in relation to the regulatory regime on the one 
hand, and the increased grid tariffs on the other. The SB 
also liaised with the EB several times on the upcoming ESG 
reporting obligations.
5. Executive Board
The SB welcomed Arina Freitag as CFO, from 1 January 2022 
and was pleased that the shareholder reappointed  
Manon van Beek as CEO for a second four-year term, after 
nomination by the SB. The SB expressed its thanks for her 
continuously excellent work in driving the energy transition 
on a European level (for example at the Esbjerg summit), 
for positioning TenneT as a customer and employer of 
choice and for her very thorough stakeholder management.

The SB is very much looking forward to monitoring and 
cooperating with the EB on driving the energy transition and 
is delighted to see how the EB operates as a true team who 
complement and challenge each other well.
Due to the increasing investment portfolio and the 
challenges that raises, in terms of stakeholder management 
and the responsible growth agenda within TenneT, the SB 
liaised with the EB on the current composition of the EB 
and the team of directors reporting to the EB. It was 
concluded in a constructive dialogue that the current top 
structure and governance is fit for the near future and the 
improvements in Audit, Risk and Compliance, IT, Digital and 
Safety and Security are fully supported. This topic will be 
revisited periodically.
The SB has had good and occasionally critical dialogues 
with the EB which were reciprocated constructively. The 
co-operation has been excellent and the SB is looking 
forward to its continuation.
6. Supervisory Board; composition
The SB was pleased that the shareholder reappointed the 
chair of the SB, Ab van der Touw, for a second four-year 
term. The SB appreciated his wise chairmanship, leading to 
fruitful dialogues, and his broad and international expertise. 
Under the leadership of Mr. Van der Touw, the Supervisory 
Board has grown to be a truly European, diverse and 
well-matched team with complimentary knowledge and 
experience and opportunity for constructive countervailing 
power where necessary.
The SB itself consists of five people – three women and two 
men. The SB members represent various European 
nationalities. All SB members have ample experience in 
both executive and supervisory board roles in the 
Netherlands, Germany and other European countries, thus 
reflecting TenneT’s truly European character.
The SB deliberated on its own composition and size too. In 
view of TenneT’s growing investment portfolio and the 
changing environment that TenneT operates in 
and, consequently, the SB's tasks, the SB has decided to 
add a sixth SB member, as was the case in the recent past. 
The profile for this new SB member is an international/
European profile with knowledge and experience in the field 
of security.
In parallel, the search for the successor of Ms L. Griffith was 
started, for which role experience in law and regulation and 
knowledge of politics is desirable. In line with the so-called 
‘enhanced recommendation right’ the Dutch Works Council 
is involved in both searches. The shareholder has given 
feedback on both function - and candidate profiles and the 
plan is to strengthen the SB with these two members by 
mid-2023.
The composition of the SB complies with the Dutch 
Electricity Act, which stipulates that the majority of its 
members have no direct or indirect links to legal entities (or 
shareholders thereof) engaged in the production, purchase 
or supply of electricity or gas. While it was noted that Ms E. 
Kairisto is also a member of the supervisory board of 
Fortum Oyj and that Mr S. van Els is a member of the 
supervisory board of EVOS B.V. and CEO of HyCC B.V. (the 
Hydrogen Chemistry Company), the SB concluded that 
these roles currently do not contradict this stipulation.
For more information on individual members of the SB, as 
well as on the appointment and reappointment schedule, 
please visit TenneT’s website.
7. SB meetings
The SB met eleven times in 2022 – twice in person at 
‘offsite’ meetings with a site visit. One offsite meeting in Q2 
took place at the high voltage station in Diemen that is 
currently being refurbished and which is an important node 
in TenneT's high-voltage grid. The other meeting in Q3 took 
place in the Port of Rotterdam/ Maasvlakte. Both were very 
insightful: the high voltage station in Diemen because of the 
various contractors and stakeholders involved. In the Port 
of Rotterdam the energy transition was almost tangible: 
some of TenneT’s offshore wind farm connections are 
connected in the area, which also has a great industry 
demand for electrification.
Agendas for SB meetings are always set in dialogue with 
the chair of the SB, considering whether certain topics may 
lead to a potential conflict of interest for any of the SB 
members. If that may the case, the respective SB member 
is informed prior to the meeting, documentation is not 
shared with the respective SB member, and he/she is asked 
to step out of the meeting for the duration of that topic. The 
meetings start with the topics of safety, security of supply 
and compliance, the latter to ensure that there are no topics 
on the agenda that may prevent any SB member from 
participation in dialogues and decision-making and to share 
relevant experiences about compliance, if any.
Topics prepared in the committee meetings that the SB 
discussed in more depth were, amongst others: 
• political ambitions and a feasible investment agenda;
• stakeholder management and communication, including 
expectation management and an open stakeholder

dialogue in the areas where TenneT is building new 
transmission infrastructure;
• congestion;
• optimisation of internal procedures of various kinds (e.g. 
investment thresholds, certain internal controls);
• the most optimal form for TenneT’s insurance;
• cost developments in projects, grid tariffs, etc. in relation 
to the Dutch and German regulatory regimes;
• TenneT’s performance in the field of Environmental, 
Social and Governance (‘ESG’).
All of TenneT’s reporting, both internal, such as the quarterly 
reports, and external reports (Integrated Annual Report and 
Half Year Results Report) as well as the reporting by the 
external auditor were also prepared in the ARCC and 
discussed by the SB in this way.
The topic of finding an equity financing solution for the 
coming years for TenneT’s investment portfolio both in the 
Netherlands and Germany was on every SB agenda.
In addition, the shareholder’s new policy on state 
participations and its impact on TenneT was discussed:
• Strategy: a more active role for the shareholder in the 
consultation process;
• Foreign activities: the shareholder will regard these 
critically on whether they contribute directly or indirectly 
to the public interest and whether they are a core activity 
or closely related to a core activity;
• Investments: realising the energy transition requires a 
broader view and influences the weighting of risks 
against a large public interest; 
• Appointments of EB and SB members: for EB members 
the appointment terms will now also be two times four 
years, as they were for SB members with a possible 
extension of two times two years in well-motivated 
cases; 
• Furthermore, more attention must be paid to diversity in 
the broad sense (not only gender); 
• Financial position: KPI targets will be set for expected 
return, capital position and operational performance 
appropriate for the nature of the state participation. There 
will be more attention for special circumstances, such as 
the energy transition; 
• Corporate Social Responsibility: the increased attention 
for this topic and potential implications for TenneT have 
also been discussed.
Furthermore, the chairs of the SB and Audit Risk and 
Compliance Committee (ARCC) met with the Ministry of 
Finance in the yearly pre-General Shareholder’s Meeting to 
discuss topics related to the Integrated Annual Report. The 
chairs of the SB and Remuneration and Appointments 
Committee (RAC) also met with the shareholder in the yearly 
‘autumn’ meeting, to evaluate, among other things, the 
functioning and co-operation between the EB, SB and 
shareholder. The composition of the EB and SB, and the 
rotation schedule, were also on the agenda. The SB used 
the insights from these meetings to execute its supervisory 
– and advisory roles.
The SB met with several TenneT employees during the visit 
to the Diemen high voltage station. At the Annual 
Shareholder’s meeting, held in the Electrical Sustainable 
Power Lab (which is a co-operation between Delft University 
and TenneT), the shareholder and the SB had various 
dialogues with academics on the energy transition. And on 
the 19 May, in a visit to the Hollandse Kust Zuid offshore 
wind farms, SB members engaged with various 
stakeholders in the energy transition, such as the Ministry of 
Economic Affairs and Climate, wind farm owners, 
contracting partners from TenneT and NGO’s.
8. Remuneration and Appointments Committee
The RAC met nine times in 2022, most of the times virtually 
except for the yearly performance dialogues with EB 
members, that were held in person. One RAC meeting was 
incorporated in a SB meeting (therefore, all SB members 
were present).

The RAC paid special attention, among others, to the 
following subjects in preparation of the SB dialogues and 
decisions to be taken: Management Team Review with a 
focus on adequate internal Director/ EB potential and 
diversity; results of the employee engagement survey and 
action plan; ratio internal/ external employees and 
outsourcing.
Furthermore, the RAC has been busy preparing the external 
search for two new supervisory directors from mid-2023. 
At the time of publication of the Integrated Annual Report, 
this search is still ongoing. The RAC also spent time 
reviewing and approving a number of ancillary activities 
of EB and SB members. The two RAC members with an 
enhanced recommendation right by the works council met 
regularly with the works council, where safety and workload 
were important recurring themes. In November, the full SB 
met with the works council for a plenary dialogue on the 
energy market developments.
The RAC consists of Ms L. Griffith (chair RAC; member with 
an enhanced OR-recommendation right), Mr A. van der 
Touw and Mr S. van Els (member with an enhanced OR-
recommendation right). All RAC meetings were attended by 
Director People and the CEO.
9. Strategic Investment Committee
The SIC met six times in 2022. Two SIC meetings were 
incorporated in a SB meeting (implying that all SB members 
were present). Focus points of the SIC, in preparation of the 
SB dialogues and decisions to be taken, included: safety, 
security of supply, investment proposals and reports, 
standardisation, innovation and national security. The SIC 
especially welcomed TenneT’s new standardised 2 GW 
programme for the Dutch and German offshore grid 
connection systems, which enables TenneT to remain a 
customer of choice for a limited number of suppliers, make 
use of synergy effects and to operate and maintain the 
offshore platforms in a more efficient way. In 2022, the SIC 
recommended as much as 39 investment proposals with a 
total value of EUR 36.7 billion to the SB, which approved 
these. Also discussed several times in the SIC was the 
Asset Chain Initiative, which aims to drastically simplify the 
entire chain of project approvals while giving more attention 
to portfolio dialogues, e.g. at industry cluster level. This 
initiative requires close coordination with the shareholder 
and will be further pursued in 2023. Each year, one of the 
SIC meetings is attended by the external auditor for a better 
understanding of the strategic direction and the choices 
made and a good view on the thoroughness of the 
discussions leading to an effective control by the SIC.
The SIC consists of Mr S. van Els (chair SIC), Ms. E. Schöne 
and Ms. E. Kairisto. All SIC meetings were attended by both 
COOs.
10. Audit-, Risk and Compliance Committee
The ARCC met five times in 2022; two meetings were 
incorporated in a SB meeting (implying that all SB members 
attended). In preparation of the SB dialogues and decisions 
to be taken, the ARCC’s main attention points were (among 
others) the Integrated Annual Report and the Half-Year 
Report, as well as the quarterly Financing Reports and 
Integrated Audit, Risk and Control and Compliance and 
Integrity Reports, the update of the Internal Audit Charter, 
the Internal Audit Plan 2023, TenneT’s Ten Year Investment 
Forecast and Equity need, the Integrated Planning and 
Performance 2023-2025, the Financing Plan, TenneT’s 
credit rating, ESG reporting, legal procedures and IT 
security. All reports by the external auditor were also 
discussed in depth. Internal and external audit findings were 
a continuous point of attention and the ARCC noted that 
with better procedures in place these are expected to be 
resolved quicker or planned with more realistic deadlines. 
With effect from August 2022, TenneT has appointed a 
Director of Audit, Risk and Compliance, the ARCC was 
involved in this appointment and appreciates the 
strengthening of leadership and more integrated view of 
these areas.
The ARCC consists of Ms. E. Kairisto (chair ARCC), Mr. A. 
van der Touw and Ms. E. Schöne. All ARCC meetings were 
attended by the CFO, the CEO, the Head Internal Audit and 
the external auditor.
11. Management Letter external auditor
TenneT’s external auditor, Deloitte, stated in its management 
letter that it has not, considering other (mitigating) controls, 
determined any of the control deficiencies to be significant, 
neither individually nor in the aggregate.
Deloitte is of the opinion that within TenneT clear, logical and 
repetitive signals from management – such as internal 
training programmes, meetings, formal and informal 
conversations with employees, newsletters and work 
instructions – promote a corporate culture that appreciates 
and rewards integrity and ethical conduct. The overall view 
of the state of the internal control environment is that 
TenneT has a well-established internal control environment 
in the financial risk area and is working to strengthen in 
other areas.

As in any large and changing organisation, there are also 
improvement areas and recommendations. The 2022 
interim procedures have not resulted in new observations 
around internal control. For several findings raised in prior 
years, TenneT has made improvements in its processes 
leading to a reduction of the risks associated with the 
respective observations; for other findings it was noted that 
TenneT aims to have attention for all IT deficiencies raised in 
order to have these remediated more speedily by 
structurally addressing these going forward.
The ARCC and SB will keep monitoring the improvement 
areas and recommendations identified by Deloitte.
12. Strategy
Due to the war in the Ukraine and its impact on energy 
markets, the energy transition and energy security, the SB 
has had several dialogues on the execution of TenneT’s 
strategy, which was sharpened to meet the amended 
societal and political demands. It was noted that TenneT’s 
strategy will be re-evaluated in 2024 with shareholder 
consultation, for which the first steps will be taken in 2023. 
The SB will remain actively involved in TenneT’s strategy 
calibrations and in the re-evaluation.
13. Permanent Education Sessions
Permanent Education sessions were held on the following 
topics: TenneT investments in view of the increased Dutch 
and German climate ambitions and political landscape; high 
voltage installations and safety; the impact of the war in 
Ukraine on both the EU electricity system and on TenneT 
and how TenneT ensures it is prepared for any contingency; 
as well as an update on ESG reporting. Furthermore, the 
SB members were invited to participate in TenneT’s Annual 
Energy Market Update and the TenneT summit event in 
Brussels with an online dialogue with the European 
Commission's executive vice-president European Green 
Deal, Frans Timmermans.
14. Integrated reporting and audit
In 2022, the SB discussed the financial statements for the 
financial year 2021. This dialogue was prepared by the 
ARCC, and the respective meeting was preceded by the 
regular meeting between the ARCC and external auditor 
without EB members nor the Company Secretary being 
present to ensure a free dialogue. The SB reviewed the 
2021 Integrated Annual Report, the Half-Year Report as well 
as the internal quarterly reports. Furthermore, it discussed 
the independent auditor’s reports, results from internal risk 
and control assessments, the 2023 budget and the 
Integrated Performance Plan 2023-2025.
For the IAR 2022, the materiality analysis was validated by 
both the EB and the SB according to the Global 
Reporting Initiative Standards (GRI). In concurrence with the 
IAR 2021, the following four topics are considered the most 
material impacts for TenneT:
• Safety;
• Securing supply today and tomorrow;
• Driving the energy transition;
• Financial Health.
15. Financial statements
In 2022, the SB examined the Integrated Annual Report 
2021, the financial statements 2021, the Green Finance 
Report 2021, the independent auditor’s report, the 
assurance report of the independent auditor related to 
non-financial information, the interim report/management 
letter and the audit results report issued by TenneT’s 
external auditor. The ARCC prepared and advised on these 
documents. As a result, the SB endorsed the documents 
and recommended that the General Meeting of Shareholders 
adopt the financial statements. The SB recommended that 
the General Meeting of Shareholders discharge the EB 
members from liability for its management of the company 
and release the SB from liability for its supervision over the 
year 2021, both of which took place. 
16. Inclusion and diversity
Based on TenneT’s ambition, the company strives for an 
inclusive and diverse workforce that contributes to a range 
of skills, knowledge and experience, and to new 
approaches and ideas for a more efficient way of working. 
Diversity has been discussed in the RAC and SB in relation 
to the management team review for all Directors and the 
leaders reporting to the Directors. Diversity is also an 
important element in the search criteria for the two SB 
members that started in 2022.
The RAC noted that although the target for female hires 
(30%) was met in 2022, the target for international inflow 
(10%) has unfortunately not been fully met. The activities on 
providing a (temporary) workplace for refugee talent are 
highly valued. The RAC also appreciates the way TenneT 
once again managed to attract and onboard more than 
1,190 new employees in 2022.
The RAC and SB will keep monitoring diverse hiring as well 
as encouraging and living an inclusive culture.

17. Self-evaluation
In 2022, the SB conducted its self-evaluation under the 
guidance of an external board room consultant. The main 
points of attention were:
• TenneT’s growth challenge: the building projects and 
related investments are in control, but what does it mean 
for future maintenance, operations, governance, IT and 
HR. The SB resolved to discuss certainties, probabilities, 
and especially uncertainties and dilemmas regarding 
TenneT’s exponential growth, monitoring these both on a 
project/programme level and ‘zooming out’ for the bigger 
picture.
• The aim to spend more time on relationships with 
external stakeholders (including the shareholder) and 
internal stakeholders (including Dutch and German works 
councils) as well as on long term value creation: 
capitalise the assets, what can TenneT do with data and 
capabilities, what is happening in areas of innovation.
These topics will be on the SB- and committee agendas for 
2023.
Key positive notes were:
• That the SB operates in an effective manner. The SB 
functions well; expertise and profiles are complementary 
and diverse, and team spirit and commitment are strong.
• There is also great appreciation for the chair, who brings 
broad expertise and experience and sets the right tone 
for open and fruitful dialogue, and for the functioning of 
the three SB committees.
Thanks
The SB appreciates the excellent results over the year 2022, 
which could not have been reached without the hard work 
and noticeable drive and joy of everyone working for 
TenneT. The SB thanks the employees of TenneT for this 
commitment. Furthermore, the SB would like to thank the 
Executive Board as well as the company secretary, Ancella 
Anssems, for her advice and constant support during 2022.

Remuneration policy
TenneT’s remuneration policy primarily aims to offer remuneration at a level that will attract 
and retain qualified and capable statutory directors (including those who come from within 
the organisation), being Executive Board members (hereafter: EB). This also applies to 
Supervisory Board members (hereafter: SB). The remuneration policy meets the best-practice 
provisions on remuneration as defined in the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. Since all of 
the shares in TenneT are held by the Dutch State, TenneT’s remuneration policy falls within 
the scope of the 2022 State Participations Policy (‘Nota Deelnemingenbeleid Rijksoverheid 
2022’, published 1 July 2022). 
TenneT’s revised remuneration policy has been approved 
by the Shareholder and is effective as of January 2020. It is 
also in line with the 2022 State Participations Policy The 
most important elements of the current remuneration policy 
are described below.
Employment market reference group
Remuneration for the statutory directors of TenneT has been 
set using a benchmark, a comparison with organisations 
competing in the same business and employment markets 
as TenneT. These organisations include:
• International transmission system operators (TSOs);
• Operators of infrastructure;
• Installation/engineering companies;
• Building companies;
• Financial institutions.
The outcome of this benchmark showed a substantially 
higher remuneration level than TenneT’s current level of 
remuneration, which has been set by the Shareholder in 
line with the remuneration policy as of January 2020 and 
includes ‘equal pay’, regardless of gender or nationality.
The Supervisory Board reviews the remuneration policy for 
statutory directors once every four years. The Supervisory 
Board may resolve to do this as well in case of important 
policy changes, changes in Shareholder structure or 
ownership and changes in the labour market. Such 
changes will be aligned with and submitted to the 
Shareholder for approval.
Remuneration norm
The moment the Supervisory Board appoints a new 
statutory director it applies the remuneration policy as 
approved by the Shareholder. For 2022, this limit of the 
fixed remuneration, excluding pension and other 
allowances, was set at EUR 423,132 for TenneT’s Chief 
Executive Officer (CEO). The fixed remuneration of the other 
EB members (CFO and both COO’s) has been capped at 
90% of the remuneration of the CEO. The Supervisory 
Board applies the principle of equal pay to the remuneration 
policy for the statutory directors.
If, in the opinion of the Supervisory Board, the 
maximum remuneration as required by the Shareholder 
leads to unacceptable risks to the organisation because 
no suitable candidates can be found to fulfil the role of 
statutory director, the Supervisory Board shall consult 
the Shareholder.
The Supervisory Board decides on the annual increase 
in salary. If the remuneration of a statutory director has 
reached its maximum, further increases will be limited to 
the structural increments as agreed upon in the collective 
labour agreement which is applicable to all Dutch TenneT 
employees. Ms. Freitag and Mr. Meyerjürgens, whilst being 
based in Germany both have a Dutch labour agreement 
with TenneT.
Service agreement and compensation for early 
termination
In principle, with effect from 2017, employment contracts 
– with the exception of internal appointments – are 
concluded for a fixed term of four years. In the event that 
the employment contract is terminated prior to the expiry 
date, TenneT pays a maximum of one year’s salary as a 
termination compensation, unless the statutory director 
resigns voluntarily or the termination is the result of his or 
her actions. As an exception to our policy, agreed with the 
Shareholder, Ms. Freitag will also receive this termination 
compensation if she will not be employed for a second term 
at the initiative of TenneT.

Pensions
The retirement age of statutory directors is based on the 
statutory pension age for Dutch contracts for statutory 
directors based in the Netherlands. The retirement age 
of statutory directors based in Germany is based on the 
statutory pension age as applicable in Germany. Statutory 
directors participate in the regular pension scheme of the 
country in which they are covered for social insurance.
The Netherlands based statutory directors participate in 
a pension arrangement as defined in the collective labour 
agreement and as applicable for all employees in the 
Netherlands. The employer and employee contribution for 
the statutory directors follow the same rules as applicable to 
all other employees. Dutch pension regulations define the 
pensionable salary up to the fiscal maximum of 
EUR 114,866 (gross pension, 2022).
The statutory directors based in the Netherlands receive 
the same compensation as TenneT employees with an 
income above the fiscal maximum pension salary. The 
compensation is based on the fiscally allowed age-
dependent premium percentages up to fiscal maximum 
pension salary. 
German based statutory directors participate in the regular 
pension scheme (‘Beitragsplan’) or any other pension 
scheme that such statutory director may have already 
been entitled to.
In Germany TenneT currently has two pension schemes. 
For employees starting after 1 April 2008 Pension scheme 
2008 is applicable. Mr. Meyerjürgens joined TenneT’s TSO 
GmbH predecessor E.ON Netz GmbH on 1 March 2003. 
At that time a company pension based on the pension 
scheme 2001 was provided to him. Mr. Meyerjürgens kept 
participating in his pension scheme. For Ms. Freitag the 
Pension scheme 2008 is applicable. Further reverence is 
made to note 23 of the consolidated financial statements.
Other allowances and secondary benefits
The total remuneration package for statutory directors 
includes an allowance for necessary out-of-pocket 
expenses, the use of a lease car (of a type comparable 
to those provided to statutory directors of similar 
organisations) including possible private use, accident and 
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, and thirty days 
paid leave per annum. Sign-on bonuses and recruitment 
incentive payments are not applicable for statutory directors. 
Secondary benefits also include a nominal contribution 
towards health insurance premiums and the choice of other 
flexible individualised benefits, such as converting holiday 
allowance into extra leave hours. Most of these benefits are 
applicable to all TenneT employees, working under the 
Dutch collective labour agreement. The company does not 
extend any loans, loan guarantees or advances against 
future earnings to any statutory director.
Taxes
TenneT and the Dutch Tax Authorities reached a tax 
settlement on the allocation of wage and income taxes to 
the Netherlands and Germany. Part of this tax settlement 
led to double taxation for Ms. Van Beek, accepted as part 
of the agreement. TenneT shall fully indemnify, hold 
harmless and compensate statutory directors against all 
claims, demands, actions, suits, damages, liabilities, losses, 
settlements, judgments, costs and expenses (including but 
not limited to reasonable attorney’s fees and costs), which 
arise out of or relate to any act or omission of TenneT in 
relation to the double taxation claim. As a result statutory 
directors will not have a disadvantage of the international 
allocation of their remuneration, nor will there be a gain 
advantage from the advancing arrangement with TenneT, 
since it will be settled afterwards.
Next to that a Mutual Agreement Procedure is requested on 
behalf of Ms. Van Beek, Mr. Jager (as former statutory 
director) and Mr. Voorhorst (as former statutory director) 
between the competent Dutch and German authorities 
based on Article 25 of the bilateral tax treaty concluded 
between the Netherlands and Germany (2012) for the tax 
years 2018 and 2019.
(Re-)Appointment of EB and SB members
TenneT naturally adheres to the (re)appointment process of 
both EB and SB members. Both EB as well as SB 
members are appointed for a term of four years and can be 
re-appointed for a second term of four years. In well-
motivated cases, EB and SB members may subsequently 
be reappointed twice for a term of two years. So the total 
maximum period for both EB and SB members is 12 years.

Fixed remuneration
In accordance with the indexation for employees as 
determined by the Collective Labour Agreement for TenneT, 
the salaries of all statutory directors have been increased by 
3.1% as of May 2022 and a 1.2% one-off payment has 
been paid. The Supervisory Board sets and evaluates 
performance targets for each statutory director on an 
annual basis.
Pension cost
The pensions of all Dutch statutory directors are 
administered by the ABP Pension Fund. The pension 
accrual is based on an average pay system up to the fiscal 
maximum (gross pension). With respect to the fixed 
remuneration exceeding the fiscal maximum, the Dutch 
statutory directors may participate in a net pension system. 
As explained above, the pension of the German statutory 
directors is based on actuarial calculations in line with 
IAS19. The amount is equal to the yearly service costs. 
Other allowances and secondary benefits
All statutory directors have a company car available to 
them. The value of the private use is part of the Other 
allowances as shown in the table. The company does not 
reimburse its statutory directors for any personal income tax 
consequence resulting from the private use of leased cars.
For Dutch statutory directors the secondary benefits 
as shown in the remuneration table, include a contribution 
to health insurance and a budget for flexible terms of 
employment. Each statutory director received an allowance 
for necessary out-of-pocket expenses, of EUR 2,196 a year. 
This allowance is not included in the remuneration table as it 
is a compensation of expenses incurred and hence not 
considered a remuneration component.
The total remuneration paid to the statutory directors is 
reconciled to and further disclosed in note 4 of the 
consolidated financial statements.
Remuneration ratio
The remuneration ratio CEO to employees is measured by 
comparing the total remuneration, including fixed salary, 
variable remuneration and pension benefits of the CEO with 
the median of all other employees. The remuneration ratio 
CEO to senior management is measured by comparing the 
CEO's annual total compensation with the median annual 
total compensation of the Senior Leadership Team (SLT). 
The SLT consists of 21 Directors, all direct reports to the 
EB. The remuneration ratio of the highest paid employee to 
employees is measured by comparing the annual total 
compensation, with the median of all other employees. As 
of this reporting year the highest paid employee to median 
of all other employees is a new ratio calculation. That and 
the fact that the calculation base changed makes up for the 
fact that the remuneration ratio differ to what was reported 
in the IAR of 2021 and 2020. The cost components have 
been reassessed and next to that the following changes 
were made. Employees with a parttime employment 
contract are not recalculated to one fulltime equivalent. 
The same is applied to employees joining TenneT during the 
course of the year, their remuneration is not recalculated to 
twelve months. 
2022 2021 2020
Remuneration ratio CEO to median of employees 5.9 5.8 6.2
Remuneration ratio highest paid employee to median of employees 1) 6.8 7.0 7.0
Remuneration ratio to median of SLT 1.5 1.9 2.1
1)  Mr. Meyerjürgens is the highest paid individual, due to pension entitlements.

Corporate governance structure
TenneT's corporate governance structure comprises the 
Executive Board, the Supervisory Board and the General 
Meeting of Shareholders. Additionally, our internal Audit, 
Risk & Internal Control and Compliance & Integrity unit and 
external auditor play an important role in this structure.
Executive Board
The Executive Board of TenneT Holding B.V. has four 
statutory directors. The Executive Board members have 
joint authority to represent the company. Each board 
member also holds limited individual power of attorney. 
Three members of the Executive Board of TenneT Holding B.V. 
are managing directors of TenneT TSO B.V., three members 
of the Executive Board are managing directors of TenneT 
TSO GmbH and one of these three members is managing 
director of TenneT Offshore GmbH.
The Executive Board is responsible for the management of 
the company, which includes regulated and non-regulated 
activities.
 
 
Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board of TenneT Holding B.V. supervises 
the policies, management and the general affairs. It carries 
out its duties in the interests of the company and its 
stakeholders, and also takes into account relevant aspects 
of corporate social responsibility. Supervisory Board 
decision-making is supported by the Strategic Investment 
Committee, the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee 
and the Remuneration and Appointments Committee. 
TenneT has a two-tier board structure, as specified in 
the Electricity Act.
All information about the Supervisory Board (such as its 
rules and rotation schedule) is available on our corporate 
website.
General Meeting of Shareholders
All shares in TenneT's capital are held by the Dutch state, 
which is represented by the Ministry of Finance. Under the 
Electricity Act, only the Dutch state may hold voting 
interests in the company. A General Meeting of Shareholders 
is held within six months after the end of each financial year. 
As a transmission system operator, TenneT plays an important role in society. We believe in 
having a solid governance structure, effective oversight and a transparent accountability to all 
stakeholders. To that end, we comply with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code (hereafter: 
the Code), insofar as it is applicable.

The General Meeting of Shareholders discharged the 
Executive Board and Supervisory Board members from 
liability from their respective activities in the year 2022. 
Other shareholder meetings are held as and when deemed 
necessary by the Executive Board, Supervisory Board or 
the Shareholder.
Audit, Risk & Internal Control and Compliance 
& Integrity
As of 1 August 2022, the Audit, Risk & Internal Control and 
Compliance & Integrity (ARC) unit was established bringing 
together the teams of Internal Audit, Risk & Internal Control 
and Compliance & Integrity. The integration provides 
benefits in terms of a single point of contact and opportunity 
for more alignment and synergy. The resulting limitations to 
the independence of the Internal Audit team are managed 
through the outsourcing of periodic audits on the Risk & 
Internal Control and Compliance & Integrity teams to a third 
party. The ARC unit provides an integrated report on a 
quarterly basis towards the Executive Board and the Audit, 
Risk & Compliance Committee, who advises the 
Supervisory Board. 
The ARC unit is led by the Director ARC, who reports 
hierarchically to the CFO. The management of Risk & 
Internal Control and management of Compliance & Integrity 
report to the Director ARC, who also manages Internal 
Audit. Both the Director ARC and the Head Compliance & 
Integrity have a second ‘dotted reporting line’ to the CEO.
In line with the good governance practice of the three lines 
model by the Institute of Internal Auditors, the management 
of the organisation is responsible for directing and leading 
activities to achieve the objectives of the organization. 
It establishes and maintains appropriate structures and 
processes for the management of activities, including 
governance, risk management and internal control. The 
teams Risk & Internal Control and Compliance & Integrity 
train, advise and support the organisation in their field of 
expertise. The team of Risk & Internal Control facilitates the 
company-level management systems for risks and internal 
controls. The Compliance & Integrity team facilitates the 
company-level management systems for prevention, 
detection and responding to risks related to Compliance & 
Integrity, including data privacy. Compliance & Integrity has 
representatives in both the Netherlands and Germany.

The team of Internal Audit provides independent assurance 
and advice services regarding the adequacy of governance, 
risk management and control arrangements across the 
company. Internal Audit drafts an audit plan involving the 
Executive Board, the Audit, Risk & Compliance Committee 
and the external auditor. The audit plan is submitted to the 
Executive Board, and then to the Supervisory Board, for 
approval. The functioning of Internal Audit is assessed by 
the Executive Board and supervised by the Supervisory 
Board, advised by the Audit, Risk & Compliance Committee.
External auditor
The General Meeting of Shareholders has the power to 
appoint external auditors to audit the financial statements 
prepared by the Executive Board. These auditors report to 
the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board, and their 
findings are presented in an independent auditor's report, 
an assurance report, a management letter and an audit 
review results report. The General Meeting of Shareholders 
appointed Deloitte Accountants B.V. as TenneT's external 
auditor as per 1 January 2020. The Executive Board, 
Supervisory Board, shareholder and Deloitte have agreed to 
prolong the contract of Deloitte for another two year period 
in accordance with the prolongation options in the contract. 
The prolongation is for the financial reporting periods 2024 
and 2025.
The functioning of the external auditor is supervised by the 
Supervisory Board, advised by the Audit, Risk & 
Compliance Committee, considering observations of the 
Executive Board.
The external auditor attends all meetings of the Audit, Risk 
& Compliance Committee. It also attends Supervisory Board 
meetings when the independent auditor's report on the 
financial statements is discussed and the financial 
statements are approved. Furthermore, in 2022 the external 
auditor attended one meeting of the Strategic Investments 
Committee for information purposes.
Deviations from the Dutch Corporate 
Governance Code
Certain principles and best-practice provisions in the Code 
do not apply to TenneT. The reasons why and to what 
extent TenneT decided not to or could not adopt these 
particular principles and best-practice provisions are 
explained below:
Chapter 2:
2.1.3, 3.1.3: Not applicable: no Executive Committee has 
been established at TenneT. 
2.3.8: Not applicable: no delegated Supervisory Board 
member is employed by TenneT. 
2.3.2: If the Supervisory Board has more than four 
members, the Code stipulates that the board shall appoint 
from among its members an Audit Committee, a 
Remuneration Committee, and a Selection and 
Appointments Committee. The TenneT Supervisory Board 
has combined the tasks of the latter two committees into a 
Remuneration and Appointments Committee. 
2.7.5 - 2.8.3, 3.3.2, 3.3.3: Not applicable: these provisions 
do not apply to TenneT because it only has one shareholder, 
being the Dutch state.
Chapter 4:
Regarding paragraph 4.1 TenneT complies with the Code. 
Paragraphs 4.2 – 4.4 are not applicable to TenneT because 
it only has one shareholder, namely the Dutch state.
Chapter 5:
Given TenneT’s two-tier board structure, this chapter is not 
applicable.

Compliance and Integrity
A culture of Compliance and Integrity is essential for TenneT’s sustainable success. Therefore, 
we strive to prevent and - at an early stage - identify and respond to compliance and integrity 
risks that could jeopardise the implementation of the company's strategy and objectives and 
lead to economic and/or legal consequences, as well as reputational damage.
Especially in view of the high annual investment volume, 
we consider the compliance risk increasing. In 2022 the 
Compliance and Integrity Team (ARC-COI) became part of 
the new ARC Unit (Audit, Risk & Compliance Unit). The 
Director of the ARC Unit reports to the CFO.
Our Code of Conduct (updated in 2022) with our Guiding 
Principles ‘Ownership’, ‘Connection’, and ‘Courage’, and a 
number of compliance directives guide our employees to 
conduct business ethically and to comply with the 
applicable laws and regulations. All employees are 
requested to follow e-learnings on Code of Conduct topics 
and all new employees participate in compliance trainings 
as part of their onboarding program.
Data privacy
In the course of its business activities, TenneT regularly 
processes personal data. We use standardised processes 
to assess risks and protect the rights of data subjects. 
Compliance with external laws and regulations, as well as 
internal rules is ensured by the responsible specialist 
departments, which receive advice from the data protection 
team. Moreover, in each unit a Privacy Champion is the 
main point of contact for privacy matters. This liaison 
between the Privacy Champions and the Privacy team 
furthers two-way communication and to-the-point privacy 
advice by the Privacy team.
TenneT regularly reviews its processes for processing 
personal data and trains its employees to meet data 
protection requirements. External service providers are 
requested to sign data protection agreements.
Also within the new ARC Unit the independent function 
of the data protection officers is guaranteed.
Advice & reporting
ARC-COI advises the business on various compliance, 
integrity and data protection aspects and regularly reports 
to the TenneT Executive Board and the Audit, Risk and 
Compliance Committee of the Supervisory Board regarding 
such topics.
Various channels exist through which (potential) Code 
of Conduct violations, including compliance and data 
protection issues, can be reported. Moreover, a Speak up 
portal, which is operated by an external party, allows for 
(potential) Code of Conduct violations to be reported 
(anonymously).
Identified compliance risks are dealt with by the Compliance 
and Integrity Committee in its quarterly meetings. In 2022, 
no compliance incidents with a material impact were 
identified for TenneT. Material impact is defined in our risk 
matrix as a breach that has a significant adverse effect on 
TenneT’s reputation and/or financial position.

Corporate risk management and Internal control
Professional corporate risk management with integrated internal control processes are key 
throughout the organisation and result into effective risk-based decisions.
Corporate risk management and internal control 
framework
Risk Management continuously identifies risks, assesses 
severity of risks, prioritises risks, implements risk responses 
and maintains a portfolio view. It reports the identified 
uncertainties, opportunities or control issues proactively on 
a quarterly basis towards the Executive Board, Supervisory 
Board and Senior Leaders. The principles of corporate risk 
management and internal control should be taken into 
account in all activities performed at and for TenneT.
Corporate risk management facilitates top-down and 
bottom-up dialogues, workshops, detailed analyses and 
general trainings on risk awareness at all levels within 
TenneT. The resulting outcome provides management 
insights to take risk-based decisions that support the 
achievement of objectives set at all organisational levels.
As corporate risk management the focus and key objectives 
are to:
• Identify events, assess the risk, formulate risk responses, 
inform and communicate, implement control activities 
and continuous monitoring;
• Establish and maintain a uniform risk management 
framework;
• Provide the required tools, framework and guidelines for 
risk based decision making;
• Transparent and uniform reporting based on the ISO and 
COSO framework.
As TenneT the corporate risk framework is structured into:
• Strategic Risk Management (SRM);
• Operational Risk Management (ORM);
• Project Risk Management (PRM);
• Risk and Portfolio management;
• Internal Control and Process Risk Management.
TenneT’s corporate risk management and internal control 
frameworks are based on ISO 31000 and COSO standards 
and are compliant with the requirements of applicable laws 
and regulations such as the Dutch Corporate Governance 
Code, the German Control and Transparency in Business 
Act and the German Accounting Law Reform Act.

Risk appetite
The amount of risk TenneT is willing to seek or accept in pursuit of its long-term objectives.
The Risk Appetite Statement 2022 sets the guidance and 
willingness for the activities conducted by TenneT in pursuit 
of its strategic objectives. The Executive Board together 
with the Senior Leadership Team reviews the Risk Appetite 
Statement annually to ensure that TenneT maintains a 
balance between risk and reward, relative to potential 
opportunities. In terms of the amount of risk that TenneT is 
willing to seek or accept, a differentiation is made between 
low risk appetite to high risk appetite. 
High Risk Appetite
Areas in which TenneT has a preference for disciplined 
risk-taking because we have determined that the potential 
upside benefits outweigh the potential disadvantages.
Medium Risk Appetite
Areas in which TenneT must constantly strike a balance 
between potential upside benefits and potential downside 
aspects of a given decision.
Low Risk Appetite
Areas in which TenneT avoids risks, or acts to minimise or 
eliminate the likelihood that the risk will occur, because we 
have determined that the potential downside aspects are 
intolerable. These are areas in which we typically seek to 
maintain a very strong control environment.
In the sections below we depict the results which places 
each risk area on a risk-appetite scale that ranges from 
‘low’ to ‘medium’ to ‘high’:
Risk area Description Rationale
High Risk Appetite
Secure Supply 
Tomorrow
Planning and building a future-proof energy 
system today that provides security of 
supply tomorrow (e.g. Target Grid, 2GW 
Program, Sued(Ost)Link, hydrogen solution) 
while supporting a reduction in CO2 and SF6 
emissions.
We want to stimulate the market by entering into innovative 
partnerships and will apply cutting-edge technology to 
develop adequate responses to some of the most vexing 
challenges of the energy transition, as well as the Climate 
Agreement. We accept that some approaches could fail to 
fulfil on their promise.
Natural  
Disasters
Asset protection beyond what is financially 
insured against natural disasters such as 
flooding, cyclones, wildfire, extreme heat and 
earthquakes.
We continue to assess the impact of natural disasters on our 
grid, and accept that unforeseen events impacting our grid, 
today or in 30 years from now, can arise that we have not 
forecasted or catered for.

Risk area Description Rationale
Medium Risk Appetite
Asset Security Ensuring the protection of our assets against 
physical threats, such as attacks on sub-sea 
cables, onshore connections, substations, pylons 
or theft of valuable materials (e.g. copper).
We continually assess best practices to control the risk 
of protecting our assets from theft and intruders while 
recognising that a 100% protection is not possible. Not all 
measures might always be as effective as anticipated and 
not all expected costs justify the level of protection needed.
Biodiversity Protect the landscape and promote biodiversity 
around our substations, onshore connections 
and offshore projects.
We will continue to improve our projects to limit impact on 
nature and to improve the quality of animal life who were 
affected by construction or are affected by operating our 
assets. We recognise that sometimes decisions need to be 
made, in favour of building the grid, that negatively affect 
biodiversity. 
Procurement & 
Logistics
To have all required materials, supplies and 
services available on time and in asked quality.
We will make reasonable efforts to invest in supplier 
relationships and to secure critical supplies and services 
on time and in agreed quality for large projects while 
balancing supply chain constraints due to overall tight 
market conditions. 
Staffing To enable accommodating up to 10,000 
employees (internal and contractors) before 
2026 to achieve our future projects. 
We will continually assess best practices in the industry 
for attracting, retaining and developing talent, including 
seeking flexibilities for hiring and compensating staff, 
while recognising that growing too rapidly could inhibit the 
organisations agility and responsiveness.
Reputation and 
Media
To maintain public, political and stakeholder 
trust in order to achieve TenneT’s objectives and 
responsibilities. 
We will balance traditional and social media to promote 
and amplify the goals and results of TenneT. However, we 
must recognise the inherent risk of commutations taken 
out of context intendedly or unintendedly or not adhering 
to the same voice and message towards our external 
partners.
Safeguard our 
Financial Health
To maintain our credit ratings and have a 
sustainable balance between equity and debt.
We use a variety of processes and controls to continuously 
monitor and manage project capital expenditures, 
reporting, and the delivery of ancillary services, recognising 
that raising more debt is a quick way to finance our large 
projects, but it can negatively impact our credit ratings. 
We address OPEX growth before it leads to inefficiencies. 
Low Risk Appetite
Operational  
Safety
Operational or constructional hazards resulting 
into one or multiple injuries or fatalities.
We endeavour to prevent unsafe situations that could 
endanger others, including our employees, contractors or the 
local community. We act on the basis of the highest safety 
standards in our sector.
Ethics, 
Compliance & 
Human Rights
Working with business partners who do 
not share the same ethics and compliance 
principles or are situated in countries with lower 
human right standards.
We adopt a cautious stance for compliance by promoting and 
enforcing compliance with all laws, procedures and internal 
standards. At times we assume a degree of calculated risk 
of working with (sub)contractors in countries with lower 
human right standards that are essential to support our large 
projects. 
Secure Supply 
Today
To ensure that demand and supply of electricity 
– from renewable and traditional sources - are 
balanced.
We continue to ensure the security of supply of electricity 
transport, and connection of new customers, always 
taking into account the limited availability of interconnected 
electricity in Europe, congestion management or the planning 
complexity of dispatching.
IT Technology Events or circumstances that could potentially 
improve or compromise the processing, 
stability, capacity, performance or resilience.
We will act to minimise any weaknesses that could disrupt 
business operations, affect productivity, heighten the risk 
of fraud or threaten the security of information. We will 
work to avoid unplanned downtime that could result in lost 
productivity or costs to recover data.
Cyber Security Resilience against cyber threats or malware 
infestations affecting (partial) loss of control or 
power outages.
We have adopted a cautious approach to cyber risk. 
We reduce risk as much as possible by proactively and 
continuously mitigating malware and other intrusions, 
preventing unauthorised disclosure of sensitive data, and 
mitigating vulnerabilities in our security protocols, while 
recognising that attacks occur daily.

To provide a single structured risk overview of all the risks and opportunities identified 
by TenneT, three risk tables have been introduced. A strategic risk table based on the four 
strategic pillars another on regulatory risks and lastly climate-related risks. Please note that 
the risks mentioned in these tables are also presented earlier in the section ‘Our Performance’. 
Strategic pillar Risks Mitigating measures
Secure supply 
today and 
tomorrow
• The nitrogen emission ruling by the Council of State 
in the Netherlands could significantly delay in short 
term 25 projects (planning and operating) by 1 to 
2 years and midterm affecting 100 projects with a 
delay between 6 to 12 months. The on average 
10 year licensing and permitting process required to 
get approval to start construction, reduces TenneT's 
ability to act in a timely manner on our investment 
plans and promises.
• Not able to connect customers to our grid on time 
due to unavailability of sustainable grid capacity.
• Major suppliers are unable to deliver critical supplies 
(services and materials) to schedule (or at all) as they 
experience financial difficulties, insolvency or capacity 
constraints. 
• Our older assets require more maintenance work and 
present a growing logistical challenge and cost.
• The inflow of renewable energy requires congestion 
management to stabilise the grid resulting in higher 
cost for society due to the redispatch costs. 
• Breach of security, attack or malware infestation 
potentially intensified due to the armed conflict on 
European soil.
• Managing a growing portfolio of large projects – due 
to growth of onshore and offshore projects 
• The potential usage of new technologies in our assets 
could cause unforeseen malfunctions and could 
require more focus on maintenance.
• Align with stakeholders and local communities first 
about their area investment plans and legislation such 
that TenneT can plan long-term investments 
accordingly.
• Action plan how to approach the increasing problem 
of customer connection demand in relation to grid 
capacity. 
• Investment in more efficient grid use e.g. increasing 
transport capacity via dynamic line rating under windy 
conditions. 
• Contract more redispatch capacity in neighboring 
countries.
• Periodical training system operations how to balance 
the grid under unlikely but high impact scenarios.
• Accelerate certification of new suppliers (e.g. in India); 
risk diversification of supplier specific country risk 
and dependency. 
• Simplifying organisational and decision-making 
processes to increase efficiency and flexibility in our 
maintenance programme.
• Continuation of effective monitoring and action-taking 
against physical or cyber security attacks, together 
with our strategic partners. 
• Usage of more project standardisations e.g. 2GW 
program.
Opportunities
• Growing political support to reduce permitting time enabling TenneT to build the required grid on time
• New technologies are becoming available to help TenneT to manage political expectations and to deliver on its 
climate targets such as SF6 gas, carbon emission and oil leakage. 
• Circularity of resources becomes more viable to reduce our footprint on for instance the usage of virgin copper.

Strategic pillar Risks Mitigating measures
Drive the 
energy 
transition
• Our strategic plans are complicated due to an 
increase of the national and European political 
ambition to become independent of Russian gas 
and early delivery on 2030 climate targets.
• Limited space is available to build and expand our 
grid. 
• A lack of societal acceptance of the energy transition 
could lead to an inability of realising our ambitions.
• Economic developments and high energy costs in 
Europe could influence the acceptance of costs 
associated with the energy transition.
• We are actively working with our contractors to make 
progress towards climate, circularity and nature 
ambitions.
• We aim to use an Environmental Cost Indicator (ECI) 
for evaluation purposes, based on the methodology 
of a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).
Opportunities
• New technologies and European collaboration to foster cross-border solutions, multi-hubs, sector coupling, 
integrated decarbonisation and the construction of the North Sea Wind Power Hub
Energise our 
people and 
organisation
Risks Mitigating measures
• Not adhering to preventative or risk mitigating health 
and safety processes resulting in multiple severe 
incidents or fatalities. 
• TenneT faces ongoing difficulties to hire required 
resources for current / future operations due to tight 
labor conditions as well as internal turnover of staff 
and contractor personnel.
• We face a delicate balance, between growing 
responsibly and sustainably in a way that allows us 
to stay agile and productive. 
• Training is intensified to commit all stakeholders, 
making no difference between internal and 
contractors, to adhere to all safety regulations 
whether working at a construction site or at the office.
• Safety inclusion in tendering and supplier 
performance management.
• Implement various initiatives such as bias-trainings, 
publication of vacancies in other languages or starting 
international learning programs.
Opportunities
• Boosting our execution power through finding better ways of working together in a performance-oriented culture.
Safeguard 
our fnancial 
health
Risks Mitigating measures
• Lower regulatory rates of return on capital could 
diminish TenneT’s attractiveness for investors.
• Dependency on the regulatory framework, political 
commitments and society’s growing concern about 
the cost of energy increase the pressure on TenneT’s 
reimbursements. 
• Increasing OPEX electricity costs to balance the grid 
creates pressure on our reported financial result. 
• Exposure to credit risks or writeoffs if one or more of 
our partners get into financial trouble due to the 
expected economic recession in 2023. 
• The revenue cap is partially mitigated by an additional 
income stream on top of the revenue cap for specific 
investments.
• Application of active cost control and to strive for an 
efficient operation of our business as far as reasonably 
possible in order to avoid adverse effects from 
efficiency assessments of our regulators.
• Performance of regular credit checks of significant 
partners, if needed additional due diligence.
• Stress testing of hypothetical worst case scenarios 
and to address any potential high risk following from 
the analysis.
Opportunities
• Investments in green businesses and economies are increasingly favoured by large investors and banks  
(e.g. institutional).

Regulatory risks
Regulatory risk Risk-mitigating actions
General • Inability to meet increasing efficiency targets over time 
as imposed by incentive regulation, especially taking into 
account a strongly growing company and the need for 
significant investments in grid expansion, maintenance, 
operation as well as innovation.
• TenneT is unable to achieve a reasonable return on 
its invested capital as well as the full remuneration of 
operational costs as the regulated return continues 
to decline due to the low interest environment, the 
disallowance or only partial recognition of certain 
operational costs and stricter regulatory incentives.
• TenneT performs regular reviews of its processes and 
organisational structure, introduced lean management, 
carries out continuous improvement activities and 
automates its IT-related processes. TenneT also 
prepares make-or-buy decisions in its investment 
process to optimise value for money to society and 
conducts strategic dialogues with regulators (ACM, 
BNetzA, ACER), policymakers and industry partners/
suppliers to co-shape its future regulatory framework.
• TenneT’s strategy is to seek mutually acceptable results 
with regulatory stakeholders. However, if needed to 
protect pivotal strategic positions on solid legal grounds, 
legal action may be taken.
Europe • The ‘Clean Energy Package’ (CEP) entered into force. 
It requires amongst others that TSOs provide 70% of the 
total cross-border transmission capacity to the market, 
an amount difficult to achieve without extensive and 
costly redispatch activities.   
The German government introduced an action plan to 
gradually achieve this target by 31.12.2025. Delays in 
fulfilment of this plan by TenneT could lead to material 
financial penalties.   
Similarly, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs has 
issued an action plan to gradually achieve the 70% target 
by 1.1.2026, which also contains derogations for TenneT.
• Extreme power prices and increased redispatch volumes 
result in a significant increase of grid fees.
• In Germany TenneT keeps the capacity requirements 
along the ‘trajectory’ as defined in the national ‘action 
plan’. This means stepping up to full 70% using 
instruments such as coordinated redispatch and 
countertrade. 
• In the Netherlands, TenneT monitors compliance against 
the action plan, in particular also as to the conditions of 
the derogation. TenneT reports on issues to the ACM 
and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, if any.
• In Germany a subsidy was implemented to alleviate 
the impact of high grid fees for TSO clients. In the 
Netherlands a price cap is implemented on the energy 
bill (via suppliers). The price cap also covers the higher 
costs for grid operators as a result of the high costs for 
ancillary services.
The Netherlands 
 
• In accordance with ACMs method decision for the 
period 2022-2026 the risk free rate is ex post settled. 
This ex post settlement shields TenneT from the current 
interest rate increase in the market as TenneT’s revenues 
are adjusted to reflect the current conditions on the 
financial markets. TenneT is however still exposed to 
weakening cash flows when the interest rates decline. 
Consequently TenneT advocated that the methodology 
contains a floor for the risk-free rate.
• According to the decision by the ACM, TenneT’s cost 
efficiency level will decline from 97.9% in 2021 to 89.1% 
in 2025, impacting the next regulatory period with 
decreasing revenue.
• TenneT is appealing against the efficiency determination 
by the ACM and supports the appeal of Netbeheer 
Nederland regarding the determination on the WACC.
Germany  • The BNetzA decreased the rate of return on equity for 
the next regulatory period from 6.91% to 5.07% before 
corporate tax. This will have a significantly negative 
impact on TenneT’s cash flow and revenue as of 2024.  
The European Court of Justice decided that the German 
legal design of the regulatory framework must be changed 
in order to give the BNetzA more independence from 
political influences. It is yet unclear how far the degree 
of independence will reach with regard to parliamentary 
and legal checks and balances and how it will be 
implemented in a reliable and future-proof way in the 
regulatory framework. Furthermore, the independence 
of the regulator from national legislators may also affect 
the relationship of the ACM to the Ministry of Economic 
Affairs (EzK) in the Netherlands, as was announced in 
a press release by the ACM.
• TenneT together with other grid operators challenges 
the methodology used by the BNetzA on the return 
on equity determination and is appealing against this 
determination. 
• TenneT established an internal working group including 
colleagues from its regulatory, legal and political 
departments to accompany the political process. 
• TenneT engages, amongst others, in the German 
Association of Energy and Water Industry (BDEW) to 
support profound analysis and advocacy work within 
the network industry.
• TenneT engages in public and expert discussions 
and positions itself as a competent partner and trustful 
advisor to the regulators and policymakers.

Climate related risks and opportunities
The Taskforce for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures 
provides recommendations for companies to improve and 
increase the reporting of climate related financial 
information. We have followed up on its recommendations, 
including in our risk assessment process, and have 
identified the following climate related risks and 
opportunities for TenneT, which we clustered below. Please 
note that there might be some overlap with risks also being 
mentioned earlier in the report, but this is to provide one 
structured overview in this section. 
Climate related risks
Risks How might this affect TenneT? Risk mitigating actions
• Transition 
risks
• Policy and 
legal risks
• Policy and legal risks are related to our regulatory 
framework. Choices we make that can help society 
and us as a company to transition to a climate-neutral 
economy are subject to discussion with our regulator. 
Our regulatory framework is updated once every 5 years 
and this might pose a risk that if ambitions from 
governments in the areas we serve move faster than 
the spirit of the regulatory framework, this might be a 
constraining factor to drive the energy transition.
• We mitigate this by lobbying on national and European 
level, run pilot projects and present business cases and 
focus on those topics that promise the highest benefit 
for society, which are integration of power and 
hydrogen as well as flexibility and grid utilisation 
together with partners.
• Technology 
risk
• A risk of stranded assets might occur in case a new 
technology is developed if for instance the new 
technology is unable to communicate with the old 
technology. Or if the technology used by TenneT is not 
able to connect or communicate with the technology 
used by other TSOs.
• Mitigating actions include challenging the necessity of 
each investment and embrace other solutions, if those 
promise more societal value and actively work and 
invest in new technology as part of our strategy. Next to 
this, our approach regarding innovation aims to focus 
on the most important areas and implementing new 
technology as fast as possible, which reduces this risk.
• Market risk • Our market risks relate to dealing with the higher infeed 
of renewable energy sources and impacting the way we 
balance our grid and market prices. Renewable energy 
sources are more volatile and cannot easily be increased 
in case of a higher demand. Differences in market prices 
can lead to too high requests for energy at one location, 
e.g. Southern-Germany, where not all energy can be 
transmitted to the users. In such situations additional 
measures are required to balance the grid, such as 
redispatch.
• TenneT plans and builds DC-grid connections in 
Germany and interconnectors within Europe and we 
investigate the grid integration of green hydrogen and 
power grids as well as improving the quality of data 
to predict power production and consumption.
• Reputation 
risk
• A reputation risk could occur when we are unable to 
deliver on our strategic goal to drive the energy transition.  
Connected to this are the increasing ambitions of the 
governments in the areas we serve to meet these 
requirements. When realising our assets, we also have 
a reputational risk if there is a growing resistance from 
local communities and governments, if we do not 
engage with our stakeholders properly (‘not in my 
backyard’). Furthermore the overall cost of the energy 
transition is also a risk from a reputational perspective 
(affordability).
• To mitigate this risk we aim to communicate in an 
open and transparent fashion. Next to this, we invite 
stakeholders in the planning and approval process of 
projects to voice their opinion which we consider in, for 
instance, the final route of a certain project. We also aim 
to balance affordability, sustainability and security of 
supply in all our investment decisions. Further mitigation 
takes place through the usage of professional planning, 
project management and costs forecasting.
• Physical 
risks
• Acute • Acute risks are related to for instance extreme weather 
conditions that could impact our assets and supply 
chain.
• Acute weather conditions are mitigated during the 
design, construction and maintenance of our assets, 
such as the choice of location and the choice of 
materials. Regarding our supply chain, monitoring of 
suppliers and diversification are mitigating factors.
• Chronic • Chronic physical risks can relate to rising sea and ground 
water levels for instance, where our assets might be at a 
risk due to this.
• We monitor developments to gain more experience and 
insights related to the scenarios and effects. Examples 
include projects related to assets such as our Krimpen 
aan de IJssel substation and one of our pylons, which 
we both have elevated. TenneT insures all substations 
and buildings during construction and operation against 
risks from natural catastrophes. Pylons and overhead-
lines are not insured.

Climate related opportunities
Opportunities How might this affect TenneT?
• Resource efficiency • Increased decentralised power production and storage including self-balancing micro grids as well as 
electrolysers if they are correctly located can relieve high-voltage grids. Furthermore, DC-interconnectors 
enhance the transmission of power of very long distances and connect renewable power production and 
demands in different countries.
• Solutions related to flexibility help us to make smarter use of our grid. This might have a positive effect as 
this could lead to less grid expansion and therefore help us reduce the amounts of resources required to 
secure supply today and tomorrow.
• Energy source • TenneT is a leading investor in the energy transition and so we have been able to gain a vast amount of 
experience connecting renewable energy sources, such as offshore wind, to our grid. This experience helps 
us to further drive the energy transition together with partners and fulfil the future investment portfolio.
• Products and Services • Our project portfolio has significantly changed in order to meet national and European climate goals. Key 
projects are connecting offshore wind energy to our grid or to ensure that our onshore grid is prepared for 
a new energy future. The gathering and analysis of energy data may lead to new products and services 
provided by TSOs, such as Equigy.
• Markets • Strategies and objectives of financial institutes and banks provide opportunities for TenneT to attract 
sustainable financing at favourable terms and conditions by issuing green finance products to finance 
and refinance our investments in green infrastructure projects.
• Resilience • Trends in the society, like the electrification of mobility, result in higher demand on a stable grid and power 
supply. To ensure resilience, integration of power and gas grids is a vital alternative. Digitalisation using 
technologies like automatisation, robotics and block-chain will help to optimise grid utilisation while 
safeguarding a reliable supply of electricity.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

1 Basis for reporting
Basis for preparation
The accounting policies describe our approach to recognise and measure transactions and balance sheet items in our 
financial statements. Accounting policies, including new European Union (EU) endorsed accounting standards, amendments 
and interpretations, relating to the consolidated financial statements as a whole are described below. This section also 
provides general guidance regarding assumptions, estimates and judgements used in the preparation of the financial 
statements. A more detailed description of accounting policies and significant estimates related to specific reported amounts 
is presented in the respective notes. Only accounting policies that are deemed material are presented in these financial 
statements. We consider an item material if, in our view, it is likely to have an impact on the economic decisions of primary 
users of these financial statements. 
General
TenneT Holding B.V. and its subsidiaries are a leading electricity transmission system operator with activities in the 
Netherlands and a large part of Germany. In the Netherlands, our activities are conducted by TenneT TSO B.V. and its 
subsidiaries. In Germany, our activities are performed by TenneT GmbH & Co. KG and its subsidiaries.
The Dutch State owns the entire issued share capital of TenneT Holding B.V. Furthermore, TenneT Holding B.V. has issued 
hybrid securities which are deeply subordinated and are accounted for as part of equity attributable to equity holders of the 
Company. The registered office of TenneT Holding B.V. is located at Utrechtseweg 310, Arnhem, the Netherlands, with its 
statutory seat in Arnhem and a registration with the Dutch Commercial Register under number 09083317. 
These consolidated financial statements of TenneT Holding B.V. and its subsidiaries (hereafter referred to as ‘TenneT’, ‘the 
Company’ or ‘the Group’) for the year ended 31 December 2022 were prepared by our Executive Board and authorised for 
issuance in accordance with a resolution of the Supervisory Board on 8 March 2023. The financial statements will be 
submitted for adoption at the General Meeting of Shareholders. These consolidated financial statements have been audited 
by Deloitte Accountants B.V.
Basis for preparation
These consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union (IFRS) and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. The company financial statements for 
TenneT Holding B.V. are prepared in accordance with the provisions of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis. The going concern basis presumes that the 
Group has adequate resources to remain in operation and that the Executive Board intends it to do so, for at least one year 
from the date of the end of the reporting period.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, unless described otherwise in the accounting 
policy of a balance sheet position. They are presented in euros and all values are rounded to the nearest million  
(EUR 000,000), except when otherwise indicated.
Changes in EU-endorsed published IFRS standards and interpretations effective in 2022
Significant new and amended standards adopted by the Group
TenneT has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective.
IFRS standards issued but not yet effective and adopted by the Group
It is anticipated that any issued changes to IFRS standards that are not yet effective and adopted by TenneT will not have a 
significant impact.

Basis for consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of TenneT Holding B.V. and its subsidiaries as at 
31 December 2022. A list of the legal entities included in the consolidation is included in note 31. Subsidiaries are 
consolidated from the date of acquisition, constituting the date on which control is obtained and continue to be consolidated 
until the date when such control ceases. The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period 
as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies. All intercompany balances, transactions, unrealised gains and 
losses resulting from intercompany transactions and dividends are eliminated in full in consolidation.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. If we 
cease to have control over a subsidiary, we derecognise the subsidiary's assets (including goodwill), liabilities and any 
non-controlling interest in the former subsidiary at the date control is lost (including the cumulative translation differences). 
Furthermore, the fair value of the consideration received, the fair value of any investment retained and any surplus or deficit in 
statement of income are recognised. Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method, where the purchase price 
is allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a fair value basis and the remainder is recognised as 
goodwill.
Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
during the reporting period. Such estimates are assessed continuously on the basis of previous results and experience, 
consultations with experts, trends, prognoses and other methods which we deem appropriate in each individual case. Actual 
results could differ from these estimates. Significant items containing estimates and assumptions are as follows: 
Item Note Estimate/assumptions
Tangible fixed assets 8 Estimate of remaining useful life, identification of cash-
generating units for fixed asset impairment testing
Right-of-use assets and liabilities 9 Estimates of discount rate and expected extension or 
accelerated termination date
Intangible fixed assets 10 Estimate of recoverable amount and remaining useful life
Impairment review of goodwill 10 Estimate of cash flow projections and pre-tax discount rate
Grid expense payable 25 Amongst others estimate of electricity usage and energy prices
Impairment of current assets 15 Estimate of expected credit losses
Provision for environmental management and decommissioning 22 Estimate of removal costs, removal dates, discount rate and 
price increases in the period leading up to removal
Tariff related provisions 22 Estimate of electricity usage and number of parties
Other provisions 22 Mainly relate to estimate of probability, realisation date and 
curtailed feed-in volumes and prices
Net employee benefit obligations 23 Financial, actuarial and demographic assumptions
Functional currency
These consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is also the parent company’s and all subsidiaries` 
functional currency.
Adjustment in prior year’s figures
After publication of the TenneT Integrated Annual Report 2021, we identified a misstatement in the consolidated statement of 
cash flows; the increase(/decrease) in account- and other payables was reported as -/- EUR 319 million and should have 
been EUR 540 million, the purchase of tangible and intangible fixed assets was reported as -/- EUR 2,852 million and should 
have been -/- EUR 3,711 million. We have adjusted the misstatement.

After publication of the TenneT Integrated Annual Report 2021, we identified a misstatement in the consolidated statement of 
financial position that the non-controlling interest regarding one of our consolidated entities (TOD3) should be classified as 
non-current other financial liability instead of total equity. We have adjusted the error retrospectively, for an overview of the 
impacted accounts reference is made to the table below. Reference is also made to sections 19 and 24. The adjustments 
are the following:

2 Segment information
This section sets out the financial performance for the year in accordance with the way in which we manage our business 
(operating segments). We measure and assess our performance based on underlying financial information, which is 
explained further below. 
We generate substantially all of our revenue from our regulated operating segments in the Netherlands and Germany. 
Therefore, close collaboration with our respective regulators to obtain regulations and agreements that provide reasonable 
compensation for the risks we face, is key to us. Our involvement in certain limited non-regulated activities is closely related 
and ancillary to our core tasks.
Segment analysis
Our operating segments consist of:
• TSO Netherlands
• TSO Germany
• Non-regulated activities
For management information purposes, the performance of our regulated activities in the Netherlands and in Germany is 
considered separately into two geographical segments. This segmentation, based on separately applicable regulatory 
frameworks, is the key determinant for financial management of the business and for decision-making on budgets, allocation 
of resources and financing. 
Financing activities (including finance income and expenses) are managed on a Group basis and amounts related thereto are 
not allocated to the segments. Transfer prices between the Netherlands and Germany are set at arm’s length in a manner 
similar to transactions with third parties. These intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Our Executive Board is the chief operating decision-making body of the company (as defined by IFRS 8 ‘Operating 
segments’). Periodically, it monitors the performance of the respective operating segments for the purpose of performance 
management and decision making about resource allocation. The segment performance is based on underlying financial 
information, where EBIT, investments and return on capital are key metrics. The definition of EBIT equals operating result. 
Performance of non-regulated activities is evaluated based on EBIT and return on capital of these activities.

Underlying financial information is based on the principle of recognising regulatory assets and liabilities for all of our regulated 
activities. This implies that amounts resulting from past events and which are allowed to be received or are required to be 
returned through future tariffs are recorded as an asset or liability, respectively. TenneT’s Executive Board believes that the 
presentation of underlying financial information provides additional relevant insight in the actual business, financial 
performance, and as such economic reality.

Matching is achieved through recognition of regulatory deferral accounts. The key requirement for such recognition is that an 
existing regulatory framework must be in place that permits the future reimbursement or requires the future settlement of 
regulated assets or liabilities, respectively. Consequently, a regulated asset is recognised in underlying financial information in 
respect of permitted reimbursements of current year expenses in future year's tariffs. Vice versa, a regulated liability is 
recognised in underlying financial information in respect of required settlements (i.e. repayments) of current year revenues 
through future tariffs. Furthermore, until 2015 certain investments in the Netherlands were financed via auction receipts 
resulting from auctioning available electricity transmission capacity on cross-border interconnections.
We have no individual clients which are invoiced more than 10% of our total group revenue.

Regulatory deferral accounts: reconciliation to IFRS figures
The difference between underlying financial information - as presented in the segment information and board report - and 
IFRS reported figures is related to the recognition of regulated assets and liabilities, auction receipts and the measurement of 
tangible fixed assets. In the IFRS financial statements, revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of 
the goods or services is transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects 
to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In the underlying financial information revenues are recognised 
according the permissible tariff decision adopted by the regulator. By doing so, volume and post calculation differences are 
directly matched to the related costs and therefore provide additional relevant insight to manage TenneT's business.
These differences also result in different deferred tax balances in underlying financial information compared to IFRS reported 
figures. No other differences between underlying financial information and IFRS exist.

The increase in the underlying revenues can mainly be explained by:
• The higher costs for redispatch, grid losses, reserve power plants and control power in 2022 result in higher underlying 
revenues, since those higher costs will be reimbursed through future tariffs;
• Increased revenues due to ongoing and increasing investments, resulting in a growing regulatory asset base and higher 
onshore and offshore revenues which are based upon these asset base values;
• Increased regulatory returns due to an increase in interest rates.

Our IFRS result takes account of our high costs during 2022, mainly due to the grid expenses, but does not account for 
future reimbursements we will receive through correspondingly higher future tariffs. This causes for that reason the significant 
lower EBIT based on IFRS (loss amounting to EUR 976 million) compared to the underlying financial information (profit 
amounting to EUR 1,210 million).
The material differences between underlying financial information and IFRS are hereafter further disclosed:
To be settled in tariffs
Revenue surpluses and deficits resulting from variances related to actual costs or transmission volumes (ex post) and 
estimates used to set tariffs (ex ante) are incorporated in the tariffs of subsequent years in both Germany and the 
Netherlands. In underlying financial information, these surpluses and deficits are recorded as assets and liabilities, 
respectively, under ‘to be settled in tariffs’. The expenses related to these items have to be settled in future tariffs in the 
coming years.
The underlying item ‘to be settled in tariffs’ is related to the revenue stream ‘connection and transmission services’ and 
concerns an increase amounting to EUR 2,603 million (2021: decrease of EUR 1,317 million).
Auction receipts & investment contributions
Auction receipts result from auctioning the available electricity transmission capacity on cross-border interconnections. These 
receipts are not at TenneT's free disposal. In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2019/943, auction receipts shall be used to 
fulfill the following priority objectives:
a. guaranteeing the actual availability of the allocated capacity including firmness compensation; or
b. maintaining or increasing cross-zonal capacities through optimisation of the usage of existing interconnectors by means 
of coordinated remedial actions, where applicable, or covering costs resulting from network investments that are relevant 
to reduce interconnector congestion.
In Germany, auction proceeds are recognised as interest-free capital on investments and are released over 20 years.  
The reversal amounts are applied in the revenue cap of the TenneT TSO GmbH with t-2 offset. Thus, the reversal amount 
offsets the depreciation of the investments. The difference between IFRS and underlying revenue in Germany in 2022 is  
EUR 907 million.
When these priority objectives have been adequately fulfilled, auction receipts may be used as income to be taken into 
account by the regulatory authorities when approving the methodology for calculating network tariffs or fixing network tariffs, 
or both. In the Netherlands, TenneT agreed with its regulator (Autoriteit Consument en Markt) that investments in 
interconnectors are no longer financed through the auction receipts as of 2016. The current outstanding balance of auction 
receipts will be used in accordance with the aforementioned objectives. On 22 November 2022, the competence agreement 
of 2015 between TenneT and the ACM was dissolved. Investments in previous years financed by using auction receipts are 
classified as investment contributions and are reported under ‘liabilities’. A periodic amount equal to the depreciation 
charges, plus a portion of the operating expenses, is released to the statement of income, following the release scheme  
as described above.
The underlying item auction receipts is part of revenue stream ‘operations of energy exchanges’ for a decrease amounting to 
EUR 900 million (2021: decrease EUR 387 million). The underlying item investment contribution is part of revenue stream 
‘other’ for an amount of EUR 11 million increase (2021: EUR 1 million increase).
Maintenance of the energy balance
As system manager of the high-voltage grid in the Netherlands, TenneT receives funds for performing certain statutory 
duties, such as the maintenance of the energy balance. The proceeds from these activities (i.e., imbalance settlements) may 
only be used after approval by the ACM. Imbalance settlements collected during the year are to be offset in transmission 
tariffs in the subsequent year. Consequently, these amounts are recorded as a liability and released in the subsequent year in 
the underlying financial information.

As the balancing group coordinator, TenneT TSO GmbH (‘TTG’) is responsible for balancing the balancing groups in terms of 
energy. We balance surplus or shortfall balancing groups by means of control energy and bill the balancing group managers 
for the resulting costs. For this billing of balance imbalances, the so-called ‘Uniform balancing energy price across control 
zones’ (reBAP) is used. As a result, TTG receives higher payments from the balancing group managers than TTG pays to the 
power plant operators. The resulting additional revenues from the balancing energy billing system are to be deducted from 
the grid charges. Analogously, revenue shortages will increase future grid fees.
The underlying item maintenance of the energy balance is part of revenue ‘stream maintenance’ of the energy balance for an 
amount of EUR 173 million decrease (2021: EUR 85 million decrease).
Depreciation and amortisation of assets
Differences in depreciation and amortisation of assets occur due to the difference in accounting treatment of the regulatory 
deferral accounts and the related cash flows in order to determine the economic useful life and recoverable amount of the 
assets resulting from acquisitions and used for impairment analysis.

Connection and transmission services
Revenue from connection and transmission services is regulated by the ACM in the Netherlands and by the BNetzA in 
Germany and includes revenue from services provided to DSOs and industrial clients (such as resolution of transmission 
restrictions, congestion management and reactive power management). 
Revenue increased mainly due to ongoing investments and a growing asset base. Furthermore, in Germany the 2022 tariffs 
include already the increased energy prices of 2021 that we have to pay for ancillary services.

Maintenance of the energy balance
TenneT is responsible to ensure that electricity supply and demand is in balance at all times (i.e. the alternating current 
frequency in the power grid must be at 50 Hz continuously). If this balance is significantly disrupted, it may result in a power 
outage or even a black-out, depending on the length and severity of the imbalance. To ensure this balance, TenneT contracts 
and deploys (among others) reserve and emergency capacity to compensate unexpected fluctuations in supply and 
demand. The cash in- and outflows associated with maintaining this energy balance (e.g. imbalance settlements) fluctuate 
considerably and are settled through regulated tariffs in both the Netherlands and Germany in subsequent years.
Revenue increased mainly due to higher energy prices, which resulted in a higher price for the imbalance settlement. 
Operation of energy exchanges
This amount includes revenues resulting from the auctioning of cross-border (electricity transmission ‘interconnection’) 
capacity.
Revenue increased mainly due to higher energy prices.
Offshore (balancing)
Increase in revenues is explained by the increase in the asset base, its related costs and an increase in the energy prices. 
Revenue from offshore (balancing) is regulated. 
i Accounting policy 
Revenue primarily represents the sales value derived from the connection and transmission of electricity together with the 
sales value derived from the provision of other services to customers during the year. Revenue from contracts with 
customers is recognised when control of the goods or services is transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the 
consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. 
Revenues arise from contracts with a single performance obligation. The assessment of unbilled connection and 
transmission services supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and year-end is subject to significant 
judgement. This assessment is primarily based on expected consumption and weather patterns.
If revenue received or receivable exceeds the maximum annual amount as determined by the national regulators, ACM or 
BNetzA respectively, a downward adjustment will be made to future tariffs to reflect this over-recovery. Under IFRS, no liability 
is recognised since this adjustment relates to the provision of future services. Similarly, no asset is recognised under IFRS 
when a regulator permits increases to be made to future tariffs in respect of under-recovery.
Offshore (balancing) revenues in the Netherlands are accounted for in accordance with the recognition and measurement 
principles of IAS 20. These revenues are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the Group satisfies the 
conditions attached to receiving this income.

Due to the current market situation caused by the war in Ukraine energy expenses increased rapidly and are very volatile. 
This leads to increasing system services due to higher costs related to feed-in management, transmission restrictions, grid 
losses and redispatch costs. The increase is caused both by higher energy prices due to market situation and more 
transmission restrictions. Increase of cost of maintaining and operating transmissions grids mainly related to higher insurance 
costs. The higher grid expenses and project costs will be reimbursed through future tariffs, which will result in considerable 
higher grid tariffs in future years. Please refer to Note 2 for further details about differences between IFRS and Underlying 
financial information.

The financial audit fees include the aggregate fees in 2022 and 2021 for professional services rendered for the audit of 
TenneT’s Integrated Annual Report and annual statutory financial statements of subsidiaries or services that are normally 
provided by the auditor in connection with these audits.
The other assurance fees include the aggregate fees invoiced for assurance and services for other audit services, which 
generally only the company’s independent auditor can reasonably provide, such as comfort letters, regulatory statements 
and audits of grant statements.
i Accounting policy 
TenneT has energy purchase contracts for the forward purchase of energy or gas that are used to satisfy physical delivery 
requirements to customers or for the energy that the group uses itself. Substantially all our costs of purchasing electricity for 
supply to customers are recoverable at an amount equal to cost. The timing of recovery of these costs can vary between 
financial periods leading to an under- or over-recovery within any particular year that can lead to large fluctuations in the IFRS 
income statement. We follow approved policies to manage price and supply risks for our commodity activities.
TenneT's energy procurement risk management policy and delegations of authority govern its commodity trading activities 
for energy transactions. The purpose of this policy is to ensure we transact within pre-defined risk parameters and only in the 
physical and financial markets where we or our customers have a physical market requirement. In addition, state regulators 
require TenneT to manage commodity risk and cost volatility prudently through diversified pricing strategies. In both the 
Netherlands and Germany, we are required to file a plan outlining our energy procurement strategy to be approved by the 
respective regulator. In certain cases, we might receive guidance with regard to specific hedging limits.
Energy purchase contracts for the forward purchase of electricity that are used to satisfy physical delivery requirements to 
customers, or for energy that TenneT uses itself, meet the expected purchase or usage requirements of IFRS 9. They are, 
therefore, not recognised in the financial statements until they are realised. In note 28 of the consolidated financial 
statements commitments under such contracts have been disclosed as ‘Grid related commitments’.
Operating expenses are expenses incurred during regular day-to-day business, such as system services, connection and 
transmission services, personnel expenses, depreciation and accommodation and travel costs. Operating expenses are 
recorded in the statement of income in the period they are incurred.

5 Finance income and expenses
Finance income
This mainly relates to an amount of EUR 38 million that was recognised regarding a settled court case.
Finance expenses 
 
(EUR million) 2022  2021
Interest on borrowings and credit facilities 245 175
Capitalised interest on assets under construction -12 -13

Interest on defined benefit pension plans 5 3
Interest on lease liability 4 2
Interest on other financial liability 22 20
Other finance expenses 11 14
Total 300 202
Finance expenses mainly increased due to new issued bonds in 2022. These bonds had higher interest rates as bonds 
issued before 2022. Furthermore the increase is related to bonds issued in 2021 that are now recognised for the full year. 
Interest on provisions increased due to the increased provisions and increased discount rates.
i Accounting policy 
Finance expenses comprise mainly interest expenses, such as interest and fees on borrowings and credit facilities, interest 
on provisions, interest on defined benefit plans and interest on lease liabilities. Finance expenses are recorded in the 
statement of income using the effective interest rate method.
6 Corporate income tax
TenneT strives to comply with all applicable tax legislation in a socially responsible manner, maintaining among the highest 
levels of transparency, quality and integrity. Management responsibility and oversight of our tax strategy lies with our ‘Chief 
Financial Officer’ (CFO), our Director Financial Governance & Services and our Head of Tax who monitor our tax activities and 
report to the Executive Board and the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee.
Our tax strategy is fully consistent with our corporate strategy. Building a transparent relationship with tax authorities based 
on mutual trust is an integral part of this strategy. We have built and are continuously improving our tax internal control 
framework system to be ‘in control’ and mitigate tax risks and to allow the company to demonstrate to all its stakeholders, 
including the tax authorities, that the company complies with all applicable laws and regulations.
Corporate income tax is payable in the Netherlands and Germany. In the Netherlands, we have entered into a so called 
‘horizontal monitoring agreement’ with the Dutch tax authorities. TenneT is currently working with the Dutch tax authorities to 
further extend this agreement. Based on transparency and mutual trust, this agreement is meant to ensure that tax positions 
are fully disclosed and agreed on in advance, as a result of which generally no tax audits are performed by the Dutch tax 
authorities. All corporate income tax returns in the Netherlands have been filed up to and including 2020. Corporate income 
tax paid in the Netherlands in 2022 amounted to EUR 59 million.
In Germany, corporate income and trade tax returns for all German entities have been filed up to and including fiscal  
year 2021. In 2022, we paid EUR 172 million of corporate income tax in Germany.

Key components of corporate income tax expense are: 
 
Consolidated income statement (EUR million) 2022  2021
Current income tax charge 254 152
Deferred tax: -608 -287
Income tax expense reported in the statement of income -354 -135
 
Consolidated statement of comprehensive income (EUR million) 2022  2021
Effect of re-measurement of defined benefit pensions -64 -23
Income tax charged directly to other comprehensive income -64 -23
Corporate income tax on results has been applied at the rates prevailing in the respective countries. In the Netherlands, a 
statutory corporate income tax rate of 25.8% was applied, while in Germany, on average, a marginal statutory corporate 
income tax rate of 29.84% was applied (including trade tax levied by municipalities or ‘Gewerbesteuer'). Reconciliation 
between corporate income tax expense and the accounting result multiplied by a statutory corporate income tax rate of 
25.8% is as follows: 
(EUR million) 2022  2021
Result before corporate income tax -1,233 -455
Statutory corporate income tax rate in the Netherlands of 25.8% (2021: 25%) -318 -113
Effect of higher corporate income tax rate in Germany -17 -8
Effect of future tax rate change in the Netherlands - -4
Adjustment in respect to current and deferred tax of previous years 1 -
Non-deductible costs 11 2
Non-taxable income -29 -9
Tax paid by third parties -2 -3
At the effective corporate income tax rate of 29% (2021: 30%) -354 -135
The main reason for the higher effective tax rate of 29% compared to the Dutch statutory tax rate of 25.8% is the effect of the 
higher tax rate in Germany. Since the accounting result before tax is in a loss position, the items non-taxable income and tax 
paid by third parties, increase the effective tax rate, which in a positive result position normally decreases the effective tax rate.

i Accounting policy
The corporate income tax charge for the period is recognised in the statement of income, equity or the statement of 
comprehensive income, in accordance with the relevant accounting treatment of the related transaction. The corporate 
income tax charge comprises both current and deferred tax.
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from, or paid to, the tax 
authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to calculate these amounts are those enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date in those countries where we operate and where we generate taxable income.

Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method with respect to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their respective carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is 
settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the 
relevant jurisdictions.
Deferred tax is generally recognised in respect of all temporary differences, the carry-forward of unused tax credits and any 
unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets (also in association with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint 
arrangements) are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable result will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences and the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised. This assessment is 
performed annually. Deferred tax is not recognised for the temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of goodwill 
or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither 
the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become 
probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. There are no unrecognised carry-forward 
losses per 31 December 2022 (2021: nil).
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised on a gross basis in the statement of financial position unless:
• the entity has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and
• the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on 
either:
• the same taxable entity, or
• different taxable entities which intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the 
assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax 
liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.
7 Earnings per share
Earnings per share were calculated by dividing results for the year attributable to ordinary shareholder of the Group, after 
adjustment for the distribution on hybrid securities, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during 
the year. The following table reflects the income and share data used for the basic and diluted earnings per share 
calculations. 
(EUR million) 2022  2021
Result for the year attributable to the ordinary shareholder of the company -910 -344
Allocation to hybrid securities -57 -57
Result for the year attributable to equity holders of the company adjusted for the allocation to hybrid 
securities -967 -401
Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue (in thousands) 200 200
i Accounting policy
Calculation of earnings per share is based on the result for the year attributable to TenneT's sole shareholder and the 
weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year.

High-voltage substations include onshore and offshore transformer and converter stations. High-voltage connections consist 
of overhead and underground connections. Unlike lands for substations, lands surrounding high-voltage pylons and cables 
are generally not owned by TenneT. Other tangible fixed assets consist of office buildings, office ICT equipment and other 
company assets.
In 2022 the discount rate used for the decommissioning provision was between 2.086% and 2.942% (2021: 0.165% and 
0.318%) for offshore wind farms (OWF) connections (see note 22). The discount rate was adjusted in 2022 to reflect current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to this liability. The main part of the decommissioning 
provision was recognised as part of the carrying value of the related asset. Besides the change of the discount rate, also 
changes in inflation, changes in underlying assumptions and updated price levels are included in the change of estimates. 
The amount of borrowing costs capitalised during 2022 is disclosed in note 5. The effective interest rate used to determine 
the amount of borrowing costs capitalised was 1.34% (2021: 2.0%).

Annual impairment trigger analyses on tangible assets, and where applicable testing for impairment, is done at the individual 
asset level, or smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash 
inflows from other assets or groups of assets (cash generating units (CGUs)). For our three operating segments this consists 
of:
• TSO Netherlands (One large CGU consisting of regulated on- and offshore assets, and the NorNed cable, considered for 
impairment (triggers), on individual level);
• TSO Germany (One large CGU consisting of regulated on- and offshore assets);
• Non-regulated companies (Several small CGUs as well as individual assets).
The non-regulated companies also include the Joint Venture investment in the BritNed cable, tested, for impairment 
(triggers), on individual level. 
i Accounting policy
Tangible fixed assets are valued at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Such 
costs include the cost of replacing part of the asset and borrowing costs for long-term construction projects if the 
recognition criteria are met. When significant parts of the asset are required to be replaced at intervals, such parts are 
recognised as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciated accordingly. Likewise, when major maintenance is 
performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the asset as a replacement, if the recognition criteria are met. All 
other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in the statement of income as incurred. The present value of the 
expected cost for the decommissioning of an asset after its use is included in the cost of the respective asset, if the 
recognition criteria for a provision are met. Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis.
An asset is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss 
arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset) is included in the statement of income when the asset is derecognised.
General and specific borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of the tangible fixed 
assets, are added to the cost, until such time that the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. No 
borrowing costs are capitalised if and to the extent such borrowing costs are directly compensated in the year of 
construction.

Leased Land & Buildings
Land is mainly leased to set up pylons for electricity transmission lines and for constructed substations. These contracts run 
for a period of 18-142 years. Buildings are leased mainly as office space and for storage space. These contracts run for a 
period of 1-23 years.
Lease contracts for buildings are negotiated individually and include a range of different terms and conditions, including 
extension options.
Lease payments are in substance fixed, only a minority of the lease contracts contain clauses with reference to the CPI index.
Leased power plants
TenneT is committed to the use of grid reserve power plants representing lease commitments according to IFRS 16. The 
commitments have a maturity of 1-3 years and can be prolonged depending on the decision of regulatory authorities.
Lease payments were in substance fixed and TenneT had no power plant leases which contained variable lease payments. 
Lease contracts did not include any clauses with reference to an index or contractual rate.
Leased NordLink cable
TenneT leases the NordLink submarine cable from NOKA to transport electricity between Germany and Norway. The lease 
contract is extended which resulted in a remeasurement and has a remaining maturity of 6 years, and no extension option 
according to IFRS 16 is included in the lease contract. Lease payments are in substance fixed.

Leased others
Telecom lease contracts (including fibreglass cables) run for a period between 1 and 30 years. For qualifying employees 
TenneT leased cars with a lease term between 1 and 7 years. TenneT does not purchase or guarantee the value of leased 
telecom assets or cars.
TenneT had several contracts with termination / extension options. In determining the lease term all relevant facts and 
circumstances that create a significant economic incentive to exercise those options are taken into consideration.
TenneT had no material 'sub lease' contracts in 2022 and 2021 and therefore no material income from subleasing  
right-of-use assets. TenneT has not entered into any sale and leaseback contracts. No lease contracts with residual value 
guarantees are entered into. No lease contracts have been concluded that contain restrictions or covenants.
Lease payments were in substance fixed, only some of the lease contracts had pre-determined lease payment changes.
Short-term leases and leases of low value
TenneT leased certain other assets with terms up to 1 year. TenneT considers these assets to be of low-value or short-term 
in nature and therefore no right of use assets and lease liabilities were recognised for these leases. The aggregate total of 
short-term lease expenses for more than one month and low value assets lease expenses amounted to EUR 2 million  
(2021: EUR 2 million).

i Accounting policy
At inception of a contract, TenneT assesses whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for 
a period in exchange for consideration, in which case it is classified as a lease.
TenneT recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The asset is initially measured 
at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the 
commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to restore the underlying asset, less any 
lease incentives received.
The lease asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of 
the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term, considered to be indicated by the lease term. 
The lease asset is periodically adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability and impairment losses (if any).
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of outstanding lease payments, discounted using the interest rate 
implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, TenneT's incremental borrowing rate. If available, the interest 
rate implicit in the lease is used for discounting (e.g. car leases). Otherwise the incremental borrowing rate is used and 
shown in the table below.

After initial recognition, the lease liability is measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments using the effective 
interest method and is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate 
or if TenneT changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option. A corresponding 
adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset with any excess over the carrying amount of the asset 
being recognised as profit or loss.
Short-term leases and leases of low value
TenneT has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases (leases with a term of  
12 months or less) and leases of low-value assets. TenneT recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as 
an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term or another systematic basis, if that basis is more representative of the 
pattern of the lessee’s benefit. Furthermore, TenneT has elected not to recognise the lease of intangible assets.

i Accounting policy
Intangible assets are measured at acquisition cost on initial recognition. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business 
combination is recognised at fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at 
cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Except for capitalised development costs, 
internally generated intangible assets are not capitalised and expenses are reflected in the statement of income in the period 
in which they incur.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost and represents the excess (i) of the consideration transferred over (ii) TenneT’s interest  
in the value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree and the amount of the non-
controlling interest in the acquiree. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
At each reporting date, we assess whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists,  
or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. The recoverable 
amount is the higher of an asset’s or CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. If the carrying amount of  
an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable 
amount.

Estimated useful lives intangible assets Years
Goodwill Indefinite
Software 3-12
Customer contracts 10-14
Purchased rights to use land 25-45
Other 5-15
Intangible assets, with the exception of goodwill, are assumed to have a fixed useful life within the ranges outlined above and 
are amortised over this useful life. The useful life is re-assessed each reporting period. Intangible assets are amortised on a 
straight line basis, as this best reflects the use of the asset.
Goodwill is assumed to have an indefinite useful life and is therefore not amortised, but is tested for impairment annually or 
more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate a triggering event, either individually or at CGU level. 
Impairment testing of goodwill
For the purpose of annual impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the CGUs. 
For our three operating segments this consists of:
• TSO Netherlands (One large Cash Generating Unit consisting of regulated on- and offshore assets)
• TSO Germany (One large Cash Generating Unit consisting of regulated on- and offshore assets)
• Non-regulated companies (Several small Cash Generating Units)
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate 
that reflects our assessment of current market conditions in respect of the time value of money and the risks specific to the 
asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, an appropriate valuation model is used, if no recent market 
transactions can be identified.
The impairment calculation is based on detailed projections, which are prepared separately for each of the CGUs to which 
the individual assets are allocated. The projections take into account current regulatory parameters, considering expected 
future regulatory developments. Management believes that the resulting cash flows can be determined reliably and that they 
give an appropriate reflection of the CGU's cash flow generating potential.

The recoverable amount of the German CGU was determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow 
projections from our three year business plan. The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections was 6.7%  
(2021: 3.9%). The cash flows beyond the three-year period until 2044 were estimated on the basis of projected regulatory 
allowed returns and invested capital. The terminal value was determined estimating the regulatory asset base as of 
December 2044. We concluded that the recoverable amount as at 31 December 2022 was significantly in excess of the 
carrying value and as such no impairment loss needed to be recognised.
11 Business combinations
Mergers and acquisitions
As of 31 December 2022 CertiQ B.V. merged with Vertogas B.V. into VertiCer B.V. Vertogas B.V. is the issued body for green 
gas certificates and was fully owned by Gasunie N.V. After this merger, both Gasunie and TenneT hold 50% of the shares in 
VertiCer B.V.
Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale
Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale entirely relate to Novec GmbH. The Group currently holds a 100% interest in 
Novec GmbH. TenneT and management are exploring strategic partnerships which is committed to result in a sale of Novec 
GmbH.
Novec GmbH is included in the ‘non-regulated companies’ segment (note 2) and is not considered as a major business line 
of the Group.
The fair value less costs to sell exceeds the carrying amount of Novec GmbH and the Group expects to realise the sale of 
Novec GmbH in the course of 2023.
i Accounting policy
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the 
aggregate of assets and liabilities measured at their acquisition-date fair value (with a limited number of specified exceptions) 
including the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. For each business combination, we decide whether to 
measure the non-controlling interest in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net 
assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred in connection with an acquisition and included in other operating 
expenses (see note 4).
Non-current assets held for sale are defined as non-current assets (other than financial instruments or property investments) 
immediately available for sale and highly likely to be sold within a year. Non-current assets held for sale have been stated at 
the lower of (i) the asset’s carrying value and, (ii) fair value less costs of disposal.
12 Investments in joint ventures and associates
Joint ventures
TenneT has, directly or indirectly, 50% equity stakes in BritNed Development Ltd. ('BritNed'), DC Nordseekabel GmbH & Co. 
KG (‘NOKA’), DC Nordseekabel Beteiligungs GmbH, Reddyn B.V. and Tensz B.V. We have a 20% equity stake in Equigy B.V. 
and a 25% indirect equity stake in Open Tower Company (OTC). For the investments in Equigy B.V. and OTC, joint control is 
exercised, despite unequal equity stakes. Therefore both investments are classified as joint ventures as of 2021. In 
December 2021 Flexcess GmbH was established as joint venture together with TransnetBW. Both shareholders have a 50% 
equity stake. Flexcess GmbH has a 20% participation in Equigy B.V. effective as of 1 January 2022. As of 31 December 
2022 TenneT has a 50% participation in VertiCer B.V.
These investments are classified as joint ventures, for which only the investments in BritNed (legal seat: Arnhem, the 
Netherlands), OTC (legal seat: Vianen, the Netherlands) and NOKA (legal seat: Bayreuth, Germany) are each considered as 
an investment of material value. Other joint ventures are considered immaterial and are therefore not further disclosed. 
TenneT's share in result (which is equal to other and total comprehensive income) of these immaterial joint ventures 
amounted to EUR 1 million in 2022 (2021: EUR 1 million).

HGRT
The legal seat of HGRT is in Paris, France. HGRT holds a 49% stake in EPEX. EPEX is the exchange for the power spot 
markets for the 'North West Europe' (NWE) region and the United Kingdom. At 31 December 2022, HGRT had no 
contingent liabilities outstanding (2021: nil). In 2022 EUR 4 million dividend was received (2021: EUR 3 million).
Other
Our interest in other associates amounted EUR 5 million at 31 December 2022 (2021: EUR 3 million). From other associates 
we received nil dividend in 2022 (2021: nil).
i Accounting policy 
A joint venture is an arrangement whereby the parties in the arrangement have joint control over the net assets of the joint 
arrangement.
Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the 
relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. An associate is an entity in which we have 
significant influence, but no control. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy 
decisions of the investor.
Investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the 
investment in the joint venture or associate is initially recognised at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted 
to recognise changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the investment since the acquisition date. Goodwill relating to the 
associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortised nor individually tested for impairment.
The statement of income reflects our share in the results of operations of investments. Any change in other comprehensive 
income of these investments is presented as part of the other comprehensive income. In addition, when there is a change 
recognised directly in the equity of the investment, our share of any change is recognised in the statement of changes in 
equity. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between us and any investment are eliminated to the extent of 
the interest in such investment. When an associate or joint venture distributes dividend to us in excess of our carrying 
amount, a liability is recognised if TenneT:
• is obliged to refund the dividend;
• has incurred a legal or constructive obligation; or 
• made payments on behalf of the associate.
In the absence of such obligations, the excess in net result for the period is recognised. When the associate or joint venture 
subsequently generates results, this is only recognised if and to the extent they exceed the excess cash distributions 
recognised in net results plus any previously unrecognised losses.
After application of the equity method, we determine whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss on our 
investment in the joint venture or associate. At each reporting date, we determine whether there is objective evidence that 
the investment is impaired. If such evidence exists, the amount of impairment is calculated as the excess of the carrying 
value of the investment over its recoverable amount and recognised in the statement of income.
Upon loss of significant influence over the joint venture/associate, any retained investment is valued at fair value. Any 
difference between the carrying amount of the investment upon loss of significant influence and the fair value of the retained 
investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in the statement of income.

i Accounting policies
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct purchase costs and associated costs 
incurred in bringing inventories to their present condition and location. The net realisable value is the estimated selling price in 
the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make a sale.

EEG trade receivables and amounts to be invoiced to EEG trade debtors
In accordance with the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) TenneT TSO GmbH is required to purchase electricity from 
producers of renewable energy at fixed feed-in tariffs. Subsequently such renewable energy is sold on power exchanges at 
spot prices.
EEG revenues and expenses are legally required to be administrated separately and are legally designated to be equal, 
except for certain potential bonus amounts payable to TenneT for marketing the energy on power exchanges. The EEG levy 
also includes an additional liquidity buffer to avoid a net financing need for the TSOs. TenneT acts as an agent with respect 
to these EEG services.
EEG trade debtors and receivables consisted of the accrual of unbilled EEG levy mainly for the month December, the 
outstanding invoices for the EEG levy, the accrual for horizontal balancing amounts (i.e. unsettled charges to the other 
German TSOs) and energy trading revenues. EEG trade receivables were not at our free disposal. Please refer to note 25  
for the EEG accounts payable.
Please refer to note 16 for EEG deposits.
Trade receivables

As at 31 December 2022, receivables with an initial value of EUR 5 million (2021: EUR 21 million) were fully provided for.
Amounts to be invoiced
The majority of the amounts to be invoiced related to unbilled grid fees and rechargeable offshore costs in Germany.  
The increase is mainly related to increased redispatch costs that will be charged to clients.

Funds related to EEG activities have been legally separated as required by BNetzA. EEG Funds are not at the TenneT's free 
disposal. For further reference regarding EEG we refer to note 15. Cash at banks carry interest at floating rates based on 
daily bank deposit rates which may at times be negative. 
The Group presents its cash flows in the consolidated statement of cash flows using the indirect method. The Group has 
elected to classify interest received as cash flows from investing activities and interest paid (including interest on lease 
liabilities) as cash flows from financing activities.
i Accounting policy
In the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank, deposits held at call with 
banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of three months or less and are presented net of 
outstanding bank overdrafts. Securities are deposits on collaterals that serve as financial security for auction and energy 
exchange transactions. A matching obligation is recognised towards the party that deposited the funds as collateral. 
Securities are stated at fair value upon receipt and subsequently at amortised cost.
17 Capital management
The primary objective of TenneT's capital structure is to ensure a sustainable financial position to absorb adverse changes in 
the regulatory environment and to enable us to execute our extensive investment programme which is essential for the 
success of the energy transition in the Netherlands and Germany. The majority of the funding for our investment programme 
is sourced from the debt capital markets, commercial banks and international financial institutions (e.g. the European 
Investment Bank). 
To maintain broad access to financial markets at favourable conditions, we have defined capital management objectives, 
policies and processes which include:
1. to maintain a senior unsecured long-term credit rating of at least A3/A-;
2. to maintain a long-term average Funds From Operations (FFO) to Net debt based on ‘underlying’ financial information of 
at least 8.5% (with individual years of at least 8.0%);
3. to diversify the maturities of long-term funding instruments to limit refinancing risk;
4. to maintain liquidity through cash and undrawn committed credit lines covering at least our net cash requirement on a 
rolling 12-month forward-looking basis.
1. Maintain a senior unsecured credit rating of at least A3/A-
As of 31 December 2022 TenneT Holding B.V. had the following senior unsecured long-term credit ratings from  
Standard & Poor’s and Moody's Investor Service, which comply with our financial policy.

2. Maintain a long-term average FFO/Net debt ratio based on underlying financial information of at least 8.5%
To maintain a solid financial position, we intend to maintain a long-term average FFO/Net debt ratio of at least 8.5% based 
on underlying financial information (see note 2), which meets the minimum requirements for an A-/A3 long-term unsecured 
credit rating as formulated by the credit rating agencies Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor Service. Individual years 
have a FFO/Net debt of at least 8.0%.
A reconciliation of the Adjusted FFO and net debt is provided in the following table. Please refer to the chapter ‘Secure a 
sustainable financial performance and investor rating’ for detailed information about the Adjusted FFO.

3. Diversify maturities of long-term funding instruments to limit refinancing risk
To minimise refinancing risk, we diversify the maturity profile of our senior debt. As of 31 December 2022, our interest 
bearing debt (excluding bank overdrafts) had the following annual redemption profile: 
Year Maturities Year Maturities Year Maturities Year Maturities Year Maturities
 2023 709  2028 1,282  2033 1,298  2038 40  2043 14

4. Maintaining liquidity through cash and undrawn committed credit lines covering at least our net cash 
requirement on a rolling 12-month forward-looking basis
We monitor the liquidity of the Group on a rolling 12-month forward-looking basis. This means that the sum of (i) cash and 
cash equivalents, (ii) undrawn committed credit facilities and (iii) 12-month expected net cash flow from operating activities 
should be sufficient to meet the expected aggregate of scheduled debt repayments, investments in fixed assets and 
dividend payments over the subsequent 12 months. The 12-month liquidity requirement was met on 31 December 2022 and 
31 December 2021. 
18 Equity
Paid-up and called-up capital
The Company’s authorised share capital amounted to EUR 500 million (2021: EUR 500 million), divided into one million 
shares of EUR 500 each. Of these shares, two hundred thousand shares have been issued and paid-up.
Share premium reserve
The share premium reserve consists of the capital contributions, made by the shareholder of ordinary shares, the Dutch 
State represented by the Ministry of Finance. In the Dutch State budget ‘miljoenennota’ of September 2022, the Dutch State 
has reserved an amount up to EUR 5.11 billion for additional equity contributions for the period 2022-2025. A first tranche of 
EUR 1,230 million was received in 2022 and the capital contribution has been recognised in the share premium reserve.
Retained earnings
Part of the retained earnings has been presented as legal reserve. For more details see note 41.
Hybrid securities
Hybrid securities are deeply subordinated securities and are, with the exception of common equity, the most junior 
instruments in the capital structure of the Company. The hybrid securities are undated and do not default on non-payment of 
coupons (unless such payment was mandatory following a resolution or payment of a dividend to common shareholders, i.e. 
as so called ‘dividend pusher’). 
The holders of the hybrid securities have limited ability to influence the outcome of a bankruptcy proceeding or a 
restructuring outside bankruptcy. Consequently, the hybrid security holders cannot oblige TenneT to pay distributions or 
redeem the securities in part or in full. Payment of distributions on and redemption of the securities is at our sole discretion. 
As a result, the hybrid securities are classified as part of the equity attributable to the company's owners.

On 31 December 2022, TenneT had EUR 2.1 billion of green hybrid securities outstanding divided in two tranches. The first 
tranche consisted of EUR 1.1 billion green hybrid securities that bear an optional, cumulative coupon of 2.995%, payable at 
TenneT's discretion annually on 1 June of each year. As at 31 December 2022, the unpaid cumulative dividend for this 
tranche amounted to EUR 18 million (2021: EUR 18 million), relating to the period 1 June until 31 December and payable  
on 1 June 2023. The second tranche consisted of EUR 1 billion green hybrid securities that bear an optional, cumulative 
coupon of 2.374%, payable at TenneT’s discretion annually on 22 October of each year. As at 31 December 2022, the 
unpaid cumulative dividend for this tranche amounted to EUR 7 million (2021: EUR 7 million).
Dividend distribution
In 2022 a common full-year dividend of EUR 141 million (EUR 705 per share) to our ordinary shareholder was distributed 
(2021: EUR 149 million). In agreement with the State of the Netherlands TenneT has established a dividend policy with a 
pay-out of 35% of the underlying profit for the year, after payments of distributions to hybrid securities holders and minority 
equity investors. We made aggregate distributions to the holders of hybrid securities of EUR 57 million during 2022  
(2021: EUR 57 million). The appropriation of the 2022 result is at the free disposal of the General Meeting of Shareholders.

i Accounting policy
Contract liabilities are recognised when payments are made, or the payments are due (whichever is earlier) before a related 
performance obligation is satisfied. Contract liabilities are recognised in accordance with the related contract. At initial 
recognition, contributions received from third parties are measured at transaction price, presented as contract liabilities 
(‘investment contributions’) and are subsequently recognised as revenue over the related asset’s useful life.

Provisions for environmental management and decommissioning
Provisions for environmental management and decommissioning serve to cover future obligations in relation to high-voltage 
connections, underground cables and offshore platforms, including decommissioning costs. Asset retirement obligations are 
included for the legal and constructive obligations in relation to all our interconnectors and offshore assets. In 2022  
EUR 140 million was added (2021: EUR 162 million) for future decommissioning costs for projects constructed during 2022. 
Changes in estimates related to the provision for decommissioning amounted to a release of EUR 338 million (2021: increase 
of EUR 78 million), mainly due to changes in the discount rate used and inflation rate, further due to changes in underlying 
assumptions and applicable price levels. Both amounts were not recognised through the statement of income. There was no 
material decommissioning of substations in 2022. In line with current regulation and permits, the first decommissioning of an 
offshore grid connection is expected to start in 2029. 
Tariff related provisions
Tariff-related provisions relate to uncertain regulatory compensations of nil (2021: nil) and to provisions for system service 
fees in the Netherlands. We charge electricity consumers a fee for system services performed. Following a change in law, the 
court in the Netherlands concluded that only parties with a direct connection to a grid maintained by a TSO are required to 
pay system service fees for the period prior to 31 December 2014. Consequently, we are required to refund amounts paid by 
certain parties to us without a direct grid connection. These refunds can be recouped by us through future tariffs. In 2022, nil 
(2021: nil) of the provided amount matured and was released through the statement of income.
Other provisions
The majority of other provisions relates to the risk of compensation payments associated with delays and interruptions of 
offshore grid connections in Germany and claims.
The connection of offshore wind farms presents additional technical and organisational challenges. A number of factors, 
including a lack of supplier resources required for the construction of offshore grid connection systems, as well as weather 
conditions and the application of new technologies, hindered the timely realisation and/or interrupted the operational phase 
of offshore grid connection systems. 
The majority of the claims are related to construction contracts and planning damage where the estimated additional 
payments are capitalised.

On 2 September 2022 a short circuit occurred on the newly built substation Dronten and led to a chain of events that 
caused damage to various parties. For the estimated costs we have recognised a current provision which is recognised 
through the statement of income.
Furthermore this provision is related to long-term service bonuses.
i Accounting policy 
Provisions are recognised when there is (i) a legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, (ii) it is probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and (iii) when the amount can be 
reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at the present value of estimated cash flows to settle obligations, based on 
expected price levels. Cash flows are discounted at a pre-tax rate that reflects the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding 
of interest components associated with provisions is recognised in the statement of income as a finance cost.
Estimated future costs are reviewed annually and adjusted as appropriate. Changes in estimated future costs and discount 
rates for decommissioning costs are recognised as changes in estimations and recorded in tangible fixed assets. All other 
provisions changes in estimated future costs and discount rates are recognised in the statement of income.
+ Key estimates and assumptions 
The estimated decommissioning provision involves 1) decommissioning costs and 2) assessing the expected remaining 
useful life of relevant assets.The main uncertainties related to the decommissioning costs are the removal method (currently 
assuming reverse installation), the uncertainties around equipment and vessel availability, and market rates at expected time 
of decommissioning. As at 31 December 2022, limited benchmark information was available. Decommissioning costs are 
provided for at the present value of expected costs to settle the obligation. The useful life of the offshore grid connections is 
estimated at 20 till 30 years. For interconnectors the useful life is estimated at 40 years. This provision assumed a discount 
rate between 2.737% and 2.942% was applied for other provisions (2021: between 0.165% and 0.318%) and an inflation 
rate between 2.594% and 2.624% (2021: 2.0%). A change in the discount rate of 1 percent point would have a maximum 
impact of EUR 145 million on the asset value and liability value.
A discount rate of 2.7% was applied for other provisions (2021: 1.5%). A change in discount rate of 1 percent point would 
have a maximum impact of EUR 3 million on the related book value.
The estimated amount of risks associated with delays and interruptions concerning the Group’s offshore activities in 
Germany is based on the number of offshore grid connections and the compensation payable to the operators of offshore 
grid connections.
We are of the opinion that the recorded provisions reflect the best estimate of the probable outflow of resources. However, 
uncertainty about the assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying 
amount of these provisions in future periods.
Due to the business TenneT operates in and TenneT's legal structure, TenneT faces several contingent liabilities. In general, 
the following items are recognised as contingent liabilities at TenneT:
• Possible impact of the Dutch and German regulatory frameworks on the TenneT's business financial conditions and net 
income;
• Operational risks and risks related to material projects;
• Impact of environmental issues;
• Risks relating to the legal structure of TenneT;
• Risks relating to the financing of TenneT;
• Factors which are material for the purpose of assessing market risks.
Uncertainties relating to contingent liabilities make a reliable estimation of the financial impact impossible. For further 
contingent liabilities we refer to note 29.

23 Net employee defined benefit liabilities
Pension plans Germany
We have defined benefit plans for the majority of our German personnel. Said personnel are mainly employed based on the 
collective labour agreement of 'Tarifgruppe Energie' and thus enjoy benefits in the form of old-age, disability and surviving 
dependents' pensions. The large majority of the benefit obligations are based on pension schemes that define annual 
pension claims based on respective employees' pensionable income of a particular year. Furthermore, each employee is 
allowed to defer a certain amount of his compensation to raise his pension claim within defined bounds.
The Group contributes to two post-employment defined benefit plans in Germany, pursuant to a works council agreement 
called ‘Betriebliche Alterssicherung’ (hereafter referred to as ‘pension scheme 2001’) and a works council agreement called 
‘Beitragsplan’ (hereafter referred to as ‘pension scheme 2008’), as well as to a small number of individual pension 
commitments. The pension obligations related to these plans are partly covered by assets held in two Contractual Trust 
Arrangements (CTA) administrated by ‘Helaba Pension Trust e.V.’ (Helaba). According to German law, TenneT remains 
ultimately liable for fulfilling these pension obligations.
Pension scheme 2001
This scheme covers employees who started their employment with TenneT Germany on or before 31 December 2007  
(or later, if the individual employment contract was agreed on or before 1 April 2008). The scheme became effective on  
1 January 2001 and absorbed older plans at the time. As part of the transition in 2001 to the new plan, employees were 
guaranteed a vested pension claim based on the old plan for their years of service prior to the transition date. The plan offers 
benefits in the form of old-age, disability and surviving dependents' pensions and is composed of an employer-funded basic 
level based on the respective employee's yearly pensionable income, an employer-funded top-up level based on the 
respective company's performance and an employee-funded supplementary level which allows employees to increase their 
pension entitlement through deferred compensation. Yearly fixed pension claims are calculated with a fixed internal interest 
rate that sum up to the total earned pension benefits of the respective employee.
Pension scheme 2008
This scheme covers employees who started their employment with TenneT Germany after 31 December 2007 (unless  
the individual employment contract was agreed before 1 April 2008, in which case the pension scheme 2001 applies).  
This scheme offers benefits in the form of old-age, disability and surviving dependents’ pensions.
Pension cost is composed on the employer-funded basic level based on the respective employee’s yearly pensionable 
income, an employer funded top-up level based on the respective company’s performance and an employee-funded 
supplementary level which allows employees to increase their pension entitlement through deferred compensation. If the 
employee contribution to the supplementary level reaches a certain level, the company pays an additional contribution of 
one-third of the respective basic level contribution.
Annually, for each year a contribution to the pension claims is increased with an interest rate that is recalculated based on 
the weighted average current yield of German Federal Government Bonds (Bundesanleihen), with an effective floor of  
3.0% and with different maturities (10, 20 and 30 years) reflecting the average duration of the plan. The annual pension claim 
contributions for all years of service sum up to the total earned pension benefits of the respective employee.
Differences between the plans are limited and refer mainly to the way internal interest rates and the pensionable income are 
determined. Therefore, the disclosure in the notes below comprises the combined plans.

i Accounting policy 
For defined benefit plans, pension costs are determined using the projected unit credit method. Re-measurements, 
comprising of actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling (excluding net interest) and the return on plan assets 
(excluding net interest), are recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Re-measurements 
are not reclassified to the statement of income in subsequent periods.
Service costs comprising current service costs and, if applicable, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and 
non-routine settlements are recognised as personnel expenses in the consolidated statement of income. Interest is 
calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset and is recognised as part of the finance 
result in the statement of income.
Prepaid pension costs relating to defined benefit plans are capitalised only if they lead to refunds to the employer or to 
reductions in future contributions to the plan by the employer.
+ Key estimates and assumptions
Pension obligations and pension entitlements that are known on the reporting date are valued using economic trend 
assumptions including, among others, salary growth rates and pension increase rates, that are intended to reflect realistic 
expectations, as well as variables specific to reporting dates such as discount rates. The principal assumptions used in 
determining the pension obligation were as follows: 
 
2022  2021
Discount rate 3.90% 1.30%
Inflation rate 2.00% 2.00%
Future salary increases 2.50% 2.50%
Future pension increases 2.30% 1.75%
Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics 
and actuarial experience. An increase in each of the main assumptions would have had the followings effects. 
 
(EUR million) 2022  2021
0.25% change of discount rate -11 -26

The sensitivities indicated are computed based on the same methods and assumptions used to determine the present value 
of the defined benefit obligations and are based on variations in a single variable only. Note that the sensitivity analyses may 
not be representative of an actual change in the defined benefit obligation, as it is unlikely that changes in assumptions 
would occur in isolation.
Due to the development of plan assets and the change in (statutory) discount rates, we expect to have no obligation to 
contribute to plan assets in 2023. We expect the following, undiscounted, benefit payments from the plan.

Pension plan the Netherlands
For the majority of our Dutch personnel we have a multi-employer scheme offered by ABP Pension Fund (ABP) in the 
Netherlands. The pension contribution rate for 2022 was 21.53% of the pensionable salary. In 2023 we expect to contribute 
EUR 33 million, based on 2022 number of employees, to the ABP scheme. Compared to the total participants in the ABP 
pension fund, our share in ABP is limited. We are not liable for any deficits in the multi-employer plan.
ABP has indicated that it is unable to provide the kind of company-specific information required by IFRS for defined-benefit 
pension schemes. Consequently, this scheme is treated as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
Since the financial situation of the ABP pension plan at 31 December 2015 was inadequate from a regulatory perspective, 
ABP filed a recovery plan, which was approved by De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) during the course of 2016. In accordance 
with this recovery plan, ABP evaluates how recovery is progressing at the start of each year. Progress is measured by means 
of the policy funding ratio at the end of the preceding year. The policy funding ratio is the 12-month moving average of the 
nominal funding ratio. ABP’s policy funding ratio as at 31 December 2022 was 118.6% (2021: 102.8%) which is above the 
critical regulatory coverage rate level under which pensions would have to be reduced.

Refer to note 15.
Payables in connection with tangible fixed assets purchases
Payables in connection with tangible fixed assets purchases related to unbilled services and deliveries for onshore and 
offshore investment projects.
Interest payable
Interest payable increased due to increased borrowings. These new loans have higher interest rates, which also has impact 
to the increase of interest payable.
Grid expenses payable
The grid expenses payable consisted mainly of accrued expenses for (i) feed-in management and (ii) redispatch measures. 
Grid expenses payable mainly increased due to increased prices for grid expenses due to the war in Ukraine.
+ Key estimates and assumptions
Accrued expenses for measures taken to restore the imbalance of the electricity grid, relate to balancing services provided 
by various electricity generating parties. At year-end, we record an accrual for all balancing costs. The accrual is based on 
actual volumes or, if not available, forecast volumes derived from models. Several assumptions are made in these models 
such as weather conditions, requested volumes and capacity power plant. Prices are based on underlying contracts and/or 
historical data. 
Other payables
Other payables mainly comprised compensation payments to offshore wind farm operators (OWFs), personnel-related 
liabilities and accruals for which invoices had not yet been received. 
+ Key estimates and assumptions
Compensation payments to OWFs are based on amounts of electricity which could not be fed into the grid. The pass-
through accrual is based on a comparison of the costs incurred and the revenue generated by the offshore grid surcharge.

26 Financial risk management
Our business activities are exposed to a number of financial risks such as interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and 
refinancing risk, which are described in detail in this note. Our financial risk management strategy primarily focuses on 
protecting liquidity, equity capital and net result in order to safeguard our ability to continue active operations while providing 
an adequate return to our shareholders. Our approach to managing financial risks, including a number of specific disclosures 
(such as a maturity analysis of contractual undiscounted financial obligations) required by accounting standards, are set out 
in this note. For details about regulatory risks we refer to the 'Corporate Governance' section of our Executive Board report.
Risk management related to financing activities is done by our Treasury department under policies included in the Treasury 
Statute approved by our Executive Board. The Treasury department's objective is to facilitate the realisation of our financial 
and strategic objectives from a funding and financial risk perspective. The Treasury Statute includes principles covering 
specific areas such as interest rate risk, liquidity risk, the use of derivatives and the investment of excess liquidity. The use of 
all ordinary course financial instruments is permitted, provided these are used solely to cover open positions of the Company. 
Any speculative use of financial instruments is explicitly not authorised. 
Interest rate risk
TenneT is exposed to interest rate risk on its debt portfolio. To limit this risk, our policy is to base the majority of our loan 
portfolio on fixed interest rates. As of 31 December 2022, the long-term loan portfolio was for more than 98% based on fixed 
interest rates. An increase or decrease in interest rates of 2 percentage points would result in an increase or decrease of 
EUR 6 million in our interest cost (2021: EUR 15 million).
Furthermore, there is a risk that interest payable on borrowings exceeds the interest compensation received by TenneT under 
the prevailing regulatory systems in the Netherlands and Germany, respectively. In 2022, a new regulatory period started in 
the Netherlands. In Germany, actual interest costs are compensated up to a level customary to the market. The BNetzA 
determines marketability on the basis of reference interest rates published by the Deutsche Bundesbank. Currently we 
expect that actual costs of debt for TenneT are below the predefined maximum reference rates, in which case ACM has 
decided to ex post settle the interest rate for interest rates actually measured in the applicable year of the regulatory period.
Credit risk
TenneT is exposed to the risk of loss resulting from counterparties’ defaulting on their commitments including failure to pay or 
make a delivery on a contract. Our exposure to credit risk from operating activities and treasury activities is inherent to our 
business activities.
Operational credit risk
In respect of our operating activities, TenneT has a credit policy in place, which takes into account the risk profiles of our 
counterparties. We also have policies in place to monitor the financial viability of counterparties.
In both the Netherlands and Germany, TenneT is responsible for maintaining the balance between supply and demand of 
energy. The associated costs are covered by income from parties with balance responsibility, which are charged for any 
imbalances attributable to them. Any surplus is deducted from subsequent tariffs for system services. For certain situations, 
securities in the form of bank guarantees and collaterals are held as protection against the default risk of parties with balance 
responsibility. With respect to investment projects, we require counterparties to deliver bank guarantees or collaterals as a 
protection against defaults.
The management of energy exchanges, the execution of the Renewable Energy Act in Germany and the maintenance of the 
energy balance between supply and demand requires transfer of significant cash amounts. Our policies are aimed at 
minimising the risks associated with the clearing transactions in connection with these cash flows.
Credit risk on trade and other receivables is limited, because most of our trade and other debtors have a low risk of default. 
Consequently, TenneT requires no material collateral as security and no insurance for credit risk. The maximum exposure to 
credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets disclosed in note 13 and 15. The 
movement of the allowance for expected credit losses of trade receivables is included in note 15.

The provision rates for expected credit losses are based on groupings of various customer segments with similar loss 
patterns (such as customer type and arrears in payments). Any expected credit losses for financial guarantee contracts and 
commitment letters (if any) are also provided for. The calculation reflects the probability-weighted outcome, the time value of 
money and reasonable and supportable information that is available at the reporting date about past events, current 
conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. Generally, trade receivables and other financial assets are written-off 
if there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows. The Group considers a financial asset in 
default when contractual payments are 90 days past due. However, in certain cases, TenneT may also consider a financial 
asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding 
contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group. 
Financial credit risk
In 2022, financial credit risk arose mainly from TenneT's transactions and positions with several financial institutions.  
As at 31 December 2022, the maximum credit risk amounted to nil (2021: nil).
In accordance with our treasury policies, counterparty credit exposure is monitored frequently against the counterparty credit 
limits. We have concentration limits in place when funds are placed on deposit or when financial derivatives are entered into. 
At 31 December 2022 we had EUR 301 million at our free disposal for these deposits. These deposits had a maturity of less 
than 3 months (2021: nil), see note 15.
At 31 December 2022 we had EUR 3,300 million deposits with third parties for EEG cash amounts (2021: EUR 2,622 million) 
and no financial derivatives outstanding. As of 31 December 2022 these deposits had a maturity of more than 3 months 
(2021: EUR 472 million), please refer to note 15 and note 16.
Management does not expect any significant losses from non-performance by treasury counterparties.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group cannot meet its short-term financial obligations. Liquidity is monitored every 
quarter on a rolling 12-month forward-looking basis. Our 12-month liquidity objective was met on 31 December 2022 and  
31 December 2021.
The following maturity schedule presents our financial obligations on a contractual, non-discounted basis.

TenneT's borrowings have a diversified maturity profile, which reduces refinancing risks (see also note 20). 
In order to reduce liquidity risk, TenneT has EUR 3.6 billion committed revolving credit facilities (RCFs) at its disposal for 
general corporate purposes. At 31 December 2022, this facility was undrawn. Furthermore, we had EUR 700 million of 
undrawn long-term loan commitments from the EIB available at 31 December 2022, and EUR 1.75 billion committed bilateral 
RCFs (nil drawn at 31 December 2022). Next to that we had EUR 650 million of uncommitted bank facilities (nil million drawn 
at 31 December 2022).
The EEG has a significant impact on TenneT’s working capital position and to prevent negative EEG bank account balances 
and additional short-term bridge financing, a liquidity buffer can be included in the EEG. In accordance with legislation 
(EnFG), shortfalls are reimbursed through government contributions at the latest in the following year.
The size of our credit facilities is such that we expect that all substantial adverse financial developments and events can 
reasonably be expected to be accommodated and that continuation of day-to-day operations is ensured for at least 12 
months. The terms and conditions of our credit facilities include negative pledge and pari passu clauses. No security interest 
over any of the Group’s assets has been provided. All credit facilities have floating-rate interest conditions.
TenneT also has access to diversified funding sources through its medium-term note (EMTN) programme and our 
commercial paper (CP) programme. Both programmes significantly reduce our dependency on bank financing.
TenneT expects to meet its financial obligations for 2023 with (i) cash and cash equivalents, (ii) funds from operations, (iii) 
unused credit facilities, (iv) capital market transactions and (v) equity contributions from our shareholder. We expect to meet 
our financial obligations for the subsequent years through various capital market transactions and equity contributions and 
intend to manage future refinancing risks by spreading the tenors of new financing arrangements. 
Equity risk
There is a risk of a lack of access to equity on a sustainable basis. This risk reflects the inability to raise additional equity in a 
timely fashion in case of unexpectedly large increases in our investment portfolio or negative regulatory developments. 
Actions taken in order to mitigate this risk are: (i) an active financing strategy to create and maintain an optimal capital 
structure as well as to diversify funding sources and manage financial risks, (ii) a proactive approach of potential investors 
and active discussion with our shareholder to contribute additional equity (which effected in EUR 5.11 billion for the period 
2022-2025, see note 18) and (iii) lobbying activities to ensure that regulatory frameworks remain adequate to safeguard 
regulators income and returns to investors.

Commodity price risk
Energy purchase contracts for the forward purchase of electricity that are used to satisfy physical delivery requirements to 
customers, or for energy that the Group uses itself, meet the expected purchase or usage requirements of IFRS 9. They are, 
therefore, not recognised in the financial statements until they are realised. Disclosure of commitments under such contracts 
is made in note 28.
Energy purchase contracts are considered to comprise two components, being a forward purchase of power at spot prices, 
and a forward purchase of environmental certificates at a variable price (being the contract price less the spot power price). 
With respect to our current contracts, neither of these components meets the requirement to be accounted for as a 
derivative. As currently no liquid market for environmental certificates exists, this component meets the expected purchase 
or usage exemption of IFRS 9. We expect to enter into an increasing number of these contracts, in order to meet our 
compliance requirements in the short to medium term. It is possible that in future, if and when liquid markets develop, and to 
the extent that we are in receipt of environmental certificates in excess of our required levels, this exemption may cease to 
apply, and we may be required to account for forward purchase commitments for environmental certificates as derivatives at 
fair value through profit and loss.
27 Fair values
The table below provides an overview of the carrying value and fair value of financial instruments, including IFRS treatment 
and the level in the valuation hierarchy. Instruments are measured at fair value.

Total 19,715 13,705 16,836 14,250
As at 31 December 2022, no instruments carried at fair value were held (2021: nil). Furthermore, we concluded that the fair 
value of the loans and receivables, cash and cash equivalents, account- and other payables and other financial liabilities 
approximate their carrying amounts at year end 2022, due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
The following hierarchy by valuation technique was used to calculate the fair value of assets and liabilities:
• Level 1: Measurement based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
• Level 2: Measurement based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices).
• Level 3: Measurement based on inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, 
unobservable inputs).
The fair value of the level 2 borrowings was based on discounted cash flows. A change in the assumptions used to calculate 
the fair value should not result in a significantly different outcome. There were no transfers between the fair value hierarchy 
levels during 2022 or 2021.

28 i Accounting policies for financial instruments
Financial assets
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction cost.
After initial recognition financial assets are measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI) 
and fair value through profit or loss. All of TenneT's financial assets are classified as amortised cost, because the following 
two conditions are met:
• The financial assets are held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect 
contractual cash flows, and
• The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal 
and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest (EIR) method and are subject to 
impairment.
The Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for financial assets. ECLs are based on the difference 
between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to 
receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. For trade receivables and contract assets, the 
Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but 
instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. 
Financial liabilities
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in case of loans, borrowings and payables, net of directly 
attributable transaction costs. The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings 
including bank overdrafts.
After initial recognition at fair value, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in the statement of income when the liabilities are derecognised as 
well as through the EIR amortisation process. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium 
on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance expense in 
the statement of income.

Total 988 695
The expected cash flows in respect of capital commitments equal the amounts in the above table. For comfort letters issued, 
no cash flows are expected. 
Bank guarantees received and other items
The majority is related to bank guarantees received included guarantees for investment projects. Furthermore, on  
2 September 2022 a short circuit occurred on the newly built substation Dronten and led to a chain of events that caused 
damage to various parties. For the estimated costs we have recognised a current provision. The damages have been 
reported to the insurance companies and are estimated to be covered.
Comfort letters received
The majority of comfort letters received was from parties involved in the construction of German onshore and offshore 
projects. 
Capital commitments
Capital commitments are commitments entered into with regard to the purchase of tangible fixed assets. Approximately  
EUR 4.4 billion of capital commitments were payable within 12 months, as at 31 December 2022 (2021: EUR 4.0 billion).
Comfort letters issued
The comfort letters issued mainly related to offshore projects in Germany.
Grid related commitments
Grid-related commitments included unused auction receipts, received in the Netherlands amounting to EUR 86 million  
(2021: EUR 136 million).

Other off-balance sheet commitments mainly consisted of:
• Compensation claimed by several parties for the delay or non-availability of the offshore grid connection. The related legal 
proceedings are still pending. If and to the extent the claims are (partly) justified and the payments resulting therefrom 
could not be passed through to the end customers, the binding rulings may have a negative impact on the financial 
position;
• Capital commitments to minority participating interests;
• TenneT TSO B.V. is currently involved in a claim procedure because of alleged wrongful termination of construction 
contracts and in a counter claim procedure against this counter party regarding financial settlement & damages due to  
the alleged non-fulfilment of the construction contracts.
For these items, it is not practically possible to determine the financial effect and possible timing of cash outflows and cash 
inflows. 
Various other off-balance sheet commitments and contingencies as well as other off-balance sheet rights existed as of  
31 December 2022 but were immaterial from a disclosure perspective. The majority of these claims related to (i) construction 
contracts and planning damage where additional payments would be capitalised, or (ii) claims relating to compensation for 
delays and interruptions where any compensation would be pass-through for TenneT or (iii) claims relating to refunds of 
transmission services, which would be compensated in future tariffs. In the unlikely event that these claims would prevail in 
court, this could have a material impact on the Company’s financial situation.
Electricity Revenue Cap Act
The Electricity Revenue Cap Act (‘Strompreisbremsegesetz, StromPBG’) was passed by the German legislator on  
20 December 2022 and went into force on 24 December in the same year. It aims to protect domestic end-consumers in 
2023 from strongly increased electricity prices resulting from the turmoil on the energy markets in Europe following the 
Ukraine war Energy suppliers will process the price caps in their individual invoices with end-consumers. The aggregated 
financial impact of this will be paid out starting in the first quarter of 2023 by the TSOs to the energy suppliers on the basis of 
aggregated volume data. The TSOs are compensated for these payments by direct transfers from the government and by 
funds received from electricity generators. To enable the process, detailed rules for the calculation of excess revenues from 
generators as well as for the settlement and pay out to end-consumers are determined in the law. Furthermore, the German 
regulator BNetzA has an oversight role in the process. Payments from TSOs to end-consumers via the energy suppliers 
started in February 2023 with retroactive effect as per January. First governmental transfer payments to bridge finance 
occurred in February 2023. The first inflow of excess revenues from generators is expected for mid of August 2023. TSOs do 
not expect any liquidity or profitability risks from the regime which they perform as trustees of society and on a pass-through 
basis.
As per 31 December 2022 no reliable estimate could be made of the to be received overprofit of December 2022 and as 
such the receivable and corresponding liability are both not recognised in the financial statements. There is no impact on the 
results and equity per 31 December 2022.
Environmental obligations
The Group is exposed to risks regarding environmental obligations arising from past activities. For example, a number of 
sites have to be decontaminated and restored to their original condition before being handed back at the end of the 
contractual period. Under current legislation, environmental plans and any other measures to be adopted have to be agreed 
with local, regional and national authorities as appropriate. As soon as such plans are approved or other legal obligations 
arise, a provision is formed based on the most reliable estimate possible of future expenses. TenneT is of the opinion that the 
currently recognised provisions are adequate, based on information currently available.

***  WL Winet GmbH exists since 2016 but never showed a positive result. Although sales were increasing, management didn't expect an improvement 
of the result due to the lack of finding qualified personnel. Therefore, it was decided to liquidate WL Winet GmbH. The liquidation commenced on  
1 March 2019. Effective 18 March 2022, WL Winet GmbH has been liquidated.
****  On 27 June 2022 the Group sold all its shares of ETPA Holding B.V. with a limited result.  
*****  Per 31 December 2022 CertiQ B.V. merged with Vertogas B.V. into VertiCer B.V. which is a joint venture per the same date, reference is made to note 11.
As TenneT is able to exercise direct control over its management and financial and operational policies, Stichting Beheer 
Doelgelden Landelijk Hoogspanningsnet, a foundation which temporarily manages funds arising from the maintenance of the 
energy balance and auctioning of cross-border capacity by TenneT TSO B.V., is included in the consolidation. 
As TenneT is able to exercise direct control over its management and financial and operational policies, Greennet Stiftung, 
the foundation that compensate negative impact due to construction work of TenneT in our German grid is included in the 
consolidation.
32 Events after the reporting period
On 10 February 2023, TenneT announced that it intends to engage in discussions with the German government, to  
explore the possibility of a full sale of TenneT’s German activities on acceptable terms. On 24 February 2023 the Dutch 
government decided to further investigate a full sale as the preferred option. TenneT acknowledges that its sole shareholder 
the Dutch government has not yet taken any final decision, and TenneT will take the next steps in close collaboration with  
the government.

Notes to the company financial statements
These notes contain information about the company financial statements of TenneT Holding B.V. 
Details related to TenneT Holding B.V.'s financial results and position are provided, as well as  
a description of the specific accounting policies applied when compiling these company 
financial statements. 
33 Company accounting policies
The company financial statements for TenneT Holding B.V. have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of Part 9  
of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. The same principles governing valuation and the determination of results (including the 
principles governing the classification of financial instruments as equity or liability) have been applied when compiling the 
company financial statements and the consolidated financial statements, as permitted by Article 2:362, clause 8 of the Dutch 
Civil Code.
Expected credit loss (ECL) provisions for receivables from subsidiaries have been eliminated as intercompany positions. 
Changes in these ECL provisions may impact the carrying amounts of the financial assets in the company statement of the 
financial position due to a possible provision. This may result in a difference between the company's equity and the 
consolidated equity. No ECL provision was deemed necessary.
34 Finance income
Finance income was mainly related to the interest received on intercompany loans and other in- house financing activities  
(see note 39). The intercompany agreements have terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm’s length transactions.
35 Finance expenses
Finance expenses mainly related to interest on borrowings and credit facilities (2022: EUR 245 million; 2021: EUR 175 million). 
This increase is related to increased interest rates and increased borrowings.
36 Personnel expenses
TenneT Holding B.V. did not employ any personnel during 2022 or 2021, and as a result did not incur any personnel expenses 
in those periods. Members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of the Company received their remuneration, as 
disclosed in note 4 of the consolidated financial statements, from other entities within the Group.
37 Investments in subsidiaries
Changes in investments in subsidiaries can be broken down as follows: 
 
(EUR million) 2022 2021

financial statements.

i Accounting policies
Investments in subsidiaries are measured at net asset value. The net asset value of a participating interest is determined by 
valuing assets, provisions and liabilities and calculating the result using the accounting principles applied to the consolidated 
financial statements.
When TenneT's share of losses in an investment equals or exceeds its interest on investment (including separately presented 
goodwill or any other unsecured non-current receivables, as part of the net investment) it does not recognise any further 
losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of this investment. In such case, 
TenneT will recognise a provision.
38 Investments in joint ventures and associates
Investments in joint ventures and associates related to HGRT. In 2022, TenneT's share in HGRT's result amounted to  
EUR 4 million (2021: EUR 4 million) and EUR 4 million (2021: EUR 3 million) dividends were received. Further reference is 
made to note 12 of the consolidated financial statements. 
39 Other financial assets
(EUR million) 2022 2021
Receivables from subsidiaries 17,394 12,843
Minority participating interests 15 14
Other financial assets 3 4
Total 17,412 12,861
In relation to the minority participating interests reference is made to note 13 of the consolidated financial statements.

Independent auditor’s report
 
To: the Shareholder and the Supervisory Board of TenneT Holding B.V. (“TenneT” or the “Company”)
Report on the audit of the financial statements 2022 included in the integrated annual report
Our opinion
We have audited the financial statements 2022 of TenneT, based in Arnhem, the Netherlands (the “Financial Statements”). 
The Financial Statements comprise the consolidated financial statements and the company financial statements.
In our opinion:
• the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of TenneT as at  
31 December 2022, and of its result and its cash flows for 2022 in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”) and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code; and
• the accompanying company financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of TenneT as at  
31 December 2022, and of its result for 2022 in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
The consolidated financial statements comprise:
1. the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2022;
2. the following statements for 2022: the consolidated statement of income, the consolidated statements of comprehensive 
income, changes in equity and cash flows; and
3. the notes comprising a summary of the accounting policies and other explanatory information.
The company financial statements comprise:
1. the company statement of financial position as at 31 December 2022;
2. the company statement of income for 2022;
3. the notes comprising a summary of the accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Basis for our opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the 'Our responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements' section of our report.
We are independent of TenneT in accordance with the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of 
public-interest entities, the ‘Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties’ (Audit firms supervision act), the ‘Verordening inzake de 
onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten’ (Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with 
respect to independence) and other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied 
with the ‘Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants’ (Dutch Code of Ethics).
We believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Information in support of our opinion
We designed our audit procedures in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole and in forming our 
opinion thereon. The following information in support of our opinion was addressed in this context, and we do not provide  
a separate opinion or conclusion on these matters.
Materiality
Based on our professional judgement we determined the materiality for the Financial Statements as a whole at EUR 60 million 
(2021: EUR 55 million). The materiality is based on 7% of the average underlying operating profit for the years 2022, 2021 
and 2020. We have also taken into account misstatements and/or possible misstatements that in our opinion are material for 
the users of the Financial Statements for qualitative reasons.

Independent auditor’s report**

Page 186:
Component audits are performed using the materiality levels determined by the judgement of the group engagement team, 
considering materiality for the consolidated financial statements as a whole and the reporting structure of the group. For the 
largest reporting entities, the audits are performed using the following component materiality levels:
• TenneT TSO GmbH & Co. KG (“TSO DE”): of EUR 40.8 million (2021: EUR 37 million);
• TenneT TSO B.V. (“TSO NL”): EUR 26.4 million (2021: EUR 24 million); and
• TenneT Holding B.V.: EUR 24 million (2021: EUR 22 million).
For the other reporting entities, the component materiality levels did not exceed EUR 12 million (2021: EUR 11 million).
We agreed with the Supervisory Board that misstatements in excess of EUR 3 million (2021: EUR 2.75 million), which are 
identified during the audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements that in our view must be reported  
on qualitative grounds.
Scope of the group audit
TenneT is at the head of a group of entities. The financial information of this group is included in the consolidated financial 
statements of TenneT.
Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are responsible for directing, supervising and performing the group 
audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for reporting 
entities. Decisive were the size and/or the risk profile of the reporting entities or operations. On this basis, we selected 
reporting entities for which an audit had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or specific items.
In establishing the overall group audit strategy and plan, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed at  
the components by the group engagement team and the component auditors.
Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the 
audit work at those components to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence was obtained as a 
basis for our opinion on the Financial Statements as a whole. For each component we determined whether we required an 
audit of their complete financial information or whether other procedures would be sufficient.
Our group audit mainly focused on the significant group entities TenneT Holding B.V., TSO DE and TSO NL, because 
combined they make up more than 90% of the group’s revenue, underlying operating profit and assets. We included 
additional reporting entities in the scope of our group audit to have additional audit coverage on the group’s consolidated 
financial statements, and performed other procedures with respect to residual risk in components and account balances that 
have not been included in audit scope.
The group consolidation, Financial Statements disclosures and certain centrally coordinated accounting topics were audited 
by the group engagement team. These topics included among others treasury and corporate income tax. Team members 
with specialized knowledge were involved in the areas of tax, accounting, valuation, pension and information technology.
We have obtained the following audit coverage of the group with our audit procedures: 
Audit coverage
Revenue 99%
Underlying operating profit 98%
Assets 99%

We have:
• Performed audit procedures ourselves at group entities;
• Used the work of other auditors when auditing; and
• Performed review procedures or specific audit procedures at other group entities.
By performing the procedures mentioned above at group entities, together with additional procedures at group level, we 
have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence about the group's financial information to provide an 
opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
Audit approach fraud risks
Description
An auditor conducting an audit in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing is responsible for obtaining reasonable 
assurance that the Financial Statements taken as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that some material misstatements of the 
Financial Statements may not be detected. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher 
than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control.
We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism throughout our audit in identifying 
and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the Financial Statements due to fraud, designing and performing audit 
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion.
Our response
We performed the following procedures:
• In identifying potential risks of material misstatement due to fraud, we obtained an understanding of TenneT and its 
environment, including its internal controls. We evaluated TenneT’s fraud risk assessment and made inquiries with 
management, those charged with governance and others within TenneT, including but not limited to the units (i) Internal 
Audit, (ii) Compliance & Integrity and (iii) Financial Governance Services. We evaluated several fraud risks factors to 
consider whether those factors indicated a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
• Following these procedures, and the presumed risks under the prevailing auditing standards, we considered the fraud 
risks in relation to management override of controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the 
Supervisory Board, the Executive Board and other members of management, which may represent a risk of material 
misstatement due to fraud. As part of the fraud risk of management override of controls, we identified a significant risk 
due to fraud related to classification of operational expenditure as capitalized expenditure given the differences in related 
regulatory accounting and thus future revenues.
• We made inquiries of management, those charged with governance and others within TenneT regarding the risk of 
material misstatements in the Financial Statements due to fraud, their process for identifying and responding to the risk of 
fraud, the internal communication regarding their views on business practices and ethical behaviour and whether they 
have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud affecting the Company.
• We held discussions amongst team members and component auditors to identify fraud risk factors and considered 
whether other information obtained from our risk assessment procedures indicated risks of material misstatement due to 
fraud. Fraud risk factors identified include among others: 
• fraud, bribery and corruption;
• compliance with respect to trade regulations/sanctions;
• compliance with respect to environmental requirements; and
• compliance with procurement policies.
• We evaluated whether unusual or unexpected relationships have been identified in performing analytical procedures, that 
may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud.
• We involved forensic specialists, focused on our fraud and non-compliance risk assessment, inquiries with management, 
the evaluation of the internal control environment and in determining the audit response.

• We determined overall responses to address the assessed risks of material misstatement due to fraud at the financial 
statement level or at the assertion level by: 
• assigning and supervising personnel with the adequate knowledge, skills and ability; evaluating whether the selection 
and application of accounting policies by the group, particularly those related to subjective measurements and 
complex transactions, may be indicative of fraudulent financial reporting;
• incorporating an element of unpredictability in the selection of the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures. 
Among others, these include the selection of fixed asset project tested, expense sampling selection criteria and 
(physical) asset inspection;
• testing the appropriateness of journal entries recorded in the general ledger and other adjustments made in the 
preparation of the Financial Statements;
• evaluating whether the judgments and decisions made by management in making the accounting estimates included 
in the Financial Statements indicate a possible bias that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions that might have a major impact on the Financial 
Statements are disclosed in note 1 of the consolidated Financial Statements. Useful life of assets, grid expense 
payables and the provision for decommissioning were focus areas in our audit as the related account balances are 
subject to significant management judgment. Reference is made to the section “Our key audit matters”; and
• performing a retrospective review of management judgments and assumptions related to significant accounting 
estimates such as cost assumptions on the decommissioning provisions and in-feed management accruals reflected  
in prior year Financial Statements.We considered available information and made enquiries of relevant executives, 
directors and the Supervisory Board.
Based on our procedures performed we have no matters to report.
This did not lead to indications for fraud potentially resulting in material misstatements.
Audit approach compliance with laws and regulations
Description
We are responsible for obtaining reasonable assurance that the Financial Statements, taken as a whole, are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error taking into account the applicable legal and regulatory framework. 
However, we are not responsible for preventing non-compliance and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all 
laws and regulations.
Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that some material misstatements in the Financial 
Statements may not be detected, even though the audit is properly planned and performed in accordance with the auditing 
standards. In the context of laws and regulations, the potential effects of inherent limitations on the auditor’s ability to detect 
material misstatements are greater for such reasons as the following:
• There are many laws and regulations, relating principally to the operating aspects of an entity, that typically do not affect 
the Financial Statements and are not captured by the entity’s information systems relevant to financial reporting.
• Non-compliance may involve conduct designed to conceal it, such as collusion, forgery, deliberate failure to record 
transactions, management override of controls or intentional misrepresentations being made to the auditor.
• Whether an act constitutes non-compliance is ultimately a matter to be determined by a court or other appropriate 
adjudicative body.
Ordinarily, the less directly non-compliance is linked to the events and transactions reflected in the Financial Statements, the 
less likely the auditor is to become aware of it or to identify the non-compliance.

Our response
We performed the following procedures:
• As part of obtaining an understanding of TenneT and its environment we obtained a general understanding of the legal and 
regulatory framework applicable to TenneT and the industry in which it operates and how TenneT is complying with that 
framework.
• We assessed the laws and regulations relevant to the Company through discussion with management, those charged with 
governance and others within TenneT, including but not limited to the units (i) Internal Audit, Risk & Internal Control and 
Compliance & Integrity, (ii) Legal Affairs, (iii) Regulatory Affairs and (iv) Financial Governance Services. We have read related 
minutes and reports. We involved our forensic specialists in our evaluation.
• We obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding provisions of those laws and regulations generally recognized to 
have a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the Financial Statements such as (corporate) 
tax and pension laws and financial reporting regulations, the requirements under IFRS and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil 
Code.
• Apart from these, TenneT is subject to other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a 
material effect on amounts and/or disclosures in the Financial Statements, for instance, through imposing fines or litigation. 
Given the nature of TenneT’s business and the complexity of energy laws and regulations in the Netherlands and Germany, as 
well as environmental laws, there is a risk of non-compliance with the requirements of such laws and regulations. In addition, 
we considered relevant laws and regulations applicable to listed companies.
• Our procedures are more limited with respect to other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the 
determination of the amounts and disclosures in the Financial Statements. These laws and regulations compliance may be 
fundamental to the operating aspects of the business, to TenneT’s ability to continue its business, or to avoid material 
penalties (e.g., compliance with the terms energy laws in the Netherlands and Germany or compliance with environmental 
regulations) and therefore non-compliance with such laws and regulations may have a material effect on the Financial 
Statements. Our responsibility is limited to undertaking specified audit procedures to help identify non-compliance with those 
laws and regulations that may have a material effect on the Financial Statements.
• Our procedures are limited to (i) inquiry of the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board and others within TenneT as to whether 
the Company is in compliance with such laws and regulations and (ii) inspecting correspondence, if any, with the relevant 
licensing or regulatory authorities to help identify non-compliance with those laws and regulations that may have a material 
effect on the Financial Statements.We remained alert to indications of (suspected) non-compliance throughout the audit.
• We obtained written representations that all known instances of (suspected) fraud or non-compliance with laws and 
regulations have been disclosed to us.
Based on our procedures, we have no matters to report.
Audit approach going concern
Description
We are responsible for obtaining reasonable assurance that the Company is able to continue as a going concern. Management 
is responsible to assess the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and disclosing in the Financial Statements any 
events or circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
As described in note 1, the Executive Board believes that no events or conditions give rise to doubt about the ability of the 
Company to continue in operation in the next reporting period.
Our response
We performed the following procedures:
• We evaluated management’s assessment of the going concern assumption and related disclosure note 1 of the Financial 
Statements.
• We challenged management’s cash flow forecasts and primary assumptions, also in the light of our understanding obtained 
with regards to management’s outlook as reported in the Director’s Report.
• We audited the Company’s capital management objectives, including its long-term credit rating and liquidity on a rolling 
12-month forward looking basis as disclosed in note 17.
• We audited the Company’s repayment obligations as disclosed in note 26.

Our key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the Financial 
Statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the Supervisory Board. The key audit matters are not a 
comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed. The key audit matters are consistent with prior year.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Tangible fixed assets
Description
Securing supply and facilitating the integration of sustainable energy sources into the high-voltage grid require substantial 
investments and flexible access to (equity) funding. TenneT expects to increase its annual investment volume to at least  
EUR 8 billion in on- and offshore grid connections.
We have included this as a key audit matter because of:
• the financial significance of the tangible fixed assets and related capital expenditures;
• the risks associated with large investment projects, complexity in procurement, construction and timely completion;
• the professional judgment required in determining the impact of the energy transition on (i) (funding) the capital investment 
planning, and (ii) the existing asset portfolio, including the assessment of remaining useful lives of assets; and
• the professional judgement required in (i) assessing whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired and (ii) if 
there is any such indication, estimating the recoverable amount of that asset (i.e., measuring any impairment).
Our response
We performed the following procedures:
• We tested the internal control environment related to tangible fixed assets through testing of operating effectiveness of 
relevant controls, including controls related to (i) investment approval, (ii) the financial closing of assets under construction, 
and (iii) the periodic determination of the useful lives of tangible fixed assets.
• We tested the design and implementation of relevant controls related to TenneT’s liquidity forecast underpinning its ability to 
finance investments.
• We obtained and discussed internal management reports about progress of the key assets under construction and 
performed tests of details on the additions to and other movements in tangible fixed assets.
• We evaluated management’s estimation of the useful lives of tangible fixed assets based on economic, regulatory and 
technical data.
• We evaluated management’s assessment that no indications were identified that any assets may be impaired as at  
31 December 2022.
Our observations
Our procedures did not identify material observations and we considered management’s key assumptions, to be within the 
reasonable range of our own expectations.
Provision for decommissioning of (offshore) assets
Description
Decommissioning of offshore assets will be an important topic over the next 30+ years for TenneT as a large part of its assets 
come to the end of their useful life. Furthermore, moving towards a renewable future involves significant investments in 
offshore assets, requiring recognition of new provisions. The corresponding provisions are based on estimates of costs, timing 
of decommissioning, discount rates and inflation.
We have included this as a key audit matter because of:
• the significance of the provision and additions for the year triggered by the start of construction of new (offshore) assets; 
and

• the uncertainty involved in measuring the provision and sensitivity to changes in key assumptions, including the cost base, 
the inflation rate and the discount rate.
Our response
We have obtained management’s position papers on the cost assumptions and alignment of the methodology across the 
Netherlands and Germany. Our audit procedures included testing of design and implementation of relevant controls around 
the periodical assessment of these assumptions and the evaluation of the financial model used to calculate the provision.
Our substantive audit procedures further include an assessment of the reasonability of the key assumptions through 
comparison with observable market data and procedures to address the completeness of the provision.
Furthermore, we evaluated the appropriateness of the disclosure of the accounting policy and estimation uncertainty of these 
provisions.
Our observations
Our procedures did not identify material observations and we considered management’s key assumptions, to be within the 
reasonable range of our own expectations.
Accrual for in-feed management expenses
Description
Due to a larger share of renewable energy production in Germany, supply of energy may sometimes exceed demand. In 
such instances, TenneT initiates redispatch measures to maintain the energy balance on its grids at 50 Hertz. If there is no 
redispatch possibility on the transmission grid, TenneT will direct distribution system operators to curtail producers of 
(renewable) electricity to secure system stability. These producers are then entitled to reimbursement for their lost in-feed.
We have included this as a key audit matter because the accrual for in-feed management is significant and subject to 
estimation uncertainty in assessing variable renewable energy production, where TenneT is dependent on information from 
other market participants.
Moreover, final settlement of in-feed management measures may take up to six years to resolve due to regulatory terms.
Our response
We obtained an understanding of the external factors and market processes that drive the estimation uncertainty, including 
an evaluation on the correlation between average wind developments and in-feed management expenses for 2022 and the 
previous periods.
We have tested the internal control environment related to the in-feed management expenses by testing design and 
implementation of relevant controls. This includes an assessment of the methodology applied by TenneT to estimate the 
accrual at reporting date.
We performed the following combination of substantive testing procedures:
• we tested quantity (GWh) and pricing data of the accrual estimation with underlying contract and counterparty quantity 
data;
• we performed back-testing of historical estimates, primarily aimed to test quantity estimations (GWh) with the use of 
observable market data, as well as the pricing estimations of the transactions based on contracts; and
• we evaluated underlying drivers of historical estimate updates to the current period estimates.
Our observations
Our procedures did not identify material observations and we considered management’s key assumptions (quantity and 
price) to be within the reasonable range of our expectations.

Report on the other information included in the Integrated Annual Report
The Integrated Annual Report contains other information, in addition to the Financial Statements and our auditor’s report 
thereon.
1. Director’s Report, consisting of:
a. About TenneT;
b. Our Performance in 2022;
c. Corporate Governance; and
d. EU Taxonomy disclosures.
2. Supervisory Board Report.
3. Other Information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
4. Other information included in the Integrated Annual Report.
Based on the following procedures performed, we conclude that the other information:
1. is consistent with the Financial Statements and does not contain material misstatements; and
2. contains all the information regarding the director’s report and the other information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the 
Dutch Civil Code.
We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained through our audit of the Financial 
Statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the other information contains material misstatements.
By performing these procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and the 
Dutch Standard on Auditing 720. The scope of the procedures performed is substantially less than the scope of those 
performed in our audit of the Financial Statements.
Management is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including the Director’s Report in accordance with 
Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, and the other information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. 
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements and ESEF
Engagement
We were engaged by the annual meeting of shareholders as auditor of TenneT on 18 December 2019, as of the audit for the 
year 2020 and have operated as statutory auditor ever since that financial year.
No prohibited non-audit services
We have not provided prohibited non-audit services as referred to in Article 5(1) of the EU Regulation on specific 
requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities.
European Single Electronic Format (“ESEF”)
TenneT has prepared its annual report in ESEF. The requirements for this are set out in the Commission Delegated Regulation 
(EU) 2019/815 with regard to regulatory technical standards on the specification of a single electronic reporting format (the 
“RTS on ESEF”).
In our opinion, the annual report, prepared in XHTML format, including the (partly) marked-up consolidated financial 
statements, as included in the reporting package by TenneT complies in all material respects with the RTS on ESEF.
Management is responsible for preparing the annual report including the Financial Statements in accordance with the RTS 
on ESEF, whereby management combines the various components into a single reporting package.
Our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance for our opinion whether the annual report in this reporting package 
complies with the RTS on ESEF.

We performed our examination in accordance with Dutch law, including Dutch Standard 3950N “Assurance-opdrachten 
inzake het voldoen aan de criteria voor het opstellen van een digitaal verantwoordingsdocument” (assurance engagements 
relating to compliance with criteria for digital reporting).
Our examination included amongst others:
• Obtaining an understanding of the Company's financial reporting process, including the preparation of the reporting 
package.
• Identifying and assessing the risks that the annual report does not comply in all material respects with the RTS on ESEF 
and designing and performing further assurance procedures responsive to those risks to provide a basis for our opinion, 
including: 
• obtaining the reporting package and performing validations to determine whether the reporting package containing the 
Inline XBRL instance and the XBRL extension taxonomy files has been prepared in accordance with the technical 
specifications as included in the RTS on ESEF; and
• examining the information related to the consolidated financial statements in the reporting package to determine 
whether all required mark-ups have been applied and whether these are in accordance with the RTS on ESEF.
Description of responsibilities regarding the Financial Statements
Responsibilities of management and the Supervisory Board for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS and 
Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Furthermore, management is responsible for such internal control as management 
determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
As part of the preparation of the Financial Statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to 
continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting frameworks mentioned, management should prepare the 
Financial Statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the 
company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Our responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements
Our objective is to plan and perform the audit assignment in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit 
evidence for our opinion.
Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not detect all material 
errors and fraud during our audit.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial Statements. The 
materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified 
misstatements on our opinion.
We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit, in accordance 
with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. Our audit included among others:
• Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is 
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control.
• Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal 
control.
• Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by management.

• Concluding on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting, and based on the 
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant 
doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are 
required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the Financial Statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 
date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a 
going concern.
• Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the Financial Statements, including the disclosures.
• Evaluating whether the Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves 
fair presentation.
We communicated with the Supervisory Board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit 
and significant audit findings, including any significant findings in internal control that we identified during our audit. In this 
respect we also submitted an additional report to the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee in accordance with Article 11 
of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities. The information included in 
this additional report is consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor's report.

Limited assurance report of the independent auditor 
with respect to the 2022 Sustainability Information of 
TenneT Holding B.V.
 
To:     the Shareholder and the Supervisory Board of TenneT Holding B.V.
Our conclusion
We have reviewed the sustainability information included in the Integrated Annual Report for the year 2022 (“IAR”), of  
TenneT Holding B.V. (“TenneT”) based in Arnhem (the “Sustainability Information”). Our procedures did not cover the 
information set out in the section “Box out: The application of the EU Taxonomy at TenneT” on page 70. A review is aimed at 
obtaining a limited level of assurance. 
 
Based on our review nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Sustainability Information does not 
present, in all material respects, a reliable and adequate view of:
• the policy and business operations with regard to Sustainability; and
• the thereto related events and achievements for the year 2022 
in accordance with the reporting criteria as included in the “Reporting criteria” section of our report.
The Sustainability Information consists of the performance information in the chapters “2022 at a glance”, “Letter from the 
Board”, “About TenneT”, “Our Performance in 2022” (excluding the sections “Safeguard sustainable financial performance 
and investor ratings” and “Statements of the Executive Board”) and the section “About this report” in the IAR.
Basis for our conclusion
We have performed our review of the Sustainability Information in accordance with Dutch law, including Dutch Standard 
3810N “Assurance-opdrachten inzake maatschappelijke verslagen” (Assurance engagements relating to sustainability 
reports) which is a specified Dutch Standard that is based on the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 
3000 “Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information”. This assurance engagement 
is aimed at obtaining limited assurance. Our responsibilities under this standard are further described in the section “Our 
responsibilities for the review of the Sustainability Information” section of our report.
We are independent of TenneT in accordance with the “Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij 
assurance-opdrachten” (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and 
other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. This includes that we do not perform any activities that could 
result in a conflict of interest with our independent assurance engagement. Furthermore we have complied with the 
“Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants” (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics). 
We believe that the assurance evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.
Reporting criteria
The reporting criteria used for the preparation of the Sustainability Information are the Sustainability Reporting Standards of 
the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) and the applied supplemental reporting criteria as disclosed in the chapter “About the 
report” of the IAR.
The Sustainability Information is prepared with reference to the GRI Standards. The GRI Standards used are listed in the GRI 
Content Index as disclosed on page 199 of the IAR.
The absence of an established practice on which to draw, to evaluate and measure non-financial information allows for 
different, but acceptable, measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities and over time.
Consequently, the Sustainability Information needs to be read and understood together with the reporting criteria used.

Materiality
Based on our professional judgement we determined materiality levels for each relevant part of the sustainability information 
and for the sustainability information as a whole. When evaluating our materiality levels, we have taken into account 
quantitative and qualitative considerations as well as the relevance of information for both stakeholders and the company.
Limitations to the scope of our review
The Sustainability Information includes prospective information such as ambitions, strategy, plans, expectations, estimates 
and risk assessments. As discussed in the section “Climate related risks and opportunities” on page 110 of the IAR, the 
Sustainability Information includes information based on climate-related scenarios that is subject to inherent uncertainty 
because of incomplete scientific and economic knowledge about the likelihood, timing or effect of possible future climate-
related impacts. Inherent to prospective information, the actual future results are uncertain. We do not provide any assurance 
on the assumptions and achievability of prospective information in the Sustainability Information.
The references to external sources or websites in the Sustainability Information are not part of the Sustainability Information 
as reviewed by us. We therefore do not provide assurance on this information. Our conclusion is not modified in respect to 
these matters.
Responsibilities of management and the Supervisory Board for the Sustainability Information
Management is responsible for the preparation of reliable and adequate Sustainability Information in accordance with the 
reporting criteria as included in the ‘Reporting criteria’ section, including the identification of stakeholders and the definition of 
material matters. Management is also responsible for selecting and applying the reporting criteria and for determining that 
these reporting criteria are suitable for the legitimate information needs of stakeholders, taking into account applicable law 
and regulations related to reporting. The choices made by management regarding the scope of the Sustainability Information 
and the reporting policy are summarised in the chapter ‘Our strategy and value creation’ of the IAR.
Furthermore, management is responsible for such internal control as it determines is necessary to enable the preparation of 
the Sustainability Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the reporting process of TenneT.
Our responsibilities for the review of the Sustainability Information
Our responsibility is to plan and perform the review in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence 
to provide a basis for our conclusion.
Procedures performed to obtain a limited level of assurance are aimed to determine the plausibility of information and vary in 
nature and timing from, and are less in extent, than for a reasonable assurance engagement. The level of assurance obtained 
in review is therefore substantially less than the assurance obtained in an audit.
We apply the “Nadere voorschriften kwaliteitssystemen” (NVKS, regulations for quality management systems) and 
accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding 
compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and other relevant legal and regulatory requirements.
We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional skepticism throughout the review, in 
accordance with the Dutch Standard 3810N, ethical requirements and independence requirements.

Our review included among others:
• Performing an analysis of the external environment and obtaining an understanding of relevant social themes and issues, 
and the characteristics of TenneT.
• Evaluating the appropriateness of the reporting criteria used, their consistent application and related disclosures in the 
Sustainability Information. This includes the evaluation of the results of the stakeholders” dialogue and the reasonableness 
of estimates made by management.
• Obtaining through inquiries a general understanding of control environment, processes and information systems relevant 
to the preparation of the Sustainability Information, but not to obtain assurance evidence about their implementation or 
their operating effectiveness.
• Identifying areas of the Sustainability Information with a higher risk of misleading or unbalanced information or material 
misstatements, whether due to fraud or error. Designing and performing further assurance procedures aimed at 
determining the plausibility of the Sustainability Information responsive to this risk analysis. These procedures consisted 
amongst others of:
• interviewing management, KPI owners and/or other relevant staff at corporate and business level responsible for the 
sustainability strategy, policy and results;
• interviewing relevant staff responsible for providing the information for, carrying out internal control procedures on, and 
consolidating the data in the Sustainability Information; 
• determining the nature and extent of the review procedures for KPI’s. For this, the nature, extent and/or risk profile of 
the KPI’s are decisive. Based thereon we selected the KPI owners or other relevant staff whom we have interviewed. 
• obtaining assurance information that the Sustainability Information reconciles with underlying records of TenneT;
• reviewing, on a limited test basis, relevant internal and external documentation; and 
performing an analytical review of the data and trends.
• Evaluating the consistency of the Sustainability Information with the information in the IAR which is not included in the 
scope of our review.
• Evaluating the presentation, structure and content of the Sustainability Information.
• Considering whether the Sustainability Information as a whole, including the disclosures, reflects the purpose of the 
reporting criteria used. 
We communicated with management and the Supervisory Board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope, timing 
and outcome of the review and significant findings that we identified during our review.

About this report
Scope of this report
The scope of this report is TenneT Holding B.V. and the subsidiaries in which it has a controlling interest (generally speaking a 
voting interest of over 50%). For example, our 50% stake in BritNed and BritNed’s activities are not included in our results. 
This integrated report covers the full year 2022, i.e. 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022. TenneT’s Integrated Annual 
Report 2022 was published on 14 March 2023 and is available online.
In 2022, there were no significant acquisitions or divestments impacting our non-financial reporting. In addition, our 
subsidiary CertiQ B.V. merged with Vertogas B.V., a subsidiary of Gasunie N.V., into VertiCer B.V. and this had no significant 
impact on our non-financial reporting. A complete overview of all the consolidated entities in this Integrated Annual Report is 
disclosed in note 31 of the consolidated financial statements. Our reporting policy in the event of acquisitions or divestments 
is disclosed in notes 1, 11 and 12 of the consolidated financial statements. For non-financial performance we report 
acquisitions and divestments from the day of purchase or when an entity is sold respectively. We recognise that in the event 
of acquisitions, reporting improvements may be required which may result in data being estimated.
Reporting principles
Our non-financial qualitative and quantitative information is prepared with reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 
Universal Standards. In absence of sector guidance, we also adhere to the sector guidelines for our industry (G4 sector 
disclosures - electric utilities). For more information, please refer to the reporting guidance document on our corporate 
website. 
The GRI context index, as included on our corporate website, shows which GRI aspects are material to TenneT and refers to 
those sections in the report describing this aspect. In addition, and in accordance with the policy on state-owned companies 
(Nota Deelnemingenbeleid Rijksoverheid 2022), TenneT complies with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, as laid down 
in the Corporate Governance section of this report. As required per this policy, TenneT also signed the Diversity Charter in 
2021 and embraces the principles of the Tax Governance Code.
We have used the Integrated Reporting (IR) framework, as defined by the International Integrating Reporting Council (IIRC)  
as a basis for this integrated report. This allows us to be transparent about our impact as an organisation. The financial 
information in this report was prepared in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the EU, and complies with Part 9 of Book 2 
of the Dutch Civil Code. 
Furthermore, our Integrated Annual Report complies with the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), which was 
translated to Dutch legislation and has been mandatory for annual reports since 2017. In 2022, the successor of this 
legislation was published: the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). Preparations to comply to this new EU 
legislation started in 2021, ahead of the final wording of the legislation and delivery of the reporting standards connected to 
them, the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). As a company already needing to comply to the NFRD, 
TenneT needs to report in accordance with the CSRD as of reporting year 2024. 
This report is also part of our progress and how we implement the 10 principles of the United Nations Global Compact 
(UNGC). We have endorsed these principles since 2015, not just to underline our own commitment, but also to drive CSR 
performance in the value chain. The UNGC principles are the basis of our TenneT Supplier Code of Conduct and mandatory 
for all suppliers. New suppliers who do not meet our standards during supplier visits, are disqualified from our tender 
procedures. The way communication on the progress related to the UNGC has changed in 2022 and as of 2023 this will be 
shared via the UNGC website.
In 2015, the United Nations launched the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These goals are accepted worldwide as 
driving sustainability. The section in our Integrated Annual Report 'The UN Sustainable Development Goals and TenneT' 
describes our impact and the contribution we make to the SDGs that are most relevant to our business.

Stakeholders and materiality
In accordance with the applied reporting principles, this integrated report covers topics considered material to our 
organisation. TenneT uses the materiality principle to determine which subjects/impacts to include in the report related to 
which activities (also with respect to our supply chain) to take into account. Our corporate website (www.tennet.eu) includes 
additional information which was not considered material for integrated reporting purposes. How we defined the material 
topics and the results of this assessment can be found in the materiality section below. The fact that we report on selected 
topics does not mean we do not manage aspects that are not considered material to our business. Our activities and CSR 
policy are broader and are not limited to the outcome of the materiality analysis. For more detailed information, go to the 
CSR section of our website.
In 2022, we updated our materiality analysis. Our policy is to perform this analysis every two to three years and review the 
analysis every year to identify gaps in intermediate years. This year, we applied the updated materiality assessment guidance 
provided by GRI in their Universal Standards (2021), described in GRI 3. Here, the analysis of the significance of TenneT’s 
economic, social and environmental impact was performed and determined through an internal analysis. We included the 
views of our (external) stakeholders from earlier surveys and interactions in this analysis. This determined whether our impact 
per topic is either high, medium or low. The outcome of this analysis was reviewed and validated by our highest governance 
body, being both the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. The outcome of this was that the following four impacts 
are considered to be our key material topics: safety, securing supply today and tomorrow, driving the energy transition and 
financial health. The materiality process is thoroughly embedded in the TenneT organisation. After validation, the materiality 
analysis was completed and resulted in the following overview.

As aforementioned, the European Commission adopted a proposal for the CSRD, which will replace the NFRD. With respect 
to materiality, the concept of double materiality is mentioned in both the NFRD as well as the CSRD, meaning that 
companies have to report about how sustainability issues affect their business and about their own impact on people and 
the environment. TenneT's impact on these dimensions is disclosed in Integrated Annual Report 2022 in several ways. This 
is a part of the materiality analysis where the significance of TenneT's impact is assessed per relevant topic. Key impacts are 
also disclosed quantitatively and qualitatively in the relevant chapters. With regards to our impact on people, this is disclosed 
in 'Our stakeholders' and the chapter 'Safe and inspiring workplace'. Our impact on the environment is disclosed in the 
chapter 'Create value to transition to a climate-neutral economy'.
The impact of sustainability topics on TenneT is described in the way we incorporate the Taskforce for Climate related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations in Integrated Annual Report 2022. The impact of climate change on our 
activities and the associated risks and opportunities are disclosed on pages 107-111. We also disclose how developments 
related to people and the environment could impact us as a company, for example in 'Key Developments' and the 'What 
could prevent us from reaching our goals?' in each chapter. This relates to the effects of climate change, scarcity of goods 
and services, changing demographics, also related to our people and future employees, might impact us, as for instance 
changing demographics and scarcity of (technical) talent provides challenges.
Scope and boundaries 
The table on the next pages provides a clear overview of the material topics, their impact, our contribution and the 
boundaries. A detailed disclosure of our management approach on each material topic can be found in the CSR section of 
our website.

leader in the energy 
transition, develop 
innovative instruments 
to unlock flexibility and 
establish a pivotal role 
in the energy data 
world to facilitate 
innovation.

For most of our figures, our reporting focus is on our own operations, although we do take some aspects of the value chain 
into account in our carbon footprint and safety (TRIR). We recognise that reporting outside our gate (so-called ‘value chain 
reporting’) provides a better overview of our impact. We will strive to expand the boundaries of our reporting where possible 
in the next years.

Data collection process
The reported data is obtained from financial and non-financial data management systems in our own operations, such as IFS 
and SAP for financial and HR data, Mecoms for our electricity transport data, and Zenya for our incident reporting, i.e. safety 
data. The key non-financial qualitative and quantitative data is included in the regular planning and control cycles and 
reported internally at least once a quarter by the Business Guidance department which performs a check on the quality and 
reliability of the data. TenneT’s Executive Board and senior management contribute to the context of the report and the 
quantitative data.

The definitions and calculations used are disclosed in the abbreviations and definitions section of this Integrated Annual 
Report and in the CSR section of our corporate website. The definitions and calculations used were re-assessed based on 
such things as process improvements, further alignment within the group and the materiality analysis. As a result, certain 
originally reported comparative figures were re-classified to conform to the current year’s presentation. 
The data for this report was measured, and where no data was available, it was estimated. An example of this is the energy 
use at some of our smaller offices. Due to the nature and maturity level of non-financial data, we acknowledge that it is a 
journey to fully align this with the level of financial systems and processes. Therefore, improvements can be made over time 
with the aim to provide our stakeholders better and more relevant information. That is why 100% completeness and 
accuracy of our data cannot be guaranteed as processes may be subject to a higher degree of manual data collection. 
External assurance
The financial statements included in this report are subject to an independent external audit and TenneT’s non-financial 
reporting is subject to a limited assurance review. These were both conducted by our external auditor, Deloitte Accountants 
B.V.. Reliable data is essential in our dialogue with stakeholders, so we decided to have our non-financial data reviewed by 
an external assurance provider. We have requested Deloitte to review the Integrated Annual Report sections ‘At a Glance’, 
‘Letter from the Board’, ‘About TenneT’ and ‘Our Performance in 2022’ (excluding ‘Safeguard sustainable financial 
performance and investor ratings’ and ‘Statements of the Executive Board’) with reference to the GRI Standards and audit 
the financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
Governance of CSR 
For TenneT, CSR covers a broad range of subjects, all aimed at creating a sustainable future for our internal and external 
stakeholders. CSR is embedded in our current strategy. We have set clear priorities, targets and key performance indicators 
in this. For some areas we are currently developing new or updating key performance indicators. On an overall level, our 
Executive Board is responsible for our strategy and company target setting, which includes the areas with respect to CSR. 
Our Strategy and Partnerships department, is mandated by the Executive Board to make decisions based on the CSR areas 
in our overall strategy and to execute studies for future ambitions with respect to CSR. In case new decisions and directions, 
this will be approved by the relevant decision committee within our organisation depending on the topic (Future Design, 
Asset, Integrated Work Planning or Systems & Market committee). In addition, business units are responsible for the topics 
that relate to their unit and sustainable development. The senior leaders are requested to manage and steer on their 
respective responsibility areas. 
These units report the progress with respect to our strategy, our financial and non-financial performance (including our CSR 
policy and actions) on a quarterly basis and this is reviewed by our Executive Board and Supervisory Board in that frequency 
to evaluate whether we are on track and or if actions are deemed necessary to improve. Our Supervisory Board consists of 
members all with knowledge of various elements of sustainable development. For more information, refer to page 90 of the 
Supervisory Board report where the capabilities matrix is included.

Introduction
The EU Taxonomy constitutes one of the cornerstones for both the European Green Deal as well as the EU Action Plan on 
Sustainable Finance. It aims to facilitate the flow of capital towards more sustainable investments in the EU. However, to do 
so, a clear definition of what constitutes as “sustainable” is needed. And this is what the EU Taxonomy is aimed at – 
providing clear guidance on when an activity can be deemed sustainable. Further reference is made to page 70 of this 
report.
Reporting requirements
TenneT, subject to the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) via Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, is required to 
apply the EU Taxonomy Regulation in its corporate reporting as of reporting year 2021.
As of this year, and in accordance with these requirements, TenneT reported on its eligible contribution to the European 
Union’s environmental objectives of climate change mitigation (CCM) according to the guidelines laid down in the EU 
Taxonomy.
We reported the share of turnover, capital expenditure (Capex) and operating expenditure (Opex) that we have deemed 
‘Taxonomy-eligible’ - irrespective of whether these activities met any or all the technical screening criteria stated in the 
Taxonomy.
For reporting year 2022, as per the current requirements, TenneT has also assessed whether its activities are taxonomy 
‘eligible’ and ‘aligned’. This builds on the 2021 ‘EU Taxonomy eligibility’ by requiring the activities to meet additional criteria 
for:
• Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation;
• Do no significant harm (DNSH) to any other environmental objectives for those activities; and
• Minimum safeguards at the organisational level.
To this end, we have analysed whether we meet these criteria (refer to page 70). Furthermore, we have comprehensively 
analysed and screened our eligible economic activities and the turnover they generate, as well as our Capex and Opex, and 
determined the share that qualifies as Taxonomy-aligned.
Basis for preparation
As indicated in Annex I to the Commission Delegated Regulation, article 1.2, the basis of how the KPIs are prepared, is 
included in our Integrated Annual Report 2022. This relates to the accounting policy (1.2.1), where is explained how these 
KPIs were determined and how the allocation has been performed. As nearly all of our activities are related to EU Taxonomy 
4.9 ‘Transmission and distribution of electricity’, allocation to different economic activities is not applicable. This is because 
our primary tasks are to provide electricity transmission services and system services and to facilitate the energy market. 
Those economic activities are linked to NACE code D35.12 and are concluded to substantially contribute to climate change 
mitigation, since TenneT is transmitting and distributing renewable energy in line with Directive (EU) 2018/2001, including 
necessary reinforcement or extension of the grid. In line with technical screening criterium 4.9 ’Transmission and distribution 
of electricity’ on climate mitigation, as per Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 of 4 June 2021 Annex I.  
The regulated activities are as such EU Taxonomy eligible activities (in the table known as activity A) and the non-regulated 
activities are EU Taxonomy non-eligible activities (in the table known as activity B).
Both turnover and operational expenditures are based on underlying financial information as disclosed in note 2 ‘Segment 
information’ of the consolidated financial statements and as used in the director’s report. Capital expenditures are also based 
on underlying financial information, but there are no differences with investments based on IFRS.
There were no changes to the application of calculations compared to the previous reporting period, nor material changes to 
the implementation of the Capex plans. Please further note that the nature of the Taxonomy eligible and Taxonomy aligned 
economic activities have been described on page 70 of this report and how compliance was assessed in related to the 
technical screening criteria (article 1.2.2). We consider Annex 1, articles 1.2.2.1c, 1.2.2.2., 1.2.2.3 and 1.2.3 to be not 
applicable to our situation, with the exception of the key information about our Capex plans related to our Taxonomy eligible

and aligned activities. Please note that we deem the risk of double counting not applicable our our eligible economic 
acticvities only relates to one activity (the aforementioned NACE code D35.12). More information on our investments, can be 
found in the chapter ‘Ensure critical infrastructure for society’ of the director’s report. These investments contribute to a 
future green energy system, related to the EU’s environmental goal of climate change mitigation. Significant research and 
development and innovation activities are mentioned in the ‘Our performance in 2022’ section of this report.
Our additional disclosures are therefore related to how these KPIs were determined and how the allocation has been 
performed.
Scope of sustainability reporting
For sustainability reporting purposes, TenneT consolidates data in line with the scope of our report as set out on page 199 
‘About this report’. The EU Taxonomy includes reporting of entities that are consolidated in the Group’s consolidated financial 
statements, in line with the requirements of IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’. As such the EU Taxonomy reporting 
scope is limited to our subsidiaries. Joint ventures and associates are not included for EU Taxonomy purposes as no 
turnover, Opex and Capex are recognised in the consolidated financial statements, because of accounting under the equity 
method for these types of investments.
Operational expenditures
Based on the frequently asked questions from October 2022 (Commission Notice on the interpretation of the Disclosures 
Delegated Act from October 2022) and December 2022 (Second Draft Commission Notice on interpretation and 
implementation EU Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act from December 2022), the Opex category is closely related to 
maintenance and repair and can include the following costs for: maintenance material, cost of employee repairing a machine, 
cost of employee cleaning a factory, IT dedicated to maintenance. In view of the above, TenneT has included grid related 
expenses in calculating the Opex. This methodology has not been updated compared to our Integrated Annual Report 2021.

EU Taxonomy Turnover (page 207)
Turnover for taxonomy-eligible activities (A. Taxonomy - eligible activities)
All regulated revenues are eligible to the EU Taxonomy turnover.
Determination of numerator for taxonomy – aligned turnover
All regulated revenues are aligned to EU Taxonomy, except the other revenues stream and the total share of the direct 
connections between our substation or grid and the network and a power production plant that is more greenhouse gas 
intensive than 100 gCO2e/kWh measured on a life cycle basis. This turnover is excluded from the final calculation to 
determine the reporting metrics related to this regulation and this turnover is disclosed under A.2. Taxonomy-eligible but not 
environmentally sustainable activities.
Determination of denominator for taxonomy-aligned turnover
Total turnover as included in note 2 ‘Segmenting information’.
EU Taxonomy Capex (page 208)
Capex for taxonomy-eligible activities (A. Taxonomy - eligible activities)
All regulated investments are eligible to the EU Taxonomy Capex. 
Determination of numerator for taxonomy - aligned activities
All investments are related to new connections to green electricity producers or other parts of the grid that are needed to 
transmit green electricity. The amount is based on the regulated investments and additions to the right-of-use assets, 
reference is made to the table below.
Determination of denominator for taxonomy - aligned activities
Total of the investments and the right-of-use assets additions, reference is made to the next table.
