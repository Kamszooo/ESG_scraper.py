Letter from the CEO 
Dear reader,
As we launch our latest Sustainability Report, I would 
like to extend my deepest gratitude for TeamNexperia's 
unwavering dedication and hard work throughout 2023. 
Your continual strive for excellence was instrumental in 
driving our progress during an economically challenging 
year. 
Our inaugural Sustainability Report in 2022 marked 
a significant milestone in Nexperia's commitment 
to transparency and accountability. It served as a 
catalyst for increased awareness and action within our 
organization and holding ourselves to a higher standard 
of responsibility. I'm particularly encouraged by the 
positive response to our efforts, which is a testament 
to the value our stakeholders place on our sustainability 
initiatives. Your enthusiasm for driving the transition 
to green energy and a more equitable future is truly 
inspiring. 
Throughout 2023, we achieved some remarkable 
milestones in technological innovation and product 
development. From the successful qualification of our 
first IGBT devices to the widespread mass production of 
GaN and SiC products, we have consistently reinforced 
our commitment to moving technology forward. 
Despite last year’s global and economic challenges, 
including high energy prices leading to a rise in 
production costs, our team remained resilient, flexible, 
and engaged. We navigated these difficulties with 
enthusiasm and creativity, finding intelligent solutions 
to mitigate the impacts on our sustainability goals. 
Our ability to weather these storms while maintaining 
our focus on sustainability speaks volumes about the 
dedication and ingenuity of our team.  
Looking ahead, we remain steadfast in our resolve to 
continue overcoming obstacles and making meaningful 
contributions to a greener, more sustainable world. As 
Nexperia’s CEO, I am proud of our progress in reducing 
our carbon footprint (underscored by our pledge to 
become carbon neutral for Scope 1 and 2 emissions 
by 2035), our first ESG Risk Rating with Morningstar 
Sustainalytics achieving a low-risk score of 18.7, fostering 
diversity and inclusion in the workplace, and promoting 
ethical business practices internally and across our 
supply chain. At the same time, there are always new 
challenges on the horizon and additional ways we can 
improve. That is why we continuously review and refine 
our sustainability approach, ensuring we evolve with the 
ever-changing economic landscape. 
I am confident that our commitment to sustainability 
and responsible operations will continue driving positive 
change. I invite you to explore our latest Sustainability 
Report, which embodies our dedication to transparency 
and accountability. 
Once again, thank you for your continued support as we 
strive to build a more sustainable and equitable future.
Sincerely, 
Xuezheng (Wing) Zhang

Nexperia operates in a highly cyclical 
industry, which is very susceptible 
to fluctuations in demand driven by 
changes in technological advancements, 
economic conditions, and consumer 
preferences. Efficiency is at the heart 
of everything we do and is backed 
by flawless execution that meets the 
stringent requirements of the market 
and our customers. Despite the 
challenges of an economically turbulent 
2023, characterized by high energy costs 
and fluctuating demand, we maintained

The manufacturing of semiconductors is 
a highly specialized production process 
with multiple sub-processes, which require 
various raw materials. The most critical 
raw materials are raw silicon wafers. These 
high-quality wafers are procured from a 
select few suppliers with whom we maintain 
strong relationships. We continuously 
evaluate these partnerships to ensure 
mutual satisfaction.
Where feasible, the Company aims for 
efficient, just-in-time delivery to better 
manage procurement cost and cash flows 
while mitigating the risk of low inventory 
levels. Whenever possible, purchase 
contracts are based on fixed prices and 
medium-term obligations to buffer against 
the price volatility of raw materials.
Manufacturing
Our manufacturing is overseen by 
the central Technology & Operations 
organization, ensuring efficient and 
sustainable production. Technology & 
Operations achieves scale benefits through 
optimized asset utilization, purchasing 
volumes, and overhead leveraging across 
different business units.  
The manufacturing process for 
semiconductors is divided into “front-end” 
and “back-end.” The front-end involves 
the actual production and fabrication of 
semiconductors in our manufacturing 
facilities (“fabs”). The back-end encompasses 
assembly, configuration, testing, and 
packaging. 
At our front-end facilities, Nexperia 
produces semiconductors with various 
sizes and characteristics to meet our 
customers’ dynamic demands. The back-end 
manufacturing facilities test and package 
many different types of products using a 
wide variety of assembly processes.

Research and 
development, patents, 
and licenses
As an advanced manufacturer in an 
ever-evolving industry, research and 
development (R&D) is the foundation 
of our long-term success. Therefore, 
our robust and effective research 
and development approach focuses 
on existing as well as untapped and 
unknown markets. Following its 
strategy, we are significantly expanding 
our research and development 
capabilities and will continue investing in 
the future.
Our global research and development 
team continues to grow and comprises 
1,122 highly skilled employees 
(compared to 2022: 999). Our research 
and development expenses totaled 
$106 million in 2023 (2022: $81 million) 
or 6.8% of our total revenue (2022: 
4.5%).  
Intellectual property
Creating and using our intellectual 
property (IP) enables us to sustain 
and extend our market presence 
while exploring new growth 
opportunities. The value of our 
IP portfolio enables Nexperia’s 
freedom to operate and minimizes 
the potential financial burden of, for 
example, licensing royalties. Our IP 
portfolio encompasses various patents, 
trademarks, and other assets, none 
of which are individually critical to 
our operations. We are committed to 
protecting our IP by obtaining patents, 
trademarks, and domain names, 
retaining trade secrets, and defending, 
enforcing, and utilizing intellectual 
property rights and confidentiality 
agreements where applicable. 
Our trademarks in particular are 
essential for product differentiation, 
fostering trust and loyalty among our 
customers, suppliers, partners, and end-
users.

NEXPERIA AT A GLANCEnexperia | Sustainability Report 2023
10Our Company and Business

Page 11:
Our product development complies with current 
environmental legislation and guidelines relating 
to our products and their materials, such as the 
Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS).
We organize our research and development 
(R&D) to comply with the following standards and 
requirements:
› ISO 9001: Quality management systems.
› IATF 16949: Quality management system 
requirements for automotive production and 
relevant service parts organizations.
› ISO 14001: Environmental management systems.
Since its inception, Nexperia has been successfully 
audited by specialised external auditors against these 
standards (ISO, IATF). Our ongoing compliance is 
partly due to incorporating ISO 14001 product design 
requirements into our standard working procedure, 
our Eco Design Policy. 
Our product creation process adheres to our Business 
Creation and Management Process, ensuring 
compliance with the above standards. Cross-functional 
project teams meticulously plan, manage, and execute 
all R&D projects, compliant with these standards and 
guided by our established processes and checklists. 
The responsibility of implementing this process within 
each business group rests with the respective R&D 
managers, while the business group management 
team bears overall accountability.
New Product Design
As Nexperia’s products are ubiquitous, every 
innovation and enhancement also improves 
the energy efficiency of the final product. 
Innovations in our semiconductors, for 
example, can extend the range of electric 
vehicles or reduce the size of phone chargers, 
reducing both shipping and material costs. Our 
portfolio is under constant refinement to boost 
energy efficiency. Additionally, Nexperia's 
portfolio includes products with increased 
power capabilities, such as wide bandgap 
(WBG) devices like silicon carbide (SiC) rectifiers 
or gallium nitride (GaN) FETs, as well as power 
management integrated circuits (ICs). 
Today, most widely used power electronics 
are silicon-based, but a growing number 
require high current and voltage switching. 
This demand necessitates wide band gap 
semiconductors and new materials such as SiC 
or GaN, as these advanced materials are pivotal 
in increasing the energy efficiency of products 
and applications. Therefore, these materials 
are considered essential for the global energy 
transition. 
As an industry leader, Nexperia is dedicated 
to the ongoing development of products that 
lower energy and material use across a wide 
array of applications. We are equally committed 
to achieving CO2 neutrality in our operations, 
furthering our contribution to a sustainable 
future.

Our Approach to ESG
Generating long-term stakeholder value and 
managing risks and opportunities
As described in our company mission 
statement, Nexperia is driven by a strong 
commitment to innovation, efficiency, 
and sustainability. Our forward-looking 
approach includes taking a holistic view of 
our organization’s impact on society and the 
environment while continually identifying 
new risks and opportunities. As a member 
of various communities worldwide (see a 
list of our key stakeholders below), we aim 
to enrich the lives of our employees, their 
families, and people throughout our value 
chain while minimizing or avoiding negative 
impacts on people and the environment. 
At the same time, we aim to manage social 
and environmental risks and opportunities 
that may impact Nexperia (see our risk 
management approach in the “Financial 
Reporting” chapter of this report). 
We combine robust internal policies and 
controls that focus on the impact of our 
entire value chain and the life cycle of 
our products. To evaluate and manage 
our impacts, risks, and opportunities, we 
consider different environmental, social, 
and governance (ESG) topics; Nexperia's 
Sustainability Report is structured according 
to these topics.
As an international manufacturer, we also 
acknowledge our stakeholders’ increasing 
interest in and demands to intensify our ESG 
efforts. In response, we are working to more 
thoroughly integrate ESG into our business 
and leverage our innovative and energy-
efficient technologies to contribute to a 
more sustainable world.
Our strategy
Our sustainability strategy is based on the 
materiality assessment we conducted in 2022 and 
our prioritization of material topics in 2022 and 
2023. We developed concrete goals encompassing 
the most relevant ESG topics, with a focus on the 
following sustainability performance targets: 
› Environment: We are committed to achieving 
carbon neutrality for our Scope 1 and 2 emissions 
by 2035, based on yearly reduction targets. 
› Social: We are working toward increasing the 
share of women in management positions to 
30% and women in R&D and engineering to 
20% by 2030. Our targets reflect a material 
issue across the entire semiconductor Industry. 
In response, we launched our D&I program and 
rolled out numerous female empowerment 
initiatives in 2023.
We acknowledge that our sustainability journey 
is an ongoing process, and achieving long-term 
ESG targets requires continually improving our 
knowledge, systems, and actions. In 2024, we will 
continue developing our group-wide sustainability 
strategy based on our new materiality assessment. 
This assessment, further described in the 
“Materiality Assessment” chapter, will also provide 
the basis for Nexperia’s Sustainability Reports 
in compliance with the European Corporate 
Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).

Another critical area of our ESG focus is our 
carbon footprint. We officially launched our 
greenhouse gas (GHG) Emissions Reduction 
Roadmap in 2023 and formally committed 
to becoming carbon neutral for Scope 1 and 
2 emissions by 2035. To reach this target, we 
are constantly working to reduce our energy 
consumption and GHG emissions while 
increasing our use of renewable electricity.
Our existing ESG management approaches 
and upcoming ESG strategy are equal 
aspects of our business strategy. 
Of the five pillars of Nexperia’s 2023 
business mission and the global megatrends 
affecting our company, “Sustainability & 
Energy Efficiency” and “Electrification” 
have clear connections to a sustainable 
future. There is a growing need for power 
and connectivity, an accelerating switch 
to electric vehicles (including a three-fold 
increase in the number of semiconductors 
required), and an urgent need for 
sustainability and a global energy transition. 
We believe Nexperia can play a vital role in 
these areas, which we strategically consider 
as our five megatrend applications. We also 
improve our customers’ energy efficiency by 
providing innovative semiconductor devices, 
such as silicon carbide and gallium nitride.

As a signatory to the Global Compact, we 
follow its ten core principles in everything 
we do. They lay the foundations of 
responsible business activities in the areas 
of human rights, labor, the environment, 
and anti-corruption. By following these 
principles, we continuously improve these 
aspects of our work. 
We also embrace opportunities to inspire 
people and shape the future while 
positioning ourselves for sustainable 
success. For example, at the start of 2023, 
we launched our Nexperia Diversity & 
Inclusion (D&I) program to respect and 
celebrate our employees’ unique talents, 
cultures, and backgrounds. In 2023, we 
also commenced an annual global Code of 
Conduct training program that is mandatory 
for all employees. The training centers on 
our standards for professional behavior, 
both internally and when interacting with 
customers and partners. In this edition, 
we extended the scope of the training to 
broaden our employees’ understanding of 
D&I and social standards.

In 2023, Nexperia further developed its 
sustainability organization and created 
a new structure for its sustainable 
corporate governance. It comprises 
three main elements, including a defined 
sustainability board launched at the 
beginning of 2024.
Corporate Sustainability Office 
The Corporate Sustainability Office is a 
new team at Nexperia led by the Head 
of Sustainability. In 2023, this function 
reported to the Head of Quality and 
was subordinate to the Chief Operating 
Officer (COO) and the Chief Executive 
Officer (CEO). From May 2024, the 
Head of Sustainability directly reports 
to the Chief Operating Officer (COO). 
As the central sustainability team, 
the Corporate Sustainability Office is 
primarily responsible for creating the 
sustainability strategy and roadmap, 
defining and driving work streams, 
ensuring sustainability reporting and 
ESG rating results, and representing 
Nexperia externally. In 2024, the 
growing Corporate Sustainability 
Office team will also be responsible 
for social sustainability issues, such as 
human rights, stakeholder engagement, 
and sustainability-related customer 
requirements that support Nexperia's 
sustainability journey.
Sustainable corporate governance structure
Before we introduced the new 
governance structure at the end of 
2023, Nexperia’s ESG project, which is 
now part of the Sustainability Office, 
was supervised by a steering board 
comprising our Chief Financial Officer 
(CFO), Chief Operating Officer (COO), 
Senior Director of Environment, Health, 
and Safety and Corporate Social 
Responsibility (EHS and CSR), Head of 
Quality, and Senior Director of Advocacy 
and Alliances. The steering board 
met monthly to track the progress of 
various initiatives in the ESG project, 
including preparing Nexperia’s first 
Sustainability Report in accordance with 
GRI standards, implementing software 
solutions for non-financial reporting, 
and our ESG risk rating with Morningstar 
Sustainalytics. In subsequent steps, 
the CFO or COO presented executive 
summaries of the ESG project or decision 
topics to the Executive Management 
Team (EMT).

Board. The Head of Sustainability hosts a 
monthly meeting to assess and manage 
Nexperia's sustainability performance, 
address any shortfalls, and drive 
meaningful progress.
Key insights from these Sustainability

a uniform approach, every employee must 
read and comply with our Code of Conduct, 
supported by yearly training sessions tracked 
in our e-learning system. Our Code of Conduct 
also applies to temporary employees and 
workers in our supply chain. In 2023, we rolled 
out a new global Code of Conduct campaign, 
supported by a statement from our CEO and 
bespoke posters for display at all Nexperia sites 
worldwide.
For our suppliers, we enhance our Code of 
Conduct with a Supplier Code of Conduct. This 
document provides the framework to help our 
partners and suppliers mirror our commitments 
to sustainability and social responsibility. It 
is based on our Code of Conduct and the 
principles of the Code of Conduct of the 
Responsible Business Alliance (RBA). It ensures 
the working conditions in our supply chains 
are safe and within the regulatory borders 
of the countries where they operate. By 
signing a “Supplier Statement of Conformity,” 
our suppliers commit to treating workers 
with respect and dignity and maintaining 
minimum standards of environmentally 
responsible manufacturing. We founded 
these commitments using globally recognized 
standards, such as the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights, the ILO Labor Standards, 
the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), and core 
labor norms. More information on this topic 
can be found in the “Responsible Sourcing and 
Supplier Engagement” chapter of this report.
ESG policies
Concrete policies and guidelines are the 
foundation of effective sustainability and 
ESG management. Many of our policies 
have specific application scopes within our 
material ESG topics, which are described in the 
corresponding chapters. Some other policies 
also guide our daily sustainability initiatives on a 
broader level.
Our Sustainability Policy supports the Code of 
Conduct for environmental, health, and safety 
topics. It also provides a general overview of 
our approach to important ESG topics, with 
clear commitments to ethics, labor and human 
rights, employees, products, operations, 
compliance, local initiatives, transparency, and 
stakeholder dialogue. The policy classifies these 
topics and commitments, making it simple for 
everyone at Nexperia to understand our values 
and goals.
Our Code of Conduct is a vital document that 
clearly defines how we want to work with 
each other and achieve our collective goals as 
a company. It includes decision trees, ethical 
guidance, the SpeakUp Line, and our guarantee 
of no reprisals. It also outlines the general 
ethical standards we apply to our employment, 
business, and personal integrity, as well as our 
company assets and external activities that 
may impact people or the environment. All 
employees can raise questions or concerns 
via the different reporting lines described in 
chapter two of our Code of Conduct. To ensure 
To further underpin our commitment to human 
rights, we published our new Policy Statement 
on human rights and environment-related due 
diligence obligations in Q1 2024. This policy 
explains that Nexperia - as a global company with 
approximately 14,000 employees representing 
diverse cultures and nations - is firmly committed 
to upholding human rights. The policy describes 
our risk analysis, preventive and remedial 
measures, and complaint mechanism.

Stakeholder engagement
We recognize that Nexperia is part of a diverse 
ecosystem, and our success depends on 
the responsible relationships we build with 
our stakeholders. Therefore, as part of our 
commitment to sustainability, we engage 
with our stakeholders to ensure transparency, 
understand their expectations, concerns, and 
perspectives, and collaborate with them to 
develop and implement sustainable solutions.
Engaging with our stakeholders creates shared 
value and promotes sustainable development. 
Effective stakeholder engagement is vital to 
building trust, managing risks, and driving 
long-term business success. Our stakeholders’ 
voices are critical to shaping our sustainability 
strategy and ensuring we remain accountable 
to the communities and environments where 
we operate. 
To ensure we engage with the right 
stakeholders in the right way, we undertook 
a comprehensive stakeholder identification 
and assessment process in 2022. We will refine 
these insights in our next materiality analysis, 
planned for 2024 (described in the “Materiality 
Assessment” chapter). Our assessment included 
both internal and external stakeholder groups.
We engage with our stakeholders regularly, 
using various methods and channels to ensure 
we capture a diverse range of perspectives. 
Throughout the year, we communicate with our 
partners, customers, and internal and external 
stakeholders on sustainability-related topics, 
trends, and developments relevant to our 
industry. Our engagement process is designed 
to be inclusive, transparent, and responsive 
to stakeholder input and feedback. We aim 
to achieve dynamic, two-way communication 
that enables us to create sustainable solutions 
together.
An essential aspect of our engagement 
strategy is contributing to various initiatives 
and associations, such as signing the UN Global 
Compact in January 2023. As an international 
company, Nexperia is also a member of several 
other national and global industry associations 
and is regarded as a think tank of relevance in 
the semiconductor industry.

such as town halls, social media, newsletters, and our website, and 
structural engagements with policymakers, industry associations,

approach by incorporating stakeholder feedback and learning from 
best practices in the field.

Materiality Assessment

Standards: 
Our approach to defining 
materiality
A robust materiality assessment is a 
fundamental aspect of corporate sustainability 
management. We conducted our initial 
materiality assessment in the second half 
of 2022. Following the approach of double 
materiality, we identified material sustainability 
topics based on their impact on people and 
the environment (impact materiality) and/or 
on financial concerns (financial materiality). In 
addition, our analysis allowed us to determine 
whether topics are strategically important and 
must be included in our Sustainability Report. 
Our materiality assessment was based on 
an analysis of various internal and external 
documents and an online stakeholder survey. 
Covering both impact and financial materiality, 
we consulted Nexperia’s stakeholders on 
the impact intensity and the probability of 
occurrence of sustainability topics. Nexperia’s 
Sustainability Report 2022 offers a detailed 
description of our materiality assessment 
process, including the identification of 
sustainability topics, involvement of 
stakeholders, validation, and results.

ESRS-compliant 
materiality
From January to April 2024, we 
conducted a new materiality assessment 
according to the European Sustainability 
Reporting Standards (ESRS). These 
standards outline the requirements 
for companies and organizations to 
transparently disclose sustainability 
information in alignment with the EU’s 
Corporate Sustainability Reporting 
Directive (CSRD). The results are 
expected by May 2024. In addition to 
focusing on the topic list defined in the 
ESRS, we considered our entire value 
chain and different timeframes. In line 
with the ESRS disclosure requirements, 
we also identified significant potential 
positive and negative impacts, risks, 
and opportunities. As in 2022, we 
engaged with stakeholders to assess 
the topics. We updated our value 
chain and stakeholder mapping and 
opted for a qualitative approach in 
our corresponding analysis, consulting 
selected representatives of our 
stakeholder groups in one-on-one 
interviews. 
“Our double materiality analysis 
in preparation for the CSRD was 
guided by two main goals: complying 
with the CSRD requirements and 
pinpointing the environmental, 
social, and governmental issues 
crucial to both our company and our 
stakeholders.”

Sustainability-Linked Loan
Nexperia’s leading industry position 
regarding ESG factors and its 
commitment to environmental and 
social ambitions was reaffirmed in 2023. 
In December 2023, Nexperia successfully 
signed an $800 million Senior 
Sustainability-Linked Loan (SLL) (for 
further details, see our Annual Report).
The SLL includes environmental and 
social Key Performance Indicators 
(KPIs). This method incentivizes 
environmentally and socially sustainable 
economic growth and innovation. The 
SLL’s KPIs primarily relate to greenhouse 
gas emissions and gender diversity, with 
a focus on including more women in 
management positions. With these KPIs, 
the SLL directly reflects our strategy and 
target of achieving carbon neutrality by 
2035 for Scope 1 and 2 emissions and 
reaching 30% women in management 
positions by 2030. 
For additional transparency and robust

from underutilization of the factories. Gross 
profit was significantly weaker than expected 
($-283 million), which was also driven by lower 
volumes and the underloading effect.

Risk Management 
Risk management and internal 
controls form an integral part of 
business management. Nexperia’s Risk 
Management Policy and principles help its 
management team proactively monitor 
the Group’s day-to-day operations, achieve 
strategic goals, ensure compliance with 
all legal requirements, safeguard the 
Company’s assets, and maintain integrity 
in its financial reporting and related 
disclosures. 
Management holds overall accountability 
and responsibility for managing risk 
to the organization and implementing 
appropriate risk response measures 
focusing on material risks. By considering 
all reasonable possibilities, management 
identifies opportunities for the Company 
and unique challenges associated with 
current and future opportunities.
Risks, opportunities (as part of the 
planning process), and internal controls 
are regularly assessed, evaluated, 
actively managed, and reported to senior 
management. 
Risks and opportunities are classified as 
follows:
› Strategic 
› Operational
› Financial 
› Compliance
› ESG
Nexperia has designed its internal Control 
and Risk Management System based on 
the criteria and principles established in 
international best practice standards, such 
as the COSO Model and C-SOX-Standards. 
Risks and opportunities are listed in 
a register maintained by the Risk and 
Internal Control Office.
To understand the impacts associated 
with an identified risk or opportunity and 
its characteristics, the following factors 
are reviewed:
› Potential impact
› Probability of occurrence
› Time-related factors

Assessment
The risk assessment is also affected by 
any divergence or deviation of risk, biases, 
professional judgments, and quality of 
the used information. Therefore, it should 
be noted that any risk management and 
internal control system, regardless of 
how well it is designed and operated, can 
provide only reasonable, not absolute, 
assurance that its objectives will be met.
Potential financial losses or gains 
associated with an identified risk and 
opportunity are assessed as follows:
› High [$29 million]
› Medium [$7 – 29 million]
› Low [$7 million]
We calculate materiality based on the 
average PBT (profit before tax) using 
audited actuals and RFF (Rolling Financial 
Forecast) figures. The assessment of 
materiality is re-performed annually. 
The Company has insurance measures in 
place, the efforts of which are considered 
in the net risk analysis. The insurance 
program is reviewed on a regular basis.
Nexperia has implemented a digital 
system to manage risks within the 
organization. This system supports the 
efficient and effective identification, 
analysis, and monitoring of risks. Starting 
from Q1 2024, all risk management 
activities will be carried out using 
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
software. During the preparation of the 
response plan, the costs of actions taken 
to manage both risks and opportunities 
will be considered, wherever feasible.

Strategic Risks
Risk title Risk description Strategy to address the risk
Market risk - cyclical industry The semiconductor industry is regarded as highly cyclical. The demand is mostly driven 
by end products that are highly sensitive to an economic downturn. As a result of 
this the semiconductor market is highly sensitive to economic conditions. In strong 
economic conditions semiconductor companies cannot keep up with the demand 
for the products and then expand their manufacturing capacity. In periods of lower 
economic activity, these higher fixed costs and over stocking could result in lower 
gross profit.
Nexperia focuses on market analysis and product 
development to ensure that it is always well positioned to 
remain profitable even in economic downturns.
Nexperia is active in various markets and  not dependent on 
the economic conditions of a single market.
Nexperia’s products are versatile and can be used in various 
segments and by different customers. 
Market risk - price erosion As competition in the market continues to increase and technology continues to 
evolve, competitively pricing Nexperia’s products remain one of the most important 
parts of achieving a competitive advantage. Failure to achieve this will have a negative 
effect on the profitability of the Company.
In order to continue to profitably supply the Group’s products, 
Nexperia focuses on reducing the production cost in line with 
the competitors whilst at the same time keeping the Group’s 
focus on the quality of the produced products. Usually, this 
must be accomplished through improvements in process 
technology and production efficiencies.
Reputational risk Risks associated with negative publicity, product recalls, and other events that 
could damage the company's reputation. Nexperia’s reputation is a major driver of 
corporate goodwill. Damage of corporate reputation could have material impact on 
Nexperia’s brand value and financial position.
Nexperia set up a Corporate Affairs Department to closely 
monitor and measure its reputation and take risk response 
accordingly, e.g., an information and communication strategy 
is defined toward suppliers, customers, and other relevant 
stakeholders.
Technological changing 
industry
As the industry Nexperia operates in is changing at a rapid rate, the risk exists that 
Nexperia will fall behind in terms of its technological capabilities of its facilities 
and the results of its research and development. This requires significant capital 
investment. If Nexperia is unable to generate sufficient cash flows or raise sufficient 
capital on favorable terms, this could have a material adverse effect on the business, 
financial condition, and results of its operations.
To remain relevant, extensive and continuous research and 
development and capital investments are a focus point for 
Nexperia.

Risk title Risk description Strategy to address the risk
Geopolitical risks Geopolitical risks, including political instability, conflict, and economic sanctions, may 
indirectly impact the semiconductor industry as a whole. These impacts could result 
from worldwide trade sanctions and economic disruption followed by possible price 
increases in the supply chain.
For Nexperia, the impact of the ongoing Russian and Ukraine war (including possible 
non-compliance to sanctions regulations) has been rated as remote.
Nexperia created a dedicated team to closely monitor the 
geopolitical situation and ensure that the Group is compliant 
with any sanctions and fully understands any impact of 
sanctions on business continuity.
Nexperia reduced the risk exposure by investing in long-term 
agreements and partnerships, as well as in the ecosystem and 
near sourcing.
Operational Risks
Risk title Risk description Strategy to address risk
IT/OT risks including cyber 
risk
Nexperia relies heavily on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex 
information technology applications, systems, and networks to run the business. As a 
result of this, the reliability and security of the information technology infrastructure 
and its ability to expand and remain up to date is critical to the business. A significant 
breach or interruption of the information technology application can have a serious 
effect on Nexperia's operations. 
Through developed security strategy, regular self-review, 
penetration tests, and external input, Nexperia ensures that 
the maintenance and security of information technology 
systems are of the required quality to mitigate the risk 
mentioned.
Capacity expansion The market for semiconductors is a dynamic and cyclical market. This leads to rapid 
demand changes. If Nexperia does not effectively plan for the demand changes, over 
or under expansion can lead to financial losses and loss of market share.
Nexperia ensures that it mitigates this risk by having a long-
term planning process covering relevant market trends and 
regularly reviewing and adjusting these forecasts.
Nexperia has established an External Manufacturing 
department to promptly respond to the market needs and 
ensure capacity from external suppliers.

Risk title Risk description Strategy to address risk
Intellectual property rights Due to the nature of the industry, the quality and protection of the Company’s 
current intellectual property rights as well as the development of new and improved 
intellectual property rights are major success drivers of the Company. Failure to 
protect and develop these will result in operating losses and losses of competitive 
advantage.
Nexperia seeks various appropriate ways to protect its 
intellectual properties. Nexperia also understands the 
importance of developing new and improved intellectual 
property rights through investment in research and 
development.
Nexperia regularly reviews the existing patents, closely 
monitors market requirements, and works on innovations.
Production risks Nexperia manufactures in its own factories as well as with third parties. The 
manufacturing consists of processes that are highly complex, require advanced 
and costly equipment, and must continuously be modified to improve yields and 
performance. Difficulties in the production process can reduce yields or interrupt 
production, and, because of such problems, the Company may on occasion not be 
able to deliver products or do so in a timely or cost-effective or competitive manner. 
As the complexity of both the products and fabrication processes has become 
more advanced, manufacturing tolerances have been reduced and requirements 
for precision have become more demanding. As a result of the above, Nexperia has 
experienced manufacturing difficulties due to internal or external problems that 
have given rise to delays in delivery and quality control problems. There can be no 
assurance that any such occurrence in the future would not materially harm the 
Group’s results of operations.
Nexperia has established a business continuity management 
team to respond to potential production line interruptions, 
which includes business continuity plans that are regularly 
reviewed. Critical incidents are managed by a crisis 
management team, which is set up as required.

Procurement risks including 
supply chain risk
Nexperia is highly dependent on a few suppliers and the quality and timely delivery of 
raw materials. To effectively manage cash flows, the Company makes use of just-in-
time delivery of some of its raw materials. As some of the raw materials are highly 
specialized, Nexperia sources these of a small number of trusted suppliers. Because 
the raw materials that Nexperia purchases are complex, it is frequently difficult or 
impossible for the Company to substitute the materials with a similar product. The 
business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed 
if Nexperia is unable to obtain adequate supplies of quality raw materials in a timely 
manner.
Through previous business ventures, Nexperia’s management 
has long-standing relationships with all the big suppliers. 
Nexperia understands that it is dependent on some of its 
suppliers and will continue to build on these relationships and 
further improve the procurement and supplier selection (dual 
sourcing) process.
Nexperia assesses the risk for each supplier and ensures the 
dual sourcing of raw materials necessary for production.
Additionally, Nexperia is monitoring all relevant supplier risk 
management legislation according to relevant legislation and 
International Best Practices. 
International business risks 
including trade compliance 
risks
The international business environment that Nexperia participates in is subject to 
many economic and political uncertainties, including the following international 
business risks:
› Negative economic developments in economies around the world and the instability 
of governments and international trade agreements.
› Social and political instability in a number of countries around the world having a 
negative effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and operations.
› Potential terrorist attacks.
› Epidemics and pandemics, which may adversely affect the Group’s workforce and 
financial position.
› Adverse changes in governmental policies, especially those affecting trade and 
investment.
› Nexperia’s customers or other groups of stakeholders might impose; requirements 
that are more stringent than the laws in the countries in which the Group is active.
› Threats that the Group’s operations or property could be subject to nationalization 
and expropriation.
These international business risks are monitored and assessed 
by management on a continuous basis to ensure that these 
risks are managed and appropriately and proactively reacted 
to where needed. Furthermore, Nexperia has set up a Trade 
Compliance Organization and specific controls to cover 
trade compliance risks, e.g., export control; restricted party 
screening on business partners, customers, vendors, and 
hiring.

Risk title Risk description Strategy to address risk
Product quality risks Potential risk of product quality issues related to the product defects and safety can 
result in product recalls, warranty claims, and the failure to comply with the terms and 
conditions of our contracts. This can lead to financial losses and reputational damage.
Nexperia defined a Quality Policy in which various risk 
response measures are defined, which are regularly 
monitored and steered by Business Group Quality 
Management.
Financial Risks
Risk title Risk description Strategy to address the risk
Currency risk Nexperia is a global company and, as a direct consequence, movements in the financial 
markets may impact the financial results. This is further heightened by the fact that 
the Group’s reporting currency of the consolidated accounts differs from some of 
Nexperia’s entities’ local currencies. The impact of foreign currency translation of the 
financial statements of foreign operations in the consolidated accounts may have a 
negative effect on Nexperia’s shareholders’ equity.
Nexperia monitors its foreign currency risk on a regular basis 
and controls them through natural hedges, cash flow hedges 
and other hedging instruments.  Since a component of its 
outstanding debt is denominated in Renminbi, Nexperia 
managed and mitigated its currency risk by using various 
financial derivatives, such as entering into forward contracts.
Credit and interest rate risk Nexperia invests available cash and cash equivalents with various financial 
institutions across the world and is in that respect exposed to the credit risk of these 
counterparties. Nexperia is also geared in terms of long-term debt. An increase in 
interest rates will lead to higher financial expenses.
Nexperia seeks to actively manage concentration risk on a 
daily basis adhering to its stringent treasury management 
policy. Nexperia also limits the credit risk by only transacting 
with financial institutions with strong credit ratings.
To mitigate the fluctuation of interest cash flow, Nexperia 
entered into interest rate swap contracts where the variable 
interest rates are converted  into fixed interest rates.
Commodity price risk Nexperia is a purchaser of certain base metals, precious metals, chemicals, and energy 
used in the manufacturing process of its products. The prices of these raw materials 
can be volatile due to global demand trends. These fluctuations, when not planned for 
properly, can have a negative effect on the profits made by the Company.
Nexperia employs experienced individuals who are 
responsible for planning and purchasing these raw materials 
to ensure that this risk is appropriately managed.

Financial Risks
Risk title Risk description Strategy to address the risk
Market risk - inflation The global economy in which Nexperia conducts its business is vulnerable to 
unexpected fluctuations in inflationary expectations, political uncertainty, and 
negative interest rate policies. These occurrences will negatively affect the purchase 
power of the end users which will have a negative ripple effect on the demand for 
Nexperia’s products.
Nexperia understands the risks relating to this and addresses 
them through effective monitoring, forecasting, and 
continuous increases of efficiencies to drive manufacturing 
cost down whilst retaining the highest quality.
In addition, Nexperia increased prices toward customers to 
compensate any price increase on the procurement side.
Risks related to the goodwill 
and other intangible assets
Goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value on 
the acquisition date. Impairment of these may result from, among other things, 
deterioration in performance, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in 
applicable laws or regulations, including changes that restrict the activities of the 
Company or affect the products and services that the Company sells, challenges to the 
validity of certain registered intellectual property, reduced sales of certain products 
incorporating registered intellectual property, and a variety of other factors. The 
amount of any identified impairment must be expensed immediately as a charge to 
results of operations. Depending on future circumstances, it is thus possible that the 
Company may not be able to realize the full value of its intangible assets. Any future 
determination of impairment of goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets could 
have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, and 
shareholders’ equity.
At initial recognition, Nexperia takes the necessary steps to 
ensure that the goodwill and other identifiable intangible 
assets are measured at their fair value appropriately and 
not overstated. Furthermore, Nexperia reviews its goodwill 
and other intangible assets balances for impairment upon 
any indication of a potential impairment, and in the case of 
goodwill, at a minimum of once a year to ensure that any 
identified impairments are processed in a timely manner.
Ineffective internal controls Deficiencies in the internal control systems that govern the accuracy and reliability of 
the periodic reporting may lead to financial losses and reputational damage.
Nexperia has adopted effective policies and procedures 
to ensure that the internal control systems regarding the 
periodic reporting are in place and are regularly reviewed. 
Technically Nexperia’s internal control process is managed by 
means of SAP GRC Process and Access Control.

Nexperia’s indebtedness On December 31, 2023, Nexperia has an outstanding debt with a principal amount 
of $561 million (2022: $506 million). This indebtedness exposes the Company to 
risks that could adversely affect its financial condition. The risk drivers for the above-
mentioned risks are as follows:
› Increasing vulnerability due to adverse economic industry and competitive 
developments.
› Requiring a substantial portion of cash flow to service the capital and interest 
payments.  
› Reducing the ability to use the current cash flows to fund operations, capital 
expenditures, future business opportunities, and other strategic acquisitions.
› Heightened interest rate risk as the loan bears interest at a variable rate.
› Limiting the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing to fund its working 
capital, capital expenditures, restructuring, product development, research and 
development, debt service requirements, investments, and acquisitions.
› Limiting the Company’s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in 
the business or market conditions and placing the Company at a competitive 
disadvantage compared to its competitors who are less highly leveraged and who 
therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that Nexperia’s leverage 
prevents it from exploiting.
Nexperia seeks to manage and mitigate this risk through 
employing a stringent treasury management policy and 
performing detailed planning prior to entering into any 
additional financing agreements.

Compliance Risk 
Risk title Risk description Strategy to address the risk
Business integrity, ethics and 
compliance 
Due to the nature of Nexperia’s products and business model, certain environmental 
laws and other regulations expose the Company to risks regarding compliance with 
these laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are sometimes unique in 
every jurisdiction in which Nexperia operates. These regulations govern, among 
other things, emissions of pollutants into the air, wastewater discharges, the use and 
handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal, the investigation and remediation 
of soil and ground water contamination, and the health and safety of the employees. 
Failure to adhere to these regulations can lead to financial penalties, sanctions etc.
The management of Nexperia fully understands the risks 
regarding compliance. In order to successfully mitigate this, 
Nexperia has appointed experienced employees across all 
jurisdictions that is responsible for ensuring compliance with 
related laws and regulations in line with the Three Lines 
of Defense Model (TLD). Nexperia also ensures that this 
experience is updated regularly through external trainings.
Tax compliance risks across 
jurisdictions including tax 
rate risk
Since Nexperia operates internationally, the Group is subjected to various tax 
jurisdictions. Failure to adhere and the uncertainty of these different tax rules can lead 
to penalties, interests, and other financial losses. With regards to the Group’s transfer 
pricing agreements in place, Nexperia also runs the risk that the uncertainty regarding 
these lead to disputes and financial losses.
Nexperia cannot give any assurance as to what its effective tax rate will be in the 
future, because of, among other things, uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the 
jurisdictions where it conducts its business. The Company’s actual effective tax rate 
may vary from its expectation and that variance may be material. Additionally, the tax 
laws of the Netherlands, and other jurisdictions could change in the future, and such 
changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate.
To mitigate this risk, Nexperia has employed tax professionals 
and ensure that these individuals are appropriately updated 
at all times. Specific direct and indirect tax risks are managed 
through specific tax controls, which are assessed on a regular 
basis.

Compliance Risk 
Risk title Risk description Strategy to address the risk
Fraud risk The Company is exposed to various fraud risks that include bribery, corruption, and 
breaches against the company's Code of Conduct, along with the theft or misuse of 
assets (misappropriation). These risks may originate from both internal and external 
parties, organized to obtain money, property, or services, evade payment, or gain an 
unfair advantage for personal or business benefit. Such fraudulent activities can have 
serious consequences for the company, jeopardizing its integrity, financial stability, 
and reputation.
With regard to Nexperia’s Code of conduct, management has 
implemented a mandatory training program for all Nexperia 
employees.
Potential fraud cases are investigated and reviewed by 
the Ethics Committee, which also decides on possible 
risk response measures like follow ups by the Internal 
Audit Department or additional investigations by external 
specialists, if needed. The Chairman of the Board is informed 
accordingly.
Additionally, all employees and stakeholders can report 
possible misconduct via external, independent and 
anonymous SpeakUp Line that is available 24/7 in all relevant 
languages.

ESG Risks
Risk title Risk description Strategy to address risk
Environmental risks Environmental and other disasters like pandemics, may negatively impact the Nexperia 
business or directly impact its manufacturing facilities. Even if the manufacturing 
facilities are not directly damaged, a large natural disaster may result in disruptions 
in distribution channels or supply chains and significant increases in the prices of raw 
materials used for its manufacturing process. Furthermore, any disaster affecting 
the customers (or their respective customers) may negatively impact the demand 
for Nexperia’s products and revenues significantly. The impact of any such natural 
disasters depends on the specific geographic circumstances but could be significant, 
as some of the factories are in areas with known earthquake fault zones and, flood or 
storm risks.
The Company cannot predict the economic impact, if any, of 
possible disasters including pandemics or climate change. 
Nexperia has however implemented thorough business 
continuity plans to minimize the risk, if possible, in the event 
of a disaster as explained.
Furthermore, the Company continuously screens the 
legislative requirements for new/upcoming ESG regulations 
e.g., CSRD and enhances the risk management process 
accordingly. 
Nexperia initiated a ESG strategy project to improve the GRI 
reporting and perform ESG Rating.  
Pandemic risks Pandemic risks like COVID-19 are causing negative effects for the worldwide economy. 
Such risks could impact Nexperia’s supply chains, the production process, and sales 
activities, because of regulative restrictions and limitations imposed by governmental 
authorities. 
Immediately after the virus outbreak in January 2020 
Nexperia has activated crisis management teams for all 
major sites to closely monitor the pandemic risk and take 
appropriate risk response measure for the health and safety 
of its employees and to continue its business under these 
circumstances. 
Nexperia’s Board and Executive Management Team are 
informed on an ongoing basis with regard to the planning 
assumptions. Nexperia has established local pandemic 
procedures for every operating site.

Taxation
In line with our core values, we are 
committed to observing all applicable tax 
laws, rules, regulations, reporting, and 
disclosure requirements wherever we are 
obligated to do so due to our business 
presence and transactions. 
Our tax policy is linked to our Code of 
Conduct, which sets out guiding principles 
on integrity and ethics in our business 
conduct. Nexperia’s management has 
adopted the Code of Conduct to underpin 
the commitment to socially responsible 
corporate citizenship and the pursuit of a 
sustainable future – economically, socially, 
and environmentally.
As a responsible taxpayer, Nexperia’s 
tax planning is based on long-term 
considerations and takes into account the 
interests of all stakeholders. Therefore, 
we believe it is essential to have a set of 
guiding tax principles and communicate 
our tax approach openly and clearly.
Tax principles
Compliance
In all its tax affairs, Nexperia is committed to complying 
with all relevant laws, rules, regulations, and reporting 
and disclosure requirements wherever we operate. We 
are guided by recognized international standards, such 
as the OECD Guidelines, and comply with both the spirit 
and the letter of the tax laws and regulations.
Tax governance
Nexperia’s group tax department is in continuous 
dialogue with senior management and the business 
groups. This ensures management is engaged and 
involved in all relevant tax matters. 
Our tax department is organized to ensure compliance 
with all tax laws and regulations in the countries where 
we operate. It is a centralized organization that manages 
both regional and functional requirements. Additionally, 
the organization regularly engages with external tax 
advisors and/or local tax authorities to ensure our tax 
obligations are correctly handled and disclosed in our 
annual and quarterly reports.
The tax team is part of the finance department 
reporting to the Chief Financial Officer (CFO). The CFO is 
responsible for regularly updating the audit committee, 
with support from the tax department.

Page 59:
Transfer pricing 
Nexperia operates in many different tax jurisdictions, 
and there are many transactions between group 
companies. As a result, the transfer pricing for these 
transactions must reflect an “arm’s length” or market 
price. Our pricing is driven by the activities undertaken 
and the value created in each segment of our business 
according to OECD transfer pricing guidelines. This 
compliance should ensure all parties receive fair 
remuneration for their services. Our alignment with 
the arm’s length principle is supported by frequent 
benchmarking.
Nexperia does not have a presence in blacklisted 
jurisdictions (as defined by the European Union) 
and does not use artificial structures to achieve tax 
advantages or minimize tax liabilities.
Relationships with tax authorities
Nexperia seeks to foster constructive, professional, 
and transparent relationships with tax authorities 
based on integrity, collaboration, and mutual trust. 
We are committed to the principles of openness and 
transparency in our approach to dealing with tax 
authorities wherever we operate around the world. 
We aim to conduct all dealings with tax authorities and 
other relevant bodies in a collaborative, courteous, and 
timely manner. To avoid any potential tax disputes, we 
aim to secure early agreements on disputed matters and 
achieve upfront certainty wherever possible. 
Tax planning and incentives
Nexperia believes it should pay the tax amounts 
legally due in any territory. However, there will be 
some circumstances where this amount may not be 
clearly defined, or alternative approaches may result in 
differing tax outcomes. In these cases, we will use our 
best judgment to determine the appropriate course 
of action, using available reliefs and incentives where 
possible. These positions taken will be documented in 
a transparent manner and shared with local authorities 
where deemed appropriate.
The most important tax incentives for which Nexperia 
is eligible relate to the areas of innovation and R&D. 
Nexperia may engage in tax planning initiatives and 
use incentives and reliefs to minimize the tax costs of 
conducting its business activities. Nexperia also believes 
that such planning requires due consideration of 
Nexperia’s legitimate interests, reputation, brand, and 
corporate social responsibility. Nexperia will not use tax 
planning for purposes that are knowingly contradictory 
to the intent of the legislation. 
As a good corporate citizen, Nexperia does not enter 
into aggressive tax planning structures, use so-called 
“tax havens” for tax avoidance, or create artificial tax 
structures with no commercial or operational substance.
Transparency
We are transparent in our approach to tax and our tax 
position. We disclose information in accordance with 
relevant domestic regulations and applicable reporting 
requirements and standards, such as IFRS. We also 
strive to maintain an open dialogue on tax matters with 
governments, policymakers, businesses, investors, and 
civil society.
Accountability and governance
A responsible tax approach is essential to the 
sustainability of our business. We employ diligent 
professional care and judgment to assess tax risks 
and arrive at well-reasoned conclusions on how they 
should be managed. In cases of uncertainty around the 
application or interpretation of tax law, we may take 
appropriate written advice evidencing the facts, risks, 
and conclusions from third-party advisers to support our 
decision-making process. 
Nexperia uses a tax risk management framework to 
identify, mitigate, manage, and report tax risks globally. 
We maintain policies and procedures at global and 
local levels for key tax processes, including compliance, 
transfer pricing, and risk management. This tax approach 
should ensure that we apply professional diligence and 
care in managing all risks associated with tax matters 
as well as appropriate governance and assurance 
procedures.
“A responsible tax 
approach is essential 
to the sustainability of 
our business.”

We assess our environmental impacts, 
risks, and opportunities and set goals 
and objectives to enhance our positive 
outcomes while reducing negative 
ones. To achieve these goals, we 
implement programs and processes 
that are monitored quarterly using Key 
Performance Indicators (KPIs), and we 
update our goals and programs annually. 
The KPIs, goals, and objectives are 
described in the respective chapters of 
this report.
Additionally, as part of our membership 
in the Responsible Business Alliance 
(RBA), each of our manufacturing sites 
is required to complete an annual RBA 
Self-Assessment Questionnaire that 
also covers environmental topics and 
management systems. These self-
assessments help us evaluate potentially 
significant environmental risks at our 
manufacturing sites and apply suitable 
mitigation and control measures.
Our overall sustainable corporate 
governance structure is embedded in 
the Nexperia Management System, 
detailed in the "Our Approach to 
ESG" chapter of this report. Our 
Chief Operations Officer (COO) has 
overall accountability for the general 
Nexperia Management System, which 
includes environmental management. 
The Head of Global Environment, 
Health & Safety (EHS) is accountable 
for the implementation of our global 
EHS Management System. They 
are supported by the Manager EHS 
Management System, who is responsible 
for the system's documentation 
and coordinating EHS certification. 
Additional environmental topics such as 
ECO-Products, Chemicals Management, 
and audit support are managed by 
bespoke positions. Local EHS managers 
and teams provide additional support 
and function as Nexperia’s EHS 
team. Our Vice President Front End 
Operations, Global Real Estate and 
Facilities, and EHS is responsible for 
the effectiveness of the Management 
System. 
Our internal environmental data 
management software allows us to track 
company-wide metrics and performance 
targets set by our management. 
We report our data and update our 
management teams each quarter, 
ensuring our progress is transparent and 
we identify areas of development and 
improvement.
We also conduct annual internal audits 
at our headquarters and manufacturing 
sites to maintain compliance with ISO 
14001 management system standards. 
Additionally, we perform internal annual 
audits at our Hamburg (Germany) 
and Newport (UK) site to comply with 
ISO 50001. We conduct these audits 
in accordance with the global audit 
procedure guideline, which ensures 
standardized audits across all sites.
Nexperia’s Data Management System 
tracks and calculates our environmental 
data for each site to provide a global 
overview of our performance. Each 
site submits its environmental data on 
a quarterly basis, which is analyzed, 
validated, and reported on a corporate 
level. 
The validation stage comprises several 
steps: 
› First, we check the completeness 
of the data to ensure all sites and 
parameters have been measured and 
reported. Next, we compare the latest 
data against the previous reporting 
years to identify any significant 
changes. If any significant changes are 
identified, we assess their magnitude 
and investigate their causes. 
› Second, we investigate external 
factors that may have impacted 
the data, such as power outages or 
weather events. 
› In the final step, we validate the data 
to ensure it is accurate and reflects our 
actual environmental performance.

Emissions
3-3, 305
Relevant GRI 
Standards: 
As the impacts of climate change 
intensify worldwide, companies 
across all industries are being held 
accountable for their carbon footprint 
and environmental impact. As a 
semiconductor company, we recognize 
that we must take responsibility for 
our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, 
which trap heat in Earth's atmosphere 
and contribute to global warming 
and climate change. The 1997 UN 
Kyoto Protocol defined the six main 
greenhouse gases as carbon dioxide 
(CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide 
(N2O), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), 
and fluorinated gases, summarized 
as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and 
perfluorocarbons (PFCs). Even though 
sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) does not belong 
to the group of PFCs, it is common in the 
semiconductor industry to report these 
emissions together as PFC emissions.
As our industry evolves and 
semiconductors grow in capacity, 
their manufacturing is becoming more 
complex and requires more energy 
and processing chemicals. In 2023, a 
drop in production volume combined 
with the underutilization of several 
factories resulted in a slight decrease 
in Nexperia’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions 
compared to 2022. Scope 1, 2, and 
3 emissions refer to the different 
GHG emissions that comprise an 
organization’s overall carbon footprint. 
At Nexperia, we track our Scope 1 
emissions, which we generate internally 
through on-site manufacturing and 
stationary fuel combustion. We also 
monitor our Scope 2 emissions, which 
are generated externally from the 
electricity we purchase from utilities. 
As our business continues to grow, 
we are committed to mitigating our 
environmental impact by optimizing 
our processes, embracing greener 
alternatives, and decreasing our direct 
GHG emissions where possible.

Definition of greenhouse gas emissions
Our structure for managing GHG emissions is 
described in the “Environmental Management 
at Nexperia” chapter. The topic of GHG and 
non-GHG emissions is part of our Responsible 
Business Alliance (RBA) Validated Assessment 
Programs (VAP) audits and internal audits 
according to our Environmental Management 
System. The topic of Nexperia’s physical and 
transitional climate risks is part of our enterprise 
risk management and, therefore, within the 
responsibility scope of Nexperia’s Board. We 
are committed to elevating our climate risk 
management procedures and managing all 
relevant climate risks.
This chapter focuses on our four primary 
sources of carbon emissions: purchased 
electricity, use of PFCs, fossil fuels we combust 
directly, and heat-transfer fluids (HTFs), which 
are integral substances used in semiconductor 
manufacturing to transfer heat from one 
point to another. Nexperia is committed 
to increasing its contribution to a net-zero 
economy. Our long-term target is to be carbon 
neutral across our global operations by 2035, 
including direct operational emissions (Scope 1) 
and indirect emissions associated with energy 
procurement (Scope 2). Due to the lack of 
available technological solutions by 2035 and 
the calculation methods to be used, e.g., for 
PFC emissions, Nexperia is aware that some 
emissions cannot be avoided and must be offset 
through compensation.
64
ENVIRONMENTAL REPORTINGnexperia | Sustainability Report 2023Emissions

Page 65:
In 2023, Nexperia introduced a 
comprehensive GHG Emissions Reduction 
Roadmap. It summarizes our strategic 
approach to achieving carbon neutrality, 
which includes quantified targets, emission-
reducing initiatives, and expert partnerships. 
It also gives stakeholders a transparent 
view of our ongoing progress in key 
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) 
topics. In the reporting year, Nexperia’s 
efforts in these areas were recognized by 
renowned third parties in the capital market. 
For more information, the chapter “ESG 
Risk Rating” details Nexperia’s Sustainalytics 
Rating and $800 million Sustainability-
Linked Loan.
Our GHG Emissions Reduction Roadmap 
underscores our commitment to 
sustainable business growth and 
provides an efficient and realistic 
pathway to achieving carbon neutrality 
by 2035 (for Scope 1 and 2 emissions). 
We have also set mid-term goals as 
progress milestones: we aim to reduce 
our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 4% a 
year between 2024 and 2029 (a linear 
reduction against a 2022 baseline). We 
calculate our carbon footprint based 
on the GHG Protocol, an internationally 
recognized standard for quantifying and 
reporting GHG emissions. 
Project governance and strategic management
Robust project governance is the backbone of our GHG 
Emissions Reduction Roadmap, and accountability across our 
organization is vital. For these reasons, we have established a 
multidisciplinary team responsible for our Roadmap’s day-to-
day management and implementation. It comprises experts 
in sustainability, technology, and project management to 
coordinate and align the many complex and interrelated topics. 
Given the semiconductor industry’s dynamic nature and 
unique resource requirements, achieving carbon neutrality is a 
significant challenge for Nexperia. In response, we emphasize 
continuously developing our internal expertise and building 
partnerships with industry peers, governmental bodies, and 
sustainability organizations (see our “Approach to ESG” chapter). 
We also proactively consult with external experts, who have 
made valuable contributions to developing our Roadmap and 
incorporating best practices from the countries and regions 
where we operate. 
Keyword: carbon neutral 
Carbon neutrality refers to activities releasing zero carbon 
emissions (and equivalents) into the atmosphere. The first step 
involves tracking emissions and working to reduce them as 
much as possible. Nexperia uses the term carbon neutrality to 
reference achieving net-zero emissions in our operations (Scopes 
1 and 2) by 2035. We will offset any (direct or indirect) remaining 
emissions that cannot be avoided through activities that remove 
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

The 2018–2020 period includes five manufacturing sites, whereas the 2021–2023 period includes six. This difference explains the increase in emissions from 2021 compared to previous years.  
(Since there is no secured data for the additionally purchased locations before 2020, the data was not corrected in accordance with the specifications of the GHG Protocol for the years before 2020. 
Because 2022 is the base year for our mid-term target and the long-term target, this is considered acceptable).
Nexperia’s path toward carbon neutrality: 
reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions
In 2023, we took a range of measures to monitor 
and reduce Nexperia’s global Scope 1 and 2 
emissions in line with our GHG Emissions Reduction 
Roadmap. 
Overall, our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions 
decreased by 2% compared to 2022 due to lower 
production volumes and the underutilization 
of several factories. This decreased production 
volume also led to reduced electricity and HTF 
consumption. Our normalized Scope 1 and 2 
emissions increased by 3% compared to 2022 
due to introducing new process technologies and 
preparing our sites to meet future production 
volumes, which also increased our PFC 
emissions. Considering the long-term development 
of normalized emissions, we have achieved a 19% 
reduction since Nexperia’s foundation in 2017, 
driven by our collective efforts in the previous 
decade.

Reducing Scope 1 emissions
Nexperia's Scope 1 emissions are those directly 
released by our activities, including consuming or 
burning fossil fuels (e.g., natural gas, diesel, liquefied 
petroleum gas (LPG), and gasoline), the use of PFCs 
(including SF6), N2O, and releasing HTFs. Nexperia does 
not produce biogenic Scope 1 emissions or emissions 
from ozone-depleting substances. To reduce our 
Scope 1 emissions, we focus on designing or installing 
more efficient equipment, substituting chemicals with 
more sustainable alternatives, and optimizing our 
manufacturing processes.
PFCs are crucial for semiconductor manufacturing, 
and no alternatives are currently available. Despite 
this challenge, we have taken measures to minimize 
their environmental impact, including signing the 
Memorandum of Agreement in Europe and supporting 
the Global Semiconductor Industry PFC voluntary 
agreement. While our PFC consumption increased by 
12% in 2023 due to greater product complexity, our 
absolute PFC emissions increased by only 7% to 71,450 
tons of CO2 equivalent (CO2e), and our normalized PFC 
emissions by 13% compared to 2022. Our calculation 
of PFC emissions is based on the IPCC 2019 tier 2c 
model. A more detailed explanation can be found 
below in the "Perfluorocarbons PFCs" chapter.
After many years of optimizing our processes to reduce 
CO2e emissions (CO2 e), it has become difficult to 
achieve additional large-scale reductions. Nevertheless, 
we embraced this challenge by establishing a new 
program in 2022 to further reduce our Scope 1 CO2 
emissions and our normalized PFC emissions by 2025. 
Our PFC Policy aims to lower PFC emissions to less 
than 1.25 tons of CO2e per m2 (2023: 1.72 tons of CO2e 
per m2). Data for the PFC Policy and 2023 value was 
recalculated for IPCC 2019 tier 2c.
67
ENVIRONMENTAL REPORTINGnexperia | Sustainability Report 2023Emissions

Page 68:
After an inspection in 2023, we concluded that 
the PFC reporting for 2022 was incorrect. We 
have updated our reporting methodology and 
updated our PFC data for 2022 (both IPCC 2006 
Tier 2a and IPCC 2019 Tier 2c). Previous years 
were not affected by this change.
In addition to PFCs, we also use HTFs in 
our manufacturing processes. After the 
replacement of several chillers in our facility in 
Newport (UK) during 2022, we have been able 
to reduce the equivalent CO2 emissions by 36% 
compared to 2022.
Another large share of our GHG emissions 
comes from using fossil fuels, primarily for 
natural gas heating and generating electricity 
and heat in combined heat and power plants. 
Our fossil fuel consumption varies, as it is 
primarily geared toward balancing weather 
conditions and associated fluctuating 
temperatures. In 2023, we installed another 
combined heat and power plant at our 
Manchester site (UK) to produce high-efficiency 
electricity and heat. We also use diesel fuel to 
power emergency systems and small amounts 
of LPG in Nexperia staff catering facilities, 
especially in Seremban (Malaysia) and Cabuyao 
(Philippines). We also use N2O in several stages 
of our manufacturing processes, including 
chemical vapor deposition, diffusion, and 
chamber seasoning. In 2023, our N2O usage 
increased by 31%, and the associated emissions 
were 4,691  tons of CO2e. We calculate our N2O 
emissions based on the IPCC 2019 tier 2c model 
(see “Calculating Perfluorocarbons”).
CALCULATING PERFLUOROCARBONS (PFCs)
In the semiconductor industry, CO2e emissions 
from PFCs are determined using a scientific 
accounting model based on research by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC). In 2019, the IPCC released a refinement 
of its 2006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse 
Gas Inventories (IPCC 2006), resulting in a new 
accounting model, IPCC 2019.
Under the methodology of this new model, 
Nexperia’s PFC emissions increased by 36% (based 
on 2023 data) compared to calculations using 
IPCC 2006. Therefore, calculations based on IPCC 
2006 Tier 2a cannot be compared to those based 
on IPCC 2019 Tier 2c.
For example, we used IPCC 2019 Tier 2c to 
calculate and compare our PFC emissions for 
2023, as well as 2022 and 2021. This report 
presents our Scope 1 emissions using calculations 
based on IPCC 2019 Tier 2c, and we have updated 
our historical Scope 1 emissions for 2021 and 
2022. As a result, our Scope 1 emissions for these 
years are now higher than previously reported.
In addition to the new methodology, Nexperia 
uses a unique PFC gas (C3F8) and process 
combination that the IPCC has not yet 
investigated. Consequently, our emissions 
calculations must use relatively unfavorable 
factors to comply with IPCC guidelines, even if 
they do not clearly identify our specific use case. 
This fact alone resulted in 6% higher emissions 
(based on 2023 data) compared to the previous 
calculation model.
The amounts of PFC gases Nexperia used in 2023 
was higher than previous years. This increase 
was due to producing more complex products 
with more processing steps requiring PFC gases. 
Compared to 2022, our CO2e emissions from PFC 
gases increased by 7% (based on ESIA tier 2c IPCC 
2019_AR5 tool).
Despite this increase, we remain committed to 
our PFC Policy and strive to achieve a value of  
< 1.25 tons CO2e/m2 (data recalculated for IPCC 
2019 tier 2c) by 2025. In 2023, our value was 
1.72 tons of CO2e/m2.
The previous chart illustrates the disparities in 
calculation methodologies. For our historical 
data up to 2020, we continue using results based 
on IPCC 2006 Tier 2a methodology. From 2021 
onward, we have adopted the new emission 
factors under IPCC 2019 Tier 2c, including further 
refinement by process type. 
In parallel to determining our emissions using this 
new method, we will continue using the previous 
method. This approach ensures our PFC reporting 
remains accurate and transparent.

Reducing Scope 2 emissions
Nexperia’s Scope 2 emissions are 
generated externally from the electricity 
we purchase from utilities. Since our 
foundation in 2017, we have emphasized 
a measured and realistic approach to 
increase our utilization of renewable 
energy sources. We aim to foster reliable 
long-term partnerships with relevant 
stakeholders, ensuring internationally 
accepted renewable energy contracts 
and certifications. This approach 
facilitates CO2 reductions across our 
back-end sites by utilizing credible 
green energy mechanisms tailored to 
our manufacturing sites’ locations and 
energy markets. These mechanisms 
include corporate power purchase 
agreements (PPAs), energy attribute 
certificates (EACs), green tariffs, on-site 
power generation, and other custom 
solutions. Since February 2023, Nexperia 
has also procured renewable electricity 
for all three of our front-end facilities.
To ensure our green investments make a 
meaningful, long-term impact, we work 
with external consultants to address our 
Scope 2 emissions. These collaborations 
help us identify risks, explore 
opportunities, and formulate strategies 
for procuring 100% renewable electricity 
across our back-end facilities. 
As a semiconductor company, our 
operations involve complex product 
manufacturing processes that require 
significant amounts of electricity. In 
2023, we experienced production volume 
decreases and underutilization across 
several factories compared to 2022. As 
a result, our absolute Scope 2 emissions 
decreased by 5% in 2023, while our 
normalized Scope 2 emissions increased 
by less than 1% compared to 2022. We 
calculate our Scope 2 emissions based on 
the GHG Protocol market-based approach 
and available emissions data from our 
energy providers.
Our ongoing sustainability efforts 
have decreased our absolute Scope 2 
emissions by 3% and our normalized 
value by a remarkable 40% compared 
to 2017. This substantial improvement 
reinforces our commitment to reducing 
our emissions intensity as we expand our 
operations. We continue exploring new 
opportunities to minimize our Scope 2 
emissions, such as investing in renewable 
energy sources, improving operational 
efficiency, and investigating alternative 
energy sources.

“In 2023, Nexperia committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 
2035, signaling an important step in our sustainability journey. This 
commitment encompasses a focus on mitigating both direct operational 
emissions (Scope 1) and the indirect emissions associated with 
energy procurement for operations (Scope 2). As we progress, we are 
continually strengthening our efforts, building upon this foundational 
commitment to ensure a sustainable future for generations to come.
But our vision extends beyond immediate operational impacts to 
encompass the broader scope of emissions across our global value 
chain. Recognizing and addressing Scope 3 emissions, which represent 
indirect emissions associated with our supply chain and product lifecycle, 
is integral to our commitment to environmental stewardship. This 
comprehensive strategy underscores our commitment to responsible 
business practices and aligns with our core values of transparency and 
accountability.
As we navigate toward our carbon neutrality target, our ongoing efforts 
serve as a testament to Nexperia's commitment to sustainability. By 
integrating environmental considerations into our business strategy, 
we not only mitigate risks but also seize opportunities to drive positive 
change. Together, we are forging a path toward a greener, more resilient 
future, grounded in transparency, accountability, and a collective vision 
for a better world.”

Reducing Scope 3 emissions
Nexperia’s Scope 3 emissions are 
indirect emissions (not included in Scope 
2) that occur in the value chain of the 
reporting company, including both 
upstream and downstream emissions. 
We are committed to tackling our Scope 
3 emissions, which entails identifying 
relevant categories, gathering data, 
engaging with stakeholders, quantifying 
emissions, setting realistic goals, and 
generating measurable long-term 
impacts. As in the case of Scope 2 
emissions, we approach Scope 3 
reduction measures with an emphasis on 
thorough analysis, achieving the highest 
possible impact, and realistic feasibility. 
We are in the process of planning the 
next steps for accurate and complete 
Scope 3 data collection.
Non-greenhouse gas emissions
While GHG emissions negatively 
influence Earth’s climate, there are 
many other substances companies emit 
that can negatively impact human and 
the environmental health. Of these 
non-GHG emissions, nitrogen oxides 
(NOx) and volatile organic compounds 
(VOCs) are most relevant to Nexperia. 
These emissions primarily result from 
our combined heat and power plants 
and manufacturing processes involving 
the use of chemical solvents in the 
photolithography process, as well as 
emissions from boilers and emergency 
generators.
NOx emissions result mainly from 
burning fossil fuels in power plants or 
abatement systems. They contribute to 
the formation of smog, which can lead 
to respiratory problems and intensify 
existing heart and lung diseases. In 2023, 
our NOx emissions decreased by 34% to 
21 tons, compared to 32 tons in 2022. 
The higher value in 2022 was due to our 
use of emergency power systems in the 
UK during several energy supply issues in 
early 2022.
VOCs, such as chemical solvents, are 
used in the photolithographic processes 
of semiconductor manufacturing. 
Their use results in VOC emissions that 
remain after going through exhaust air 
treatment systems. These emissions 
contribute to the formation of ground-
level ozone, which is harmful to human 
health and the environment. Our VOC 
emissions decreased by 3% in 2023 to 
23.6 tons.

Overview and  
management approach
Efficient resource and energy management 
are critical aspects of sustainability in the 
semiconductor industry. At Nexperia, our 
key materials include lead frames, mold 
compounds, raw silicon wafers, processing 
chemicals, and various types of equipment 
and spare parts. Semiconductor production 
also requires significant amounts of energy, 
which is why we continuously analyze our 
materials and energy use to find new areas 
where we can improve.

Our Procurement department is responsible for sourcing materials. 
At the board level, our Chief Procurement Officer (CPO) holds 
overall accountability and reports relevant information to the other 
board members. Our formal procurement process is detailed in 
the “Responsible Sourcing and Supplier Engagement” chapter. The 
Procurement department works closely within the Environment, 
Health, and Safety (EHS) Management structure described in the 
“Environmental Management at Nexperia” chapter. 
Our certified Environmental Management System governs our 
efficient energy initiatives and the environmental aspects of 
our material procurement. Our sites in Hamburg (Germany) and 
Newport (UK) are certified to ISO 50001, a global standard in 
energy management systems. Our compliance with this standard 
underscores our commitment to reducing energy consumption and 
increasing operational efficiency. The certification of these two sites 
covers approximately 15% of our total workforce.
Our approach: making production more 
efficient and embracing green energy
Our manufacturing locations draw 
the majority of their energy from the 
power grid and, whenever possible, 
purchase renewable energy. However, 
in regions where reliable and abundant 
renewable sources are not yet available, 
we rely on electricity generated from 
fossil fuels. We also use natural gas to 
efficiently produce electricity and heat 
through combined heat and power 
(CHP) plants. These plants are crucial 
for powering the heating, cooling, and 
humidity management equipment 
we rely on in our manufacturing 
processes. We also use abatement 
systems that effectively decompose 
climate-damaging process gases. In 
emergencies, we use small amounts of 
diesel to fuel our generators to mitigate 
the risk of power outages.
We have steadily increased our 
production capacity since the 
foundation of our company. At the 
same time, we are manufacturing 
increasingly complex products and 
introducing new process technologies 
to create more environmentally 
friendly solutions for end users. As 
these advanced products and process 
technologies require more energy, our 
manufacturing sites continually work to 
optimize their processes and replace or 
upgrade equipment to minimize energy 
use. Additionally, as part of our EHS 
Management System, we set annual 
targets for each site to incrementally 
decrease its electricity consumption, 
supported by specific reduction and 
efficiency measures such as integrating 
advanced low-energy technology in 
our production lines and conducting 
targeted employee awareness 
campaigns.
Some other examples of our energy 
efficiency measures include:
› Reducing and optimizing exhaust and 
air-extraction systems 
› Upgrading air dryers 
› Purchasing energy-efficient chillers, 
compressors, and vacuum pumps 
› Turning equipment off when it is not 
in use 
› Using waste heat to produce cooling 
via adsorption chillers
In 2023, while our absolute electricity 
consumption remained stable, these 
efficiency measures reduced our 
normalized electricity consumption 
(kWh/m2) by 12% compared to 2017.

In addition to reducing our electricity 
consumption, we are committed to 
utilizing more sustainable sources. 
Globally, renewables currently supply 
around 40% of our purchased electricity. 
Since 2020, our sites in Hamburg 
(Germany) and Manchester (UK) have 
purchased 100% renewable electricity, 
and our last front-end fab in Newport 
(UK) achieved this goal in early 2023. 
While we are exploring opportunities to 
utilize more green electricity in our back-
end facilities, sourcing renewables poses 
unique challenges in some regions. The 
Asian market, for example, features 
diverse regulatory landscapes across 
many different countries. In response, 
we strive to develop effective solutions 
tailored to each site, working closely 
with local experts to gain detailed 
knowledge of evolving markets. 
Along with electricity, we rely on several 
fossil fuels in our operations. These 
include natural gas, diesel, and small 
amounts of gasoline and liquified petrol 
gas (LPG). We primarily use natural 
gas to generate electricity and heat 
efficiently, heat buildings, produce 
steam for humidity, and power our 
emissions-abatement equipment. 
Our use of natural gas is influenced 
by external weather conditions and 
our internal production activities. For 
example, due to installing an additional 
combined heat and power plant at 
our site in Manchester, our natural gas 
consumption increased by 11% in 2023.
We also use emergency diesel 
generators to support our essential 
safety systems during power outages. 
Our diesel consumption varies 
depending on the frequency of testing 
and the need for these emergency 
systems. In 2023, we used 24 tons of 
diesel globally. In addition to natural 
gas and diesel, we use gasoline for 
forklifts and LPG in some of our on-site 
cafeterias. 
In 2023, Nexperia consumed around 
2,245,268 GJ of energy globally. The 
energy intensity recorded as GJ/m2 
amounted to 54 GJ/m2.

Our approach:  
Using resources carefully and efficiently
There are many different resources 
used in semiconductor manufacturing, 
some of which can negatively impact 
people or the environment. One 
particularly relevant category of these 
resources is chemicals. To reduce their 
adverse effects, we have ongoing 
containment actions and substitute 
potentially harmful chemicals with 
safer alternatives. As part of our 
Environmental Management System, 
we also employ an active Chemicals 
Management System to review all 
chemicals used in our production and 
identify critical chemicals.
As a large-scale semiconductor 
manufacturer, we also use rare earth 
metals and minerals. To protect the 
environment and uphold human 
rights, we pay particular attention to 
materials that may come from conflict-
affected and high-risk areas (CAHRAs). 
This is described in more detail in the 
“Responsible Sourcing and Supplier 
Engagement” chapter. 
When selecting materials, we seek to 
minimize our impact on people and 
the environment. Although we must 
consider quality specifications and the 
purity grade of production materials, 
there are also growing opportunities 
to use recycled materials. These can 
include reclaimed or refurbished wafers, 
recycled gold, and backside plates of 
targets. We also apply shield cleaning 
instead of buying new ones, and may 
reuse manufacturers’ wafer cassettes to 
transport our wafers to back-end sites. 
These are just a few measures we are 
adopting to make our production more 
sustainable, efficient, and ethical. In 
line with our sustainability roadmap, 
we are also intensifying our focus on 
responsible and green material sourcing.

Overview and  
management approach
Water is a critical natural resource, and it is 
also essential for Nexperia's semiconductor 
production. As part of our commitment 
to sustainability, we strive to use water 
responsibly, working to preserve natural 
water resources and minimize our impact on 
communities and the environment. These aims 
are reflected in our global water strategy, 
which focuses on conservation, recycling, and 
high standards for wastewater treatment and 
discharge. 
Through our Sustainability Policy, we are 
committed to reducing our relative overall 
water use and consumption as we continue 
growing as a company. For example, we strive 
to reuse water wherever possible and have 
implemented reduction programs at all our 
sites.

Our approach: understanding and 
reducing our water footprint
Even before Nexperia was established in 2017, we 
continually worked to conserve water – for over 30 
years at some facilities – and achieved considerable 
savings in relation to our output. While the success 
of these efforts prior to our base year of 2017 means 
additional large-scale reductions are no longer 
practical, we continuously emphasize the use of more 
efficient tools, seek new opportunities to recycle 
water, and strive to optimize our processes. As a 
result, we have kept our water consumption relatively 
low compared to 2017 and substantially reduced our 
normalized water footprint since our foundation. 
We believe it is also essential to understand the 
broader impacts of water availability on society 
and the environment. In addition to impacting our 
manufacturing sites, water access affects other 
industrial, agricultural, and residential users in the 
regions where we operate. By using less water, we can 
help increase the supply for others in our communities. 
Therefore, our global water approach focuses on 
water conservation and recycling while maintaining 
high standards for our wastewater treatment and 
discharge.
We also understand that our water demands will rise 
as our production increases and that it is not viable 
to dramatically reduce the total amount of water we 
use in our manufacturing processes. Therefore, we are 
working to increase our water recycling rate compared 
to previous years. In 2023, we reclaimed 20% of our 
water, amounting to nearly 1 million cubic meters of 
water globally.  
Water and wastewater management are integral aspects of our 
environmental, health, and safety (EHS) Management System, outlined 
in the “Environmental Management at Nexperia” chapter. We also 
conduct risk assessments to calculate more general water-related risks, 
such as flooding or tsunamis, and have established crisis management 
plans to address these potential hazards. 
As part of our commitment to conserving water, we place a particular 
focus on water-scarce areas. For example, many of our manufacturing 
and testing facilities are in regions that may become vulnerable 
to prolonged droughts associated with climate change, leading to 
resource scarcity. Therefore, based on location, our manufacturing 
facilities assess the impacts of water scarcity and identify best practices 
to conserve and recycle water to meet our goals.
77
ENVIRONMENTAL REPORTINGnexperia | Sustainability Report 2023Water and Wastewater Management

Page 78:
To measure and manage our water use effectively, we 
use the water-related KPI “cubic meters water usage per 
square meter produced silicon.” This KPI allows us to set 
and monitor yearly targets to reduce the water intensity 
of our manufacturing sites. We track our progress 
through regular EHS and Social Responsibility reporting 
and analysis, which ensure we continuously improve our 
water efficiency and management.
We treat our industrial wastewater on-site to 
prevent environmental pollution, in line with local 
requirements and our Environmental Management 
System. The treated industrial wastewater, as well as 
further wastewater flows from the air-conditioning of 
production rooms, sanitary facilities, or canteens, are 
discharged in accordance with local laws and permits. 
Parts of the water also evaporate. 
In addition, our Stormwater Management Policy aims to 
prevent the release of pollutants into the environment 
during stormwater runoff. All our manufacturing sites 
complete the included risk assessment template, which 
forms a risk evaluation for each location. The water

management requirements and procedures are 
fully auditable and guarantee our compliance 
with laws and regulations in our countries 
of operation. We also periodically monitor 
and control the effectiveness of all related 
measures.
Local authorities define substances of concern 
in wastewater streams in the discharge 
permits. We continually analyze and review 
their acceptable limits. These measures help 
to progressively reduce our impacts on water 
availability and the environment.
We monitor water data at the site level in 
compliance with local requirements. Our sites then 
enter their data into the Group-wide environmental 
data management software each quarter, where 
it is checked and analyzed centrally. We source 
approximately 90% of our water from third-party 
providers and extract the remaining amounts 
internally from groundwater sources.
Projects
Since the foundation of Nexperia in 2017, we have continually 
worked to reduce our water demand on a site-level basis. This 
commitment is guided by our Sustainability Policy and ongoing 
improvement efforts. Our dedication to improving water 
sustainability has led to significant water savings and more 
efficient usage at multiple sites. In addition, we are continually 
launching new initiatives and projects to reduce our demands 
on precious natural water sources. Many of these technically 
challenging projects are ongoing but are already yielding positive 
results. In 2022, we reclaimed 19%; in 2023, we reclaimed 20% 
of the total water used.

Waste Management
Overview and management approach
Semiconductor manufacturing generates hazardous and non–
hazardous waste streams, including solvents, acids, and metal 
plating waste. Our operations also produce paper, plastic, 
wood, metal, electronic, kitchen, and general office waste. 
We understand that reducing or eliminating waste streams 
contributes to greater operational efficiencies and a more 
sustainable circular economy.
At Nexperia, waste management is part of our broader 
Environmental Management System, detailed in the 
“Environmental Management at Nexperia” chapter of this report. 
Our commitment to reducing all waste is reflected in our Code 
of Conduct, Sustainability Policy, and our ongoing efforts to 
phase out hazardous substances wherever possible.
Nexperia maintains high standards when it comes to waste 
management. Each site closely monitors its generated waste 
and separates it based on its type and specific requirements for 
handling or disposal. To ensure the safe and proper disposal of 
waste - particularly hazardous materials - we collaborate with 
partners who specialize in handling specific types of waste.
3-3, 306
Relevant GRI 
Standards: 
Regular waste is defined as recycled, non-
hazardous or hazardous waste generated 
during normal production activities.
One-time waste is defined as recycled, non-hazardous or 
hazardous waste generated outside normal production 
activities. Examples are building or rebuilding work, 
building demolition, clean-up after move to other premises, 
replacement of equipment, etc.
80
ENVIRONMENTAL REPORTINGnexperia | Sustainability Report 2023Waste Management

Page 81:
We generate regular and ongoing 
hazardous and non–hazardous waste 
in our manufacturing activities, offices, 
canteens. We also produce so-called 
one-time waste in construction and 
other manufacturing. Our waste 
handling methods for either type comply 
with all local rules and regulations.
At our manufacturing sites, we collect 
manufacturing waste, including acids, 
solvents, waste molding compounds, 
and hazardous waste from metal 
plating; office waste, including paper, 
cardboard, and beverage containers; 
canteen waste, such as food and other 
compostable items; and items from 
support operations, including scrap 
metal, wood, and coolant chemicals. 
Each site separates its waste using 
appropriate disposal methods based on 
levels of hazardousness.
The main goal of our waste management 
is to reduce or completely eliminate 
waste or waste streams. For waste that 
cannot be avoided, we continuously seek 
solutions to increase reuse or recycling. 
In 2023, we recycled 83% of the regular 
waste in our manufacturing sites, based 
on definitions from local legislation.
At the beginning of each calendar year, 
we set recycling rate targets for each 
manufacturing site. We then monitor 
and record each site’s monthly waste 
generation and compare its recycling 
rates to its target, serving as the primary 
Key Performance Indicator for waste. 
We also consolidate this data on a 
global level. If a site is not on target, the 
general environmental management 
teams and local staff collaborate 
to identify the reasons and explore 
potential corrective actions.
We track each manufacturing site’s 
waste consumption for recycled and 
reused non-hazardous and hazardous 
waste in our EHS database every quarter.
Projects
Since our inception, we have implemented 
various projects to avoid, reduce, reuse, and 
recycle waste at all our sites worldwide.
In addition to these initiatives to reduce, 
reuse, and recycle waste at our sites 
worldwide, we are continuously exploring 
new and innovative ways to minimize waste 
and promote sustainability.
Our approach: reducing, recycling,  
and handling waste carefully 
At our site in Hamburg (Germany), 
we hold an annual campaign event 
to collect and recycle e-waste 
and metals from our employees. 
Collaborating with a local waste 
company, our staff can dispose of 
items that a partner then sells in the 
recycling market. The proceeds are 
donated to local charities benefiting 
children (see “Our Responsibility and 
Engagement” chapter).

Our approach:  
managing TeamNexperia
As a responsible employer, we maintain 
strict compliance with all regulations and 
legal agreements. We are also regularly 
involved in social dialogue with employee 
representation bodies, such as workers’ 
councils at the site level and trade unions 
at sectoral and national levels. We currently 
have collective bargaining agreements in 
place in several countries, such as Germany, 
the Philippines, the Netherlands, and our 
UK site in Manchester, reaching a collective 
bargaining coverage rate of about 30% of 
our global workforce.
We also support the aim of the International 
Labor Organization (ILO) to promote 
and realize universally accepted labor 
standards. We respect and recognize our 
employees’ freedom to establish, join, or be 
represented by an organization, trade union, 
or employee group of their choice. Across 
all of our global sites, our employees also 
have the freedom to associate and the right 
to collective bargaining as provided by local 
statutes. 
In our operating model, the HR function 
distinguishes three critical roles with unique 
focus areas. The three work together to 
find the optimal balance between various 
objectives that are important to the 
Company:
HR Business Partners 
safeguard and drive the 
impact of people on 
business performance 
and strategy execution. 
Country HR oversees 
our adherence and 
compliance with relevant 
legislation, maintains 
industrial relations, 
and ensures our local 
operational processes 
run smoothly. 
Centers of Expertise 
(CoE) support 
businesses, functions, 
and countries in their 
area of expertise 
while driving quality, 
professionalism, 
consistency, and 
innovation throughout 
the Company.

In the HR Leadership Team (HRLT), we seek 
to maintain a healthy balance between 
these three roles and facilitate constructive 
dialogue in policy-making and performance 
management. Within this structure, the 
Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO), 
a member of our Executive Management 
Team (EMT), acts as a natural escalation 
point. In addition, our VP Head of Talent, 
Learning & OD has been appointed as an 
operational representative of HR to the 
EMT. We generally structure our country 
HR management into HR generalists, local 
HR specialists, and payroll experts. This 
structure ensures Nexperia can continue 
expanding without needing to change its 
organizational design.
We also need a solid foundation of data 
collection to manage our workforce 
effectively. Therefore, we use Workday as 
our global Human Resources Information 
System (HRIS). At the site level, HR enters 
all employee data into the system, including 
job details, personal data, compensation 
information, and other work-related data. 
On a global level, the HRIS team can access 
all data and generate reports to collate 
employee information. Individual sites also 
use additional systems for purposes such as 
time registration and payroll.
As the success of our company relies on 
maintaining a motivated, well-trained 
workforce, we continually address the 
current and emerging challenges facing 
our HR departments as part of a human 
capital risk assessment. These challenges 
include the increasing competition for 
skilled personnel, rising trends of remote 
work and more diverse teams, and aging 
demographics in key locations. In response, 
our approach to addressing these HR 
challenges includes:
Conducting regular and 
more objective talent 
reviews by appraising 
objective performance 
KPIs and involving formal 
assessment committees 
in the process. 
Supporting Nexperia’s 
growth ambitions 
by incorporating 
internal and external 
benchmarking to ensure 
we achieve our bottom-
line results.
Investing in human 
capital and expanding 
into new regions and 
countries to achieve 
leading industry 
performance.
Engaging and retaining 
new and existing 
talent to support our 
enhancement of a unique 
and differentiated 
product portfolio.

members to progress within the Company. We 
believe our status as an attractive employer 
stems from our company’s strengths and 
offerings, which include:
› Our commitment to an inclusive and diverse 
corporate culture (described in more detail 
in the “Diversity, Non-Discrimination, and 
Inclusion” chapter).
› Offering highly competitive compensation 
and benefits packages.
› Investing in the professional and personal 
development of each individual (described 
in more detail in the “Talent Development”

In addition to attracting and retaining talent, 
our efforts have also won Nexperia several 
awards, including:
› For the second year in a row, Nexperia 
Germany won the “Top Company 2023” award 
from kununu – an online portal for employer 
evaluation – for being among the most 
popular employers in Germany, Austria, and 
Switzerland listed on the platform.

Adhering to the principle that happy and

success, Nexperia Malaysia has implemented a 
range of innovative programs - from wellness 
initiatives to opportunities for professional 
development - to foster a supportive and 
inclusive work environment.
We are committed to supporting TeamNexperia

and appreciated. As part of this goal, we 
acknowledge the long tenure of employees 
who have been with us since before Nexperia's

We manage the material topic of “Talent attraction 
and retention” as part of our HR management 
approach described in the “People Management at 
Nexperia” chapter of this report. With the help of 
our Human Resource Information System (HRIS), we 
measure the success of our initiatives and progress 
toward talent attraction and retention targets. Data 
points and KPIs include our retention rate and the 
time between job posting and hires (time to fill).
In addition to using the HRIS, we conduct an 
employee engagement survey every two years to 
understand our employees’ thoughts, perspectives, 
and concerns. 
Staff departure by gender and age, inclusive of voluntary resignations and other reasons for

For example, in Hamburg (Germany), our 
average employment length is 13 years. Other 
regions show similar results, with 9.5 years at 
our site in Cabuyao (Philippines) and 8.6 years 
in Manchester (UK). In 2023, our employee 
retention rate for indirect employees reached 
93.4%, indicating our ability to maintain a stable 
workforce over a given time frame.

of working at 
Nexperia
As a company, we engage with our 
employees through regular dialogue 
and during key stages such as our 
hiring process or staff exits. We use 
this feedback to improve our corporate 
culture and the working conditions of 
our employees. During this feedback 
process, our teams present and discuss 
results internally, coordinated by their 
managers. The teams then identify 
specific points and create action plans 
we can incorporate into our operating 
mechanisms, such as employee 
meetings, reviews, and performance 
discussions.
There are two important KPIs to 
measure the progress of our action 
plans: a high response rate and a high 
overall favorability rating. In 2023, 
the response rate was 93% of global 
employees, and the overall favorability 
of working at Nexperia was 84.7%, a 
4.4% decrease compared to the last 
survey in 2021. Customer Focus is the 
most favorable scoring category for 
Nexperia overall, with all items scoring 
above 80% favorable. 
› Strong results for Teamwork and 
Collaboration, with 9 out of 10 
employees agreeing that their team is 
committed to high-quality work. 
› Strong results with 9 out of 10 
employees agreeing that Nexperia 
provides a safe working environment. 
Despite declines across all items since 
2021, our employee survey results 
still exceed the external norms of 
our providers and industry peers. 
Our employees have shown interest 
in sharing their views on improving 
their workplace experience (93%), and 
we will act on their feedback. After 
hosting multiple manager sessions, we 
have initiated 842 action plans, with 
actions including attending external 
conferences or setting up internal award 
programs. To reduce bureaucracy, 
we plan to implement the Nexperia 
Management Model as a common 
language for reviews and logical, clear, 
fast, and efficient decision-making (for 
further details, see the “Responsibility of 
Management” chapter of this report). 
The survey covers our entire global 
workforce and includes questions 
covering a diverse range of perspectives 
and relevant HR-related topics, such as:
› Clarity of Direction
› Continuous Improvement
› Employment Engagement
› Customer Focus
› Performance Management
› Resources & Support 
› Manager Relationship
› Employment Empowerment
› Teamwork & Collaboration
› Growth & Development
› Recognition & Reward
› Values

Employee benefits
We aim to create engaging work environments 
supported by employee benefits that enhance 
their work-life balance. In addition to the 
competitive compensation and annual paid 
leave at each site, we offer employees annual 
incentive plans (linked to company performance) 
and sales incentive plans where appropriate. 
To show appreciation for our team members 
and their work, we award long-term service 
prizes to employees in some countries. We also 
support the ongoing well-being of our employees 
with discounted collective health insurance 
(in Malaysia, this also extends to employees’ 
children) as well as pension plans. To support our 
employees’ work-life balance and family planning 
activities, we offer pregnancy and maternity 
leave, parental leave, adoption, and foster care 
leave. In the Netherlands, employees are entitled 
to take long-term carer's leave to support 
family members who are facing life-threatening 
circumstances. In Germany and Hungary, we offer 
employees nursery and daycare support. We 
also provide advice to all employees through our 
Employee Assistance Programs, covering subjects 
such as work-life balance, managing life changes, 
parenting, and others.
In addition to state pension plans, our employees 
in several countries receive company pension 
benefits, as either defined benefit plans or 
defined contribution plans. Our defined benefit 
plans are differentiated by offering either 
pensions or post-retirement medical benefits. 
90
SOCIAL REPORTINGnexperia | Sustainability Report 2023 Talent Attraction and Retention

Page 91:
Benefits generally depend on factors such as 
an employee’s length of service, contributions, 
and compensation. They also factor in relevant 
labor, tax, and social security laws in the 
countries where the Company is located.
The obligations and the plan assets used to fund 
the obligations are subject to demographic, 
legal, and economic risks. Economic risks are 
primarily unforeseen developments in goods or 
capital markets.
Nexperia has a number of defined benefit 
pension plans. The largest plans are in Germany 
and the Philippines, representing 92% of our 
total net liability. Our funding of these plans is 
consistent with the local requirements in the 
countries where we operate. 
Since the pension liability is adjusted to the 
salary increase percentage of each country the 
plan belongs to, the pension plan is exposed to 
each country's inflation, interest rate risks, and 
changes in pensioner life expectancy. As the 
plan assets include significant investments in 
cash, cash equivalents, and government bonds, 
Nexperia is also exposed to interest rate risks 
arising in the jurisdictions that the investments 
relate to.

In addition to the defined benefit plans related to 
pensions, we granted one closed defined benefit 
plan related to post-retirement medical benefits 
to employees in the UK. In this plan, eligible retired 
individuals make their own arrangements with a 
designated private health insurer and then claim an 
annual subsidy back from Nexperia.
Our obligations are subject to demographic 
and economic risks. Economic risks are primarily 
unforeseen developments in goods and capital 
markets. The defined benefit plan is exposed to 
UK’s inflation, interest risk, and changes in the life 
expectancy for pensioners.

General Manager  
BG Leader IC Solutions
“At Nexperia, we are dedicated to empowering women in 
their pursuit of careers in technology.  
Women naturally connect more with daily life duties.  
Their thoughts and inputs tend to link to how products  
raise people’s living standards. Looking at things with  
different angles will help our products and services  
reach a broader audience. In a corporate world, women  
statistically show stronger desire to communicate and  
to resolve conflict. This brings in efficiency in corporate  
management. Tech sectors are largely operated in  
multinational manner. Communication plays a vital role.  
Women tends to over-estimate the challenges in having  
a career in tech sector. As a leader in sector, I believe in  
training and coaching early. As early as early childhood  
to plant a seed by offering creative thinking toys. I also  
believe in continuous mentorship program in corporate  
to cultivate technical and business leadership. This  
applies to both female and male leaders.”

Attracting young talents: our corporate trainee and 
apprenticeship programs
Our corporate trainee programs are a key part of our efforts to attract and 
retain young talent. These programs offer valuable learning opportunities and 
promote a culture of mentorship and growth within our company, in line with 
our commitment to attracting, supporting, and retaining top talent.
Nexperia has strong young talent programs at each of its major manufacturing 
sites to recruit and develop future leaders. In 2023, our programs in Germany, 
the UK, China, Malaysia, and the Philippines recruited and developed 78 
graduates, with program durations ranging from 9 to 36 months. Over 90% of 
participants were offered permanent contracts upon completion.
In Action
At Nexperia Germany, five students attended a dual 
study program in 2023. This program integrates 
academic studies at a university with practical 
on-the-job training in our company. Participants 
alternate between classroom learning and work 
experience, gaining both theoretical knowledge and 
practical skills relevant to their field of study. This 
approach allows students to earn a degree while 
gaining valuable work experience, often leading to 
excellent career prospects and smoother transitions 
into the workforce after graduation. 
In Germany, our apprenticeship program allows us 
to invest in the next generation of young people to 
become skilled professionals. The dual education 
system combines theoretical knowledge at schools 
with practical, hands-on experience in companies. 
Throughout the apprenticeship, participants alternate 
between periods of work in the Company and attending 
vocational school, allowing them to acquire both 
technical expertise and practical skills. They enter the 
Company directly after completing their training and 
embark on a qualified career in their chosen field.

In Malaysia, our NextGEM program 
is a 12-month initiative for young 
talent. Participants follow a structured 
onboarding and job rotation plan, with 
new rotations every four months. They 
receive training, participate in quarterly HR 
development talks, undergo assessments, 
and receive mid-year and final reviews. 
Upon completion, NextGEM participants 
attend a graduation day where awards are 
presented for the top NexGEM and mentor.
Our Fresh Grad Development Program 
in China helps young graduates 
to quickly learn and improve their 
skills in a 15-month training plan at 
Nexperia. It consists of four stages, 
including unified company onboarding 
training, departmental on-the-job 
training with mentors, job rotation 
training (optional), challenging small 
project assignments to enhance their 
own abilities and skills.
In the Philippines, our nine-month Cadetship 
program aims to identify and develop high-
potential talent. Young leaders are trained to 
advance horizontally and vertically within two 
years. The training roadmap comprises five phases, 
covering our culture, business processes, process 
familiarization, work immersion, and a project 
presentation. It combines theoretical and practical 
knowledge with technical and behavioral training 
objectives. Our cadets can choose between a line 
management or technical career path.

ONBOARDING
When new employees join our company, 
they can also join a selection of internal 
communities. These include event 
teams, TeamNexperia Young for emerging 
talents, community, charity, and sports 
committees, and technical communities 
exploring complex technical topics. These 
communities help our employees build 
stronger bonds and friendships with 
colleagues they may not have met otherwise.
In several countries, we also have a “buddy 
system” to help new employees embrace our 
organizational culture and values. During 
their onboarding process, new hires receive 
a welcoming gift and are assigned a buddy 
– typically an experienced employee – who 
provides advice on policies, procedures, 
and work rules while helping the new team 
member socialize. We also evaluate this 
onboarding process using an electronic 
feedback form sent to the new employee after 
a few months at Nexperia.  
95
SOCIAL REPORTINGnexperia | Sustainability Report 2023 Talent Attraction and Retention

Page 96:
To ensure we continually attract high-level talent, we 
maintain close connections with local talent pools during 
our recruitment and hiring processes. Members of our 
Talent Acquisition team stay in contact with promising 
candidates to re-engage in talks when new positions 
become available. This approach demonstrates our 
commitment to building long-term relationships, not only 
with new colleagues but also with students or potential 
hires. As a result, we have many examples of students 
joining our company as interns and staying on for a 
successful career. We also invest in employee engagement 
initiatives and host challenges and events (such as our 
Technical Forum, an internal innovation summit) to help 
our workforce remain creative, inspired, and connected.
EMPLOYER BRANDING CAMPAIGN
To communicate our company strengths and initiatives 
more transparently, we continue promoting our employer 
branding campaign, “Be part of something Bigger.” 
We believe TeamNexperia’s  proactive involvement in 
employee testimonials and social media campaigns 
creates a more authentic picture of who we are and what 
we value as a company. In addition, our employer branding 
campaign focuses on several important topics, such as 
women in engineering, the onboarding experiences of new 
talents, and the value of building communities. In 2023, 
Nexperia was present at numerous campus recruitment 
events and sponsored several initiatives aiming to attract 
talents and raise brand awareness.  
HOW WE REWARD REFERRALS – 
REFERRAL PROGRAM & CAMPAIGN
As a global company that values the 
diversity of our workforce, we encourage 
our employees to use their professional 
networks and refer suitable candidates for 
open positions. This way, our employees can 
help identify potential hires who have the 
right skills, qualifications, and cultural fit 
for TeamNexperia and can contribute to our 
growth goals.
We have two referral programs: 
TalentMagnet and the Global Referral 
Program.
Our TalentMagnet program rewards 
employees with gifts for each successful 
referral, i.e., each candidate who reaches the 
interview stage. The value of the gifts varies 
based on the number of successful referrals 
made by the employee. 
In addition, if a referred colleague is hired 
into a Nexperia position, the referring 
employee is eligible for a payment of €2,000. 
This bonus is paid in the local currency 
through regular payroll cycles and is subject 
to local tax laws.
In 2023, our employees recommended 716 
new candidates, 175 of whom reached the 
interview stage, leading to 122 hires.

Talent Development
As Nexperia’s success depends on our people and their abilities, 
it is critical to continually learn and grow together to sustainably 
achieve our corporate objectives. To this end, our talent 
development has three specific pillars:

Relevant GRI 
Standards:

Develop robust talent pipelines 
to stimulate our future growth
Build the right teams to achieve 
our strategic goals
Inspire our people to grow and

These pillars guide our efforts and help 
streamline our development actions. 
Importantly, we strive to achieve and maintain 
all three at the same time – a sophisticated 
balancing act for our leaders and HR experts.

Talent to realize our strategic ambitions Mutual responsibility and  
calibrated assessments
We take a shared approach to aligning our company 
ambitions, contribution requirements per position, and 
individual performance. As part of this approach, we expect 
our employees to seek clarity and feedback to improve their 
performance and our managers to actively provide clarity 
and constructive feedback. We encourage our employees 
and managers to make this a continuous dialogue, which we 
augment with a formal appraisal once a year. Throughout the 
year, our HR environment Workday enables both employees 
and managers to request direct feedback from any person 
at any moment. To ensure this dialogue remains honest and 
open, constructive feedback from employees must never 
result in personal consequences. Employees can also use our 
SpeakUp Line to give feedback anonymously. This reporting 
tool is described in more detail in the “Business Integrity and 
Ethics” chapter of this report.
To maintain consistency and fairness, our appraisals and 
feedback undergo a calibration cycle before they are 
finalized and discussed with the employee. 
Since Nexperia’s foundation in 2017, 
we have focused our performance 
management approach on both “results” 
and “behavior” to reinforce that what 
we achieve is just as important as 
how we achieve it. As a result, during 
our annual review cycle, we evaluate 
indirect employees on both their impact 
and behavior. Indirect employees do 
not work on the product directly, but 
for the overall business. All managers 
receive a one-hour training session 
in preparation for the performance 
management process. Performance 
review calibrations - in which managers 
discuss their proposed reviews with 
other managers – provide an additional 
fail-safe to ensure fairness, objectivity, 
and consistency.
For our direct employees working 
as operators in manufacturing sites, 
we have our own performance 
management system in place, which 
differs from country to country and is 
locally managed by HR. For example, in 
Hamburg and Manchester, we conduct 
annual performance appraisals with 
employees, typically 12 months after 
they join Nexperia and at further review 
intervals. In Seremban, Cabuyao, and 
Dongguan, every operator has a monthly 
KPI – including output, quality, yield, and 
personal behavior – determining their 
end-of-year performance rating and 
incentive payment. All newly hired direct 
labor employees receive a complete 
orientation one or two days before 
reporting to their workstation, covering 
Nexperia's policies, EHS awareness, and 
quality mindset.  
“Our success depends on our people. 
Growing our people to their full potential 
creates a strong, robust internal talent 
pipeline and makes Nexperia an exciting 
place to develop a career.”

Goal setting in 2023:  
embedding our strategic plans
In 2023, we focused on the direct 
connection and translation of strategic 
plans to individual goals. We have 
also implemented the concept of 
“organizational goals” in Workday to 
reflect our strategic objectives. These 
measures allow individuals to explicitly 
plan their contributions, connect 
them to their overarching department 
plans, and then deploy these plans to 
the people needed to achieve them. 
Additionally, in recognition of the 
growing interdependencies between 
our departments, we enable employees 
to explicitly link their personal goals with 
their department’s goals and those of 
any other departments they work for. 
For example, a quality leader may report 
to the quality organization but also work 
for a specific business group. In this case, 
they would link their personal goals to 
the goals of both departments. We also 
introduced a feedback appraisal system 
in our performance review process. 
The aim is to provide comprehensive 
and balanced feedback on individual 
contributions. Employees are 
encouraged to actively seek feedback 
from a broader range of stakeholders, 
including project managers and "dotted 
line managers," who oversee employees' 
assignments without being their direct 
line managers. 
In 2023, 86% of employee goals were 
linked to department goals. While goal 
setting has always been a part of our 
process, we aim to increase our impact 
by setting goals that are inclusive and 
actively monitor progress throughout 
the year, rather than reflecting on 
them at the end of the year. This 
explicit connection to organizational 
goals brings individual performance 
management and business performance 
management closer together.
To support this important step toward 
achieving our common aim as a 
company, we offered briefing sessions 
to all employees to elaborate on 
strategic planning, goal setting, and 
performance management. In 2024, 
we will further define our department 
goals using the Nexperia Management 
Model and Deep Dive approach. Our 
senior management teams are currently 
working on defining the exact goals, 
KPIs, and action plans to help us achieve 
our strategic ambition. 
To ensure we use goals to promote 
development and improve performance 
– rather than assessing performance 
after the fact – we request quarterly 
reviews throughout the year. In addition, 
we are exploring other ways to include 
forward-looking assessments in these 
quarterly reviews to increase our focus 
on development.

Utilizing the “70-20-10” model
We believe mastery of a subject is 
achieved through a combination 
of formal knowledge, practice, and 
feedback – commonly known as the “70-
20-10” model. Within this approach, 70% 
of all learning comes from practicing 
in a relevant context, 20% comes from 
receiving active coaching and feedback, 
and the remaining 10% - often in the 
form of behavioral change - comes 
from formal learning. At Nexperia, our 
development support focuses primarily 
on the 20 and 10 by encouraging 
feedback from managers and peers and 
making formal learning available. 
Traditionally, our formal learning 
content has been developed by 
individual departments or countries. 
This approach has yielded a relatively 
scattered learning landscape 
with inconsistent quality and 
availability. Since 2022, we have invested 
in our learning platform “Nexperia 
Academy.” It allows us to combine all 
our learning functions into a single, 
user-friendly database. It also enables us 
to manage our learning asset portfolio 
more effectively and includes suggested 
learning and knowledge-sharing features 
to enhance our development practices. 
Our learning approach increasingly 
uses “blended” learning and features 
“performance support,” in which 
relevant information is presented or can 
be accessed in small sections to improve 
engagement and knowledge retention. 
Since we introduced this learning 
platform, 598 courses have been logged 
in the system. Forty-five power users – or 
“administrators” – manage the courses, 
and we recorded 2,649 active users in 
a single month. Due to high levels of 
demand and usage, Nexperia Academy 
will focus on strengthening the role 
of our power users in 2024. We will 
offer administration training, covering 
topics such as enrolment notification 
and reporting, to enable them to fulfill 
their role more effectively. Additionally, 
further e-learning training will enhance 
our learning content and standardize 
branding across learning formats. 
The goal for Nexperia Academy is to 
constantly attract our employees to 
upskill and reskill at anytime, anywhere.

Professional development 
and coaching
To address our growing need for expert 
coaching in a range of development areas, 
we are piloting a coaching service with a 
professional coaching brokerage platform. 
This service provides the capacity to help 
specify development needs and connects 
our teams with coaches from a network of 
over 3,000 certified members. The service 
also includes formal evaluations and trend 
reporting to help us identify and address 
common development challenges. 
From a managerial perspective, we assess

development pathways help us mitigate 
talent availability risks, enhance our culture, 
and create an attractive proposition to 
retain and attract top talent. 
We explicitly plan successions for key 
positions, especially those that are 
difficult to replace. At present, 44% of 
our leadership positions have a succession 
plan, and by 2024, we aim to have 60% 
with strong, validated plans. For leadership 
positions without strong plans, and 
which have moderate or high retention 
risk and medium or high loss impact (i.e., 
replaceability), we maintain an external 
succession list to mitigate retention risk. 
To fill important positions with internal 
candidates more effectively, we are actively 
building and maintaining succession pools, 
starting with the categories “Product line 
General Managers” and “Critical technology 
experts.”
Promotions at Nexperia 
Our HR business partners work closely with their business 
counterparts to support the career growth and development 
of their teams. Once a year, all promotion nominations 
are reviewed by our Management Team and HR business 
partners. This cadence ensures our talents have the 
opportunity to grow into more advanced positions and can 
help drive Nexperia's continued business success. 
In 2023, we advanced 5.6% of our team members through 
internal promotions.
Promoting women into leadership position is also a key 
focus. We are currently working to implement and further 
intensify initiatives to support the successful career 
development of female managers (see the “Diversity, Non-
Discrimination, and Inclusion” chapter of this report).

The Nexperia Talent Program
Talent development remains one of Nexperia’s 
key priorities. The Global Talent Programs 
are integral to our people development and 
retention strategy, designed to engage, 
develop, and retain our high-potential 
talents. In 2024, Nexperia will continue offering 
four signature programs, each targeted at 
a different job level: Key Young Talent for 
graduates, Connections group for individual 
contributors, Emerging Leadership for people 
managers, and Nexperia Leadership for 
director-level employees. These intensive 
programs aim to accelerate the leadership 
skills and readiness of our talents in line with 
company growth. We select participants based 
on their leadership potential within Nexperia, 
and the curriculum is designed to foster their 
development as current and future leaders 
and catalysts for innovation and growth. This 
is achieved using the Nexperia Management 
model, which will help us to reach our mission 
and 2030 goal. 
We ensure that every cohort has strong 
talent earmarked as successors or with clear 
potential as successors and balance the groups 
in terms of department, country, and gender 
representation. The program runs over a 
six-month period in both Europe and Asia, 
utilizing our site facilities. During this time, our 
talents have multiple opportunities to work on 
business and personal leadership objectives, 
and to model Nexperia’s best practices, culture, 
and values.

Our career ladder 
Traditional job evaluation typically attributes the 
impact of subordinates to managerial positions. As a 
result, higher-level positions tend to be managerial. 
People looking to advance their careers often need 
to add managerial accountability to the point where 
they must relinquish their expert activities to focus 
on managing other experts. At Nexperia, we believe 
top-level experts can bring value to the Company that 
equals or even far exceeds that of their managers. 
Additionally, we wish to encourage our employees 
to progress in the direction that brings them the 
most professional and personal satisfaction. For 
these reasons, we have adopted a ladder approach, 
which recognizes expert careers alongside “regular” 
managerial careers. The ladders chart a clear path from 
an individual’s first role at Nexperia to advancing to the 
highest levels of achievement within the Company.
In our employee survey, detailed in the “Talent 
Attraction and Retention” chapter, we measure 
the extent to which our people experience growth 
opportunities.

Development goals, strengths, 
and opportunities
To reinforce our commitment to developing 
our employees as professionals - both in 
their existing roles and future careers - we 
ask them to define personal development 
goals along with performance goals. 
In our reviews, we broaden our official 
feedback beyond reviewing and supporting 
their progress toward development 
goals to include general strengths and 
opportunities. 
To further support personal and leadership 
development as well as well-being, the 
Nexperia Academy is available to all 
employees and offers an extensive library 
of course materials. A dedicated “career” 
section in our Workday app also helps 
employees find internal opportunities and

Diversity,  
Non-Discrimination,

Overview and  
management approach
At Nexperia, having “the right team” means 
embracing a diverse range of people, perspectives, 
and cultures. As a global company powered by 
innovation, we aim to foster inclusive working 
environments where all people can be authentic, 
develop professionally and personally, and work 
together to achieve common goals. 
Nexperia is a proud global community of talented 
professionals. As an equal-opportunity employer, 
we are committed to providing a diverse, fair, and 
inclusive working environment for all employees. 
By uniting various backgrounds, cultures, and 
skill sets, we gain a wealth of perspectives that 
stimulate creativity and enrich our corporate 
culture. Embracing diversity also means learning 
from different voices and opinions, finding new 
connections and similarities, and forming strong 
collaborations to develop new solutions. 
We are committed to a working environment 
where ethics, integrity, and trustworthiness 
are valued and shared, not only internally but 
among all stakeholders and the communities 
where we live and work. Therefore, we do not 
tolerate any form of inhumane treatment such 
as harassment, bullying, public shaming, verbal 
abuse, or discrimination based on factors such 
as race, nationality, skin color, gender, religion, 
age, pregnancy, health, sexual orientation, socio-
economic background, physical or mental ability, or 
political affiliation.

Program
To strengthen our commitment to 
diversity and inclusion (D&I), we 
launched an official D&I strategy in 2023. 
It comprises three main goals: 
To achieve these goals, we developed a 
four-pillared approach based on:
1. Maintaining inclusive, diverse, and 
fair hiring practices
2. Empowering leaders to champion 
D&I within their teams
3. Supporting pay equality
4. Fostering an inclusive culture and 
activating D&I ambassadors
We support these pillars with 
comprehensive communication 
measures as the foundation of our D&I 
strategy.
We manage the material topic of 
“Diversity, non-discrimination, and 
inclusion” using the same structures 
outlined in the “People Management 
at Nexperia” chapter. Our new D&I 
Program is coordinated by our Head of 
Talent Acquisition, who represents our 
senior HR management and reports 
directly to our Chief Human Resources 
Officer (CHRO). Our D&I strategy 
combines global governance and 
subject matter expertise with localized 
activation, allowing us to balance a 
holistic approach with the needs of each 
Nexperia location.
The topic of “Diversity, non-
discrimination, and inclusion” is also 
within the management scope of our 
Compliance Department and Ethics 
Committee (EC). The EC comprises our 
Chief Operating Officer (COO), Human 
Resources Director, Senior Director 
Legal, and Head of Global Audit. The 
EC meets at least once a quarter and 
advises our EMT on defining and 
enforcing our Code of Conduct. It is 
also responsible for ensuring accurate 
recordings of any misconduct allegations 
and coordinating appropriate follow-up 
actions.

Senior Director, Global Head of HR, Technology and Operations
“I am proud to work for a company that cares about 
gender diversity in leadership positions.
As an HR professional and a mother, I do believe 
that women leaders are critical to the success of 
our company, by bringing different perspectives 
and experiences that enable more creativity, 
support diversity of thoughts in problem solving and 
ultimately drive better solutions. By encouraging and 
supporting women in leadership positions, we will 
foster a more diverse and inclusive workplace, which 
is needed in the high-tech industry. 
I am also excited to be part of Nexperia’s Global 
Women Initiative group to help support women’s 
development, coaching and mentoring. By building 
a strong network and sharing best practices, women 
at all levels of leadership can gain experience and 
confidence in reaching one’s full potential and make 
a stronger impact on our company.”

We have developed our holistic D&I 
strategy to go beyond our existing 
decentralized approach. In addition 
to increasing underrepresented 
demographics, we focus on topics 
including psychological safety, 
awareness, and broadening our culture 
of acceptance.
To further embed anti-discrimination, 
diversity, and inclusion into our 
company DNA, we have adopted 
internal procedures and guidelines 
that reinforce our values. We mirror 
these expectations in our Sustainability 
Policy and standards of behavior and 
etiquette in our Code of Conduct. 
Through these guiding principles, we 
want all employees to enjoy a safe, 
open, and equitable workplace and feel 
confident reporting any infringements 
on their rights. When incidents do 
occur, we ensure all employees 
can discretely report all forms of 
discrimination and communicate with 
management without fear of reprisal, 
intimidation, or harassment. To achieve 
this aim, all Nexperia employees are 
encouraged to “speak up” and report 
any incidents of discrimination via our 
external whistleblowing platform, the 
SpeakUp Line, where they can leave 
an anonymous message, contact their 
local Ethics Liaison Officer, or address 
incidents directly with their manager. 
Our SpeakUp Line is described in more 
detail in the chapter “Business Integrity 
and Ethics” and our Whistleblowing 
Policy.
Additionally, the programs we use to 
monitor labor and human rights at 
Nexperia and across our supply chain 
(described in the chapter “Responsible 
Sourcing and Supplier Engagement”) 
also include the topics of diversity and 
non-discrimination. These programs 
include our Social Responsibility 
Auditable Standard Policy and due 
diligence procedures that accompany 
our RBA membership, including RBA 
Self-Assessments.
Our approach:  
ensuring equal opportunity  
for all
Our global workforce is diverse in professional 
discipline, nationality, gender, race, culture, 
ethnicity, language, age, religion, and sexual 
orientation. We embrace this variety, as 
demonstrated in our EMT and Senior Management 
teams which feature diverse genders, nationalities, 
and age groups.

Tomas Sheppard
Talent Acquisition Manager
“Diversity & Inclusion is a vital topic for a global company 
like Nexperia. D&I in the workplace can help create 
an environment where all employees feel equally 
involved, supported and represented without having to 
conform or change who they are to fit in and succeed. 
When employees feel comfortable and appreciated in 
the workplace they have an increased ability to share 
more openly, drive innovation and challenge the status 
quo with their diversified thoughts and ideas. This 
environment ultimately increases employee satisfaction, 
retention and confidence in creativity enabling us to 
seize new opportunities and grow together.   
Everybody performs best when they can proudly be 
themselves at work. Having a PRIDE Network in a large 
organisation such as Nexperia is important as it can 
provide a safe space for LGBTQ+ employees and allies to 
connect on important topics whilst sharing advice when 
needed. The Network acts as a community for LGBTQ+ 
employees to connect and work toward growing a 
support network for those who may need it.”

Page 113:
Targets, data development, and KPIs
The topics of diversity, equality, and anti-discrimination 
all include fair pay. To ensure our compliance, we 
maintain a pay philosophy based on fair pay principles, 
covering base pay, short-term, and long-term elements. 
Additionally, we use third-party data to compare our 
wages and salaries against industry benchmarks. 
We determine our remuneration and any associated 
individual changes based on objective criteria, regardless 
of gender. We aim to balance global and local incentives 
with our remuneration levels, supported by stringent 
checks and safeguards.
As part of our Nexperia D&I strategy, we aim to eliminate 
any possible gender pay gap. We also understand 
that gender pay equality cannot be achieved through 
policies and guidelines alone. The actions we are taking 
encompass promoting pay equity and improving gender 
representation across all levels of our company. To 
support pay equity, we have introduced a new talent 
review model and merit matrix system to further 
objectify our performance measurement and changes to 
individual remuneration. 
Improving gender representation across all levels of 
our company is an important step in achieving gender 
pay equality. One of the challenges we are actively 
addressing is the low percentage of female workers in 
the semiconductor industry. We continuously benchmark 
the external talent market to identify opportunities to 
correct the gender representation imbalance. Currently, 
40.75% of our global employees are women. 
Correcting the imbalance in gender pay equality 
includes focusing on the number of women in senior 
management positions. Many of these are engineering 
roles, where the percentage of women in the talent pool 
is significantly lower than in other fields. At the same 
time, this challenge also presents new opportunities. 
As part of our Nexperia D&I strategy, we have set clear 
targets to increase the percentage of women in our 
leadership and engineering roles. 
HIGHLIGHT: NEXPERIA CELEBRATES 
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN IN ENGINEERING 
DAY 
TeamNexperia values and recognizes the strong women in 
our engineering teams. To support International Women in 
Engineering Day, we share the stories of female engineers at 
Nexperia, celebrate their achievements, and encourage new 
generations of women to take up careers in engineering. In 2023, 
we shared stories internally and externally, covering why they love 
what they do and how they entered the field of engineering.
PROMOTING CULTURAL AWARENESS
We create opportunities to learn about the different people and 
cultures at Nexperia through internal and external channels, 
such as our employee newsletter, X.press, and social media 
accounts. These initiatives - combined with our employer branding 
campaigns and accompanying materials - celebrate D&I while 
raising cultural awareness. As part of this approach, we use video, 
photography, and other content to show the diversity of our 
workforce (across backgrounds, positions, and locations), allowing 
individuals to share their unique stories and perspectives. 
Diversity and inclusion campaigns

SOCIAL REPORTINGnexperia | Sustainability Report 2023Diversity, Non-Discrimination, and Inclusion

Diversity and inclusion campaigns
We are committed to achieving a minimum of 30% 
women leaders by 2030. This target is reaffirmed in our 
social KPI, stipulated by Nexperia's first Sustainability-
Linked Loan (see chapter “ESG Risk Rating”). In addition, 
we are committed to increasing the percentage of 
women in R&D and engineering to 20% by 2030. To reach 
these concrete targets, we have developed a holistic 
approach for 2024 and beyond, including a dedicated 
female leadership program and Women in Nexperia 
Employee Resource Group. We are also exploring targets 
on geographical representation, generation, and age 
cohorts. With 25.1% women in management positions 
in 2023, we were able to increase the number of female 
leaders from 24.1% in 2022, and from 17.6% (2022) to 
18.6% in 2023 for women in R&D and engineering.
We believe these goals also need to be reflected at 
our highest levels of management. In 2023, we had a  
8.3% share of women in our EMT and aim to continue 
increasing gender diversity in our EMT until 2030.

the world. We will continue these efforts in 2024, extending their 
reach globally and including more internal channels.

Nexperia’s commitment to human rights
Since our foundation in 2017, we have been dedicated to 
protecting human and labor rights. We publicly reinforced this 
commitment by signing the UN Global Compact and supporting 
the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 
17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our priorities and 
protocols in this area are detailed in our company-wide Code of 
Conduct, Sustainability Policy, and Policy Statement on human 
rights and environment-related due diligence obligations 
(applicable to Nexperia Germany GmbH). We have aligned these 
documents with leading international human and labor rights 
frameworks such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
(UDHR), the ILO Labor Standards, the UN Guiding Principles 
on Business and Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for 
Multinational Enterprises, and the SDGs.
Overview and management approach
Around the world, companies play a vital 
role in implementing and respecting 
labor and human rights. As a global 
organization, Nexperia understands 
that labor and human rights are some 
of our most important topics, both 
within our own company and our 
partners across our supply chain. We 
embrace the responsibility to uphold 
human rights, prevent violations, and 
safeguard people and the environment. 
We also strive to make sustainability 
and social responsibility part of our daily 
work (more details in the “Responsible 
Sourcing and Supplier Engagement” 
chapter). Overseen by our general HR 
Management and our new Human Rights 
Office and Compliance management 
structures, our programs aim to ensure 
we treat all people with respect and 
dignity.
We have formalized this approach in 
several concrete policies that guide 
our processes. For example, the Social 
Responsibility Auditable Standard covers 
our employees and members of our 
supply chain. It details our commitment 
to a transparent and safe workplace 
and supply chain, including standards 
for human rights, equal pay, non-
discrimination measures, training, and 
more. By committing to this standard, 
we are also more closely aligned with 
the International Labor Organization 
(ILO) standards. These efforts are also 
reflected in our Code of Conduct and 
Sustainability Policy.
The Code of Conduct stipulates that 
our remuneration is consistent with the 
provisions of all applicable wage laws, 
including those relating to minimum 
wage, overtime hours, and legally 
mandated benefits. We also enforce a 
strict working hours policy in compliance 
with local laws and guarantee all 
Nexperia employees the right to 
collective bargaining.
Our Sustainability Policy commits us to 
maintain an open and ongoing dialogue 
with our employees and workers’ 
representatives. As transparency is a 
vital topic for our employees, we take 
steps such as adhering to minimum 
notice periods for relevant working 
changes and including our employees 
in important company decisions. In 
addition to these measures, the workers’ 
councils at our sites work closely 
with Nexperia management teams to 
create and maintain positive working 
environments for all employees.
OUR COMMITMENT TO  
PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS 
In 2023 and early 2024, Nexperia Germany 
implemented several measures to comply with the 
German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act. They included 
appointing a Human Rights Office and publishing a 
Policy Statement on human rights and environment-
related due diligence obligations. This document 
defines the steps and measures we take to identify, 
prevent, and mitigate potential human rights abuses 
across our business activities.

Remedy and grievance mechanisms
Any violations of human rights or other 
topics covered in our Code of Conduct can

Relevance of human rights
According to the UDHR, human rights are 
fundamental rights that every individual 
possesses from the moment they are born. 
These include the right to dignity and liberty, 
as well as fair and equal treatment. Nexperia is 
committed to protecting and promoting these 
rights while contributing to the betterment of 
society. 
Implementation within our organization
We implement our measures, processes, and 
policies relating to human and labor rights 
based on our Social Responsibility Management 
System. It includes policies, standards, and 
procedures such as our Code of Conduct, 
Supplier Code of Conduct, Sustainability Policy, 
and Social Responsibility Auditable Standard. 
Since joining the Responsible Business Alliance 
(RBA) in June 2017, we have also aligned our 
Social Responsibility Management System with 
the provisions of the RBA Code of Conduct.
Our newly established Human Rights Office 
(HRO) is tasked with further developing 
Nexperia's human rights strategy and 
measures. The Human Rights Office consist of 
our Director Legal and Head of Sustainability. 
Human rights due diligence
We employ a human rights due diligence 
approach to mitigate any unfair treatment 
or harm to individuals. It comprises five key 
elements:
1. Assessment to identify and prioritize risks
› At our manufacturing sites, we conduct 
regular RBA self-assessments and internal 
audits for labor, human rights, and social 
responsibility compliance according to the 
RBA’s Validated Assessment Program (VAP).
› For our suppliers, we conduct annual risk 
assessments and, based on the results, 
perform social responsibility audits (see

Overview and  
management approach
The health and safety of our employees 
is our highest priority. We continually 
work to ensure that everyone at 
Nexperia – our employees, temporary 
workers, interns, partners, and visitors – 
feels safe in a secure environment. Our 
focus encompasses medical, physical, 
and emotional or mental health. In our 
Code of Conduct and Sustainability 
Policy, we commit to providing healthy 
and safe working conditions to protect 
people from harm, promote all forms 
of health, and foster a positive work-life 
balance.
In keeping with these aims, we assure 
a very high standard of occupational 
safety, which is integral to our 
operations. We systematically rate 
all workplaces with risk assessment 
procedures and ensure we have the 
necessary health and safety measures 
for all positions. Taking the hierarchy 
of controls into account, we take 
measures in the following order to be 
most effective: elimination, substitution, 
engineering controls, signage and 
warnings and/or administrative controls, 
and personal protective equipment. 
We monitor, follow-up, and report cases 
that resulted in first aid, restricted 
workdays, medical treatment beyond 
first aid, lost workdays, and fatalities. 
We enforce mandatory safety 
training for all employees before 
they commence work and base all 
our safety training and activities 
on local risk assessments. Through 
these actions, we follow our 
corporate health and safety 
philosophy of “Vision ZERO.” This 
prevention approach integrates 
the three dimensions of safety, 
health, and well-being at all levels 
of our work. 
Along with our internal policies, 
we promote safety through our 
membership in the European 
Semiconductor Industry Association 
(ESIA). Every year, we provide ESIA 
with safety data from our European 
manufacturing sites, including the 
number of recordable cases, days away 
from work, working hours, FTEs, total 
case incident rate, severity rate, and 
other indicators.

Since Nexperia’s foundation, we 
have supported the well-being of our 
employees to ensure they feel secure, 
happy, and healthy at work. We organize 
various well-being and health-related 
services at our locations, including on-
site nursing and doctors, medical and 
healthcare events such as vaccinations 
and screenings, and healthcare services. 
More specific examples can be found 
later in this chapter.
Our Health and Safety (H&S) 
Management System is a component of 
our EHS Management System (detailed 
in the “Environmental Management 
at Nexperia” chapter), which is 
an integral part of our integrated 
Nexperia Management System. Our 
H&S Management System covers our 
headquarters and manufacturing 
sites and is certified to ISO 45001, 
the globally recognized Occupational 
Health & Safety Management Systems 
standard. Compliance with the 
requirements of the management 
system standard is verified through 
external audits by the certification body. 
We have also developed robust health 
and safety programs and initiatives 
to safeguard our team members, 
partners, contractors, and visitors. 
This approach ensures we follow our 
internal programs and results in the 
same way we follow all national and 
international laws and regulations. 
Our non-certified sites – primarily our 
offices – must still comply with minimum 
environmental and occupational health 
and safety requirements using the “EHS 
Management System Light” approach. 
We have converted this procedure into 
a checklist detailing the key issues these 
locations must evaluate. It also helps 
their responsible personnel check and 
document our compliance with laws 
relating to occupational health and 
safety and the environment.
In addition to audits and reviews required by the 
Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems 
standard (ISO 45001), we verify the effectiveness of our 
H&S Management System using our Social Responsibility 
Auditable Standard. We also perform self-assessments as 
part of our Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) membership. 
The standardized RBA self-assessment approach rates companies 
from 0 to 100 – with 100 being the highest. In 2023, Nexperia 
achieved a risk score of 90.4, equating to a low-risk assessment. 
Both our RBA membership and Social Responsibility Auditable 
Standard are described in more detail in the “Responsible 
Sourcing and Supplier Engagement” chapter.

Chemicals are essential in our 
manufacturing processes, development 
activities, and laboratories. We work 
with chemicals in a specialized manner, 
following our Chemicals Management 
System. To protect our employees 
and facilities, we have strict safety 
protocols based on risk assessment 
and management measures, including 
technical safety measures, clear 
procedures, and continual education and 
training. We also prioritize emergency 
response skills related to chemical 
management, such as conducting 
regular evacuation exercises and 
practicing for emergencies. Additionally, 
we require all our industrial sites to have 
employees with professional emergency 
skills, and our larger offices must 
have employees trained in emergency 
response.
Guided by our Management System 
and Vision ZERO, all employees must 
immediately report accidents, injuries, 
or any unsafe equipment, practices, or 
conditions to a supervisor or appropriate 
team member. These measures have 
yielded exceptional results: zero 
fatalities since our foundation and zero 
high-consequence work-related injuries. 
These data points include employees, 
temporary workers, and contractors. 
In 2023, we also recorded zero work-
related ill health incidents. 
Training on H&S
We define our various training courses in individual 
learning plans that apply to all employees. 
We provide our employees with information 
about their site, legislation, and responsibilities, 
combined with specific knowledge about safe 
work systems, clean room safety, working with 
chemicals, handling machinery, first aid, and 
emergency procedures. In addition, we frequently 
communicate all relevant health and safety topics 
and developments and reinforce security and 
safety. We provide all training and communication 
in an employee’s native language or another they 
can easily understand. For visitors and external 
parties working for or on behalf of Nexperia, we 
supply all relevant health and safety information, 
and some must also complete appropriate training 
before commencing work in our facilities.
As we manage health and safety using 
our EHS Management System and 
structure, the same organizational 
setup and positions described in 
the “Environmental Management 
at Nexperia” chapter apply to this 
material topic. At the site level and for 
specific health and safety matters, we 
position trained experts to supervise 
protective measures and create safe and 
ergonomically friendly workplaces. We 
also guarantee our employees access to 
occupational health care, which occurs 
either directly on-site or in a nearby 
contracted facility.
Nexperia’s Social Responsibility 
and certified EHS Management 
System include establishing 
a strong data collection base, 
consistent and standardized 
reporting from each manufacturing 
site, ongoing training, and internal 
and external audits. In addition, 
we guide our daily business using 
procedures from relevant health 
and safety topics, such as chemical 
spills, emergency response 
systems, pandemics, and more.

Ongoing COVID-19  
response management 
The COVID-19 pandemic persisted in 2023, 
although with notable improvements compared 
to previous years. Nevertheless, we continued 
maintaining a safe working environment while 
navigating the pandemic's unique challenges. 
At the beginning of the year, we saw only a 
limited number of cases that did not impact 
our operations. Despite this positive trend, we 
remained vigilant and equipped all employees 
at our manufacturing sites and offices with the 
necessary tools and protocols to prevent spreading 
the virus. Building on our experience from the 
initial outbreak in 2020, our crisis management 
team, supported by dedicated local teams, 
continued monitoring the local, national, and 
international COVID-19 risk landscapes. Our crisis 
management team ensures Nexperia complies with 
all remaining COVID-19 regulations.
We extended our working-from-home policies 
throughout 2023. They include providing the 
necessary IT infrastructure to facilitate digital 
collaboration and support e-learning opportunities 
for our employees. We will continue adapting to 
the situation as it evolves, prioritizing the safety 
and welfare of our employees while aligning with 
the most current guidelines and recommendations.
Our approach:  
safety in all situations
We work to eliminate all forms of hazards via 
regular audits, safety walks, and various open 
communication channels. Nevertheless, although 
they are rare, we acknowledge that health and 
safety incidents can still occur. Therefore, we 
study all cases – including near-misses and first-
aid requirements – to improve our management 
systems and better understand their causes 
and impacts. Additionally, we check for all 
possible high-potential events and monitor our 
preparedness.
At the same time, we also focus on our employees’ 
and temporary workers’ basic needs to maintain 
their health and safety according to occupational 
health and safety labor standards. For example, 
we provide suitable working conditions with ready 
access to clean toilet facilities, potable water, and 
sanitary food preparation and storage facilities. In 
addition, worker dormitories provided by Nexperia 
or a third party must be clean and safe, including 
emergency exits, adequate heating and ventilation, 
and reasonable personal space. 
We monitor and measure our health and safety 
performance using various data points and specific 
KPIs. We record and categorize all health and safety 
incidents via local data management software or 
collection. We report all incidents to the relevant 
authorities, including any contractor fatalities, of 
which there has never been a recorded incident.

A general assessment is also part of 
our Business Continuity Procedures. In 
our daily operations, the most common 
work-related incidents (in order of 
frequency) include falling and slipping, 
being struck by or against an object, 
and being cut by sharp edges or objects. 
To prevent high-consequence injuries, 
we focus on accidents such as possible 
exposure to fires, chemical burns, 
electric shocks, and toxic fumes. While 
we continually work to eliminate these 
high-impact risks, we also maintain 
attention on regular incidents to 
minimize all cases.
To manage risks, we perform 
comprehensive annual risk assessments 
at each site using the repetitive PDCA 
(Plan-Do-Check-Act) process. These 
assessments play a significant role 
in evaluating and maintaining the 
effectiveness of our management 
systems. We also empower our 
employees to prevent workplace 
hazards and incidents by providing 
several channels to report concerns or 
opportunities for improvement. They 
include our anonymous SpeakUp Line, 
which is described in more detail in our 
Code of Conduct and the “Business 
Integrity and Ethics” chapter. Employees 
can also report directly to their site’s 
Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) 
representative, participate in site-
level safety committees and councils, 
or use one of our official grievance 
mechanisms. In all cases of concern, we 
ask our employees to stop working and 
speak up immediately.
For 2023, we set a health and safety 
target to reduce our total case incident 
rate (TCIR) by 10% below the median of 
the past five years, equating to a rate 
of 0.18. Over the year, we achieved an 
average total case incident rate of 0.26 
across all sites, slightly higher than our 
goal. Most cases recorded were minor 
incidents in the categories of “fall or 
slip” or “being struck by/against/caught 
in, under, or between objects.”
We also compare our data with the 
European Semiconductor Industry 
Association, for which we were well 
below average over the last few years. 
In round numbers, we recorded 20 
lost workday cases (LWC) in 2023, an 
improvement compared to 25 in 2022. 
In addition to our KPIs, we measure 
and quantify our Severity Rate, which 
was 2.67 in 2023 and lower compared 
to 2022. Our individual sites often use 
further KPIs to measure their progress 
in specific focus areas or against internal 
targets.
We identify and assess potential 
risks and emergency situations and 
control them through appropriate 
design, engineering, administrative 
controls, preventive maintenance, 
safe work procedures, and ongoing 
safety training and drills. Our plans 
and procedures aim to minimize all 
harm to people, the environment, 
and property. We assess all health 
and safety risks as part of our ISO 
certification and our responsibility 
as an employer.

Projects
Across our global operations, we run various 
initiatives to support our employees, their families, 
and local communities. One popular example is 
our Employee Assistance Program (EAP), which 
provides online guidance on important issues, 
including health, finances, child care, elderly 
relatives, legal matters, and relationships. It also 
features other health-related courses, such as 
yoga and general fitness. While we engage with 
a range of suppliers in our EAP, our goal is to 
provide independent support that is easy for our 
employees to access. The EAP also includes online 
support and options to speak with an independent 
advisor if needed.
We also promote health and well-being at our 
locations by holding campaign events. For example, 
our site in Nijmegen (Netherlands) organizes a bi-
annual well-being week featuring various activities 
for the body and mind. In 2023, we offered 
mindfulness training, an anti-stress workshop, 
Pilates courses, instructions for ergonomic work 
posture, a dietician presentation, healthy lunches, 
various screen-off breaks such as puzzles, and 
much more.

Our health and well-being approach also incorporates 
preventative measures based on each site’s unique 
material issues. These include managing vaccinations 
for COVID-19 and yearly influenza waves. Our 
measures also encompass more general prevention 
management, such as at our Manchester (UK) site, 
where employees can access mental and physical 
health support and guidance through external 
providers.
We also enhance our first aid capabilities by training 
selected employees as mental health first aiders. At 
the same time, our primary focus is on maintaining 
a healthy work-life balance to avoid the stage where 
mental health first aid is necessary. For example, our 
Nijmegen (Netherlands) site offers employees various 
leisure activities such as table tennis and table soccer 
to encourage off-screen breaks. To support regular 
sports and movement, it also arranges weekly kick-
boxing group lessons. At Nexperia’s Hamburg site 
(Germany), the HR team organized a health day for 
employees in cooperation with a health insurance 
Nexperia monitors the total case incident rate (TCIR) as a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) 
for the effectiveness of its OHS Management System. Comparing Nexperia’s TCIR with ESIA’s 
TCIR, enables the evaluation of the maturity level of Nexperia’s OHS Management System. 
To improve the accuracy of Nexperia’s TCIR data, we reviewed and updated the historical 
records from 2017 to 2023 for all sites, using the Sustainability Tool 2.0. Previously, our 
sites reported lost workday cases (LWC) due to severity and resulting time away from work. 
Recognizing the importance of comprehensive reporting, we have now included restricted 
workday cases (RWC) and medical treatment cases (MTC) as per the Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration's (OSHA) TCIR criteria. This has led to the revision of historical data 
across all sites to reflect these additional categories.
IN ACTION
In Malaysia, our site in Seremban 
holds regular health talks 
throughout the year. Once a 
year, it organizes a health and 
safety fair where employees can 
learn and participate in different 
activities to raise health and safety 
awareness.

in Manchester (UK) also has a focus on these areas, 
managing cases with processes to help employees 
successfully return to work in cooperation with their 
line managers.
Health and safety are crucial components of our secure 
and sustainability-oriented business. Moving forward, 
we will continue to assess and improve our health and 
safety practices to meet the evolving needs of our 
stakeholders and the world around us.
Similar to the TCIR, Nexperia monitors the severity rate (SR) as a second indicator 
of the effectiveness of its OHS Management System.

We believe it is important to give back to the 
communities where we live and work. We do this 
by supporting various social and environmental 
initiatives and encouraging employees to take part 
in activities that benefit their communities. 
Throughout 2023, Nexperia and its employees 
took action at local, national, and international

personal development, we work 
to nurture the bright minds 
of tomorrow. The Hamburg 
team (Germany) hosted 40 
brilliant children for Kids’ 
Future Day 2023 in cooperation 
with the Micro:bit Educational 
Foundation. Working in small 
groups, the children could 
either build solar-powered 
catamarans and take part in a 
race or receive a crash course in 
computer programming. These 
family days at our sites are 
valuable opportunities to hone 
children’s curiosity and create 
fun environments that foster 
interest in technology.
SDG 4
Our employees’ mental and 
physical health is one of our highest 
priorities. Therefore, several of our 
sites offered awareness days or 
programs in 2023. For example, in 
May, our site in Seremban (Malaysia) 
held a health screening program 
for employees in collaboration with 
the LPPKN (National Population 
and Family Development Board), 
reaching 250 people. The screenings 
featured various indicator checks, 
including Body Mass Index (BMI) 
assessments and tests to evaluate 
stress, cholesterol, and glucose 
levels. 
Several other sites, such as 
Budapest, Nijmegen, and 
Manchester, organized health 
days or sporting events during the 
reporting year.

Keeping the environment clean is 
a major focus of TeamNexperia in 
Malaysia. Thirty employees from our 
Seremban site volunteered for a CSR 
beach cleaning day at Pantai Saujana. 
The beach is a 40-minute drive from our 
premises, and we organized the session 
in collaboration with Port Dickson 
City Council. In parallel, around 100 
employees from the Seremban site took 
part in a Hiking & Cleaning initiative, 
combining exercise with picking up litter 
for a cleaner natural environment. In 
Cabuyao (Philippines), our EHS Team 
organized a tree-planting event. Working 
with community volunteers, 22 Nexperia 
employees from our local management 
team and various departments planted 
over 150 hardwood seedlings provided 
by Nexperia. Their hard work will directly 
contribute to a greener and healthier 
local environment.
Diversity and inclusion
We believe embracing diversity, gender equality, and inclusion 
is fundamental to our growth as a company and as people. 
A recent milestone for Nexperia was the foundation of our 
LGBTQIA+ community by employees from around the world 
(see the chapter "Diversity, Non-discrimination and Inclusion" 
for more details). The community's first meeting was in 
November 2023 and aimed to stimulate diversity and inclusion at 
TeamNexperia.
With a similar goal, members of our Communications and 
Branding team initiated a pilot project on International Women’s 
Day. At our headquarters in Nijmegen (Netherlands), the 
team launched a discussion and networking event to amplify 
the conversation on equality and help women advance in the 
organization. We also promoted female empowerment on 
International Women in Engineering Day, sharing stories of our 
female engineers, celebrating their achievements, and hoping to 
inspire a new generation of young women to pursue careers in 
engineering.

Yuxing Special School. During their 
breaks, volunteers spend time with the 
children to play games, study, and try 
new food. Additionally, they planted 
flowers and plants to create a greener 
campus. Nexperia employees also 
engage in community actions such as 
providing companionship to elderly 
people and donating books and clothes 
to remote mountain towns and disaster 
areas.
Employees in Hamburg (Germany) 
donated €6,000 to the local children’s 
charity Dunkelziffer e.V. The charity, 
launched in 1993, offers therapy and 
support for children and young people 
affected by sexual violence. Nexperia’s 
Hamburg team generated its donation 
throughout the reporting year via a 
collection and recycling campaign 
for electronic and metal waste. Our 
employees were proud to contribute to 
the charity’s crucial work of providing 
young people and their families with 
emergency services, safe spaces for 
counseling, and legal support.
Nexperia also made direct financial 
contributions to important social and 
humanitarian causes. In 2023, we

and top management are crucial to 
ensuring it operates sustainably and in 
the best interests of its stakeholders. At 
Nexperia, we follow this approach with 
our Board and Executive Management

To manage daily business decisions and 
respond to urgent matters, the EMT (under 
the chairmanship of the CEO) is entrusted with 
the general management of the Company. This 
includes deploying Nexperia’s strategy and 
policies and achieving its objectives and results. 
In this function, the EMT oversees all operations 
and reviews the Group’s global business results, 
enabling it to make operational decisions and 
assess our overall performance. The individual 
members of our EMT are introduced in the “Our 
Executive Management Team” chapter.
The EMT, shown in the chart below, ensures we 
efficiently share business issues and practices 
across our organization. The managerial 
overview of sustainability through our EMT 
is described in detail in the “Our Approach to 
ESG” chapter. We have structured our EMT as 
a matrix organization with multiple layers of 
managerial accountability and responsibility. 
This approach allows us to maximize our focus 
on our customers and the market, leverage 
company resources, and achieve excellence in 
all our core processes and support functions. 
See chapter “Our EMT” for further information on 
Nexperia's Executive Management Team.
At the end of 2023, there were changes to our EMT. Dr. Ke Jiang, Toni Versluijs, and Mark 
Roeloffzen left Nexperia, and Philipp Obier joined the EMT as the new BG Leader Bipolar 
Discretes, while Fredrik Öberg joined as the new BG Leader MOS Discretes. Additionally, 
in early 2023, Ronald van Cleef passed away unexpectedly. Dirk Wittorf, VP Corporate 
Strategy & Chief of Staff, Strategy & Governance a.i., has since served as the interim Head 
of Strategy. At the start of 2024, Jean-Pierre Kempeneers joined Nexperia as Chief of 
Corporate Affairs, succeeding Charles Smit, who retired.

Our matrix organization has three main 
clusters:
› Business groups (BGs) that are the 
entities responsible for achieving 
business results.
› Core processes that build our core 
competencies and leverage the most 
effective ways of working to achieve 
our business goals in product creation, 
order fulfilment, and sales and 
marketing.
› Support functions for the BGs to 
achieve leadership positions in the 
market. These functions are HR, 
Corporate Development, Strategy, 
M&As, Finance, Corporate Affairs, 
Legal & IP (Intellectual Property), IT, 
Equipment and Automation (E&A), 
Master Data Management (MDM), 
Quality, and Sustainability. 
As of February 2024, Nexperia operates in four 
business groups: BG IC Solutions (ICS), BG MOS 
Discretes (MOS), BG Bipolar Discretes (BD), and BG

Key organizational principles and policies
All of Nexperia’s activities are 
essential to supporting our overall 
mission and strategy. Therefore, 
we have created an organizational 
structure comprising business 
groups and centrally led core 
and support processes. Nexperia 
is managed as a fully integrated 
business.
1. Key decisions are made by the 
EMT, which gives direction to the 
businesses, core, and support 
processes. 
2. We have a company culture and 
values led by our efficient and 
passionate team to support our 
mission and vision. 
3. Our strategy enables us to 
outline strategic directions and 
activities to further enhance 
Nexperia's competitive 
positioning and achieve its 
company objectives.
4. We have defined core processes 
(Product Creation, Order 
Fulfilment, and Sales and 
Marketing) and several support 
functions and processes.
NEXPERIA’S THREE  
STRATEGIC FOCUS AREAS
1. Innovation, primarily supported by increasing R&D spending
2. Enhancing efficiency and driving further cost reductions 
3. Growing our business in a sustainable and eco-friendly way
As part of this strategy, Nexperia aims to strengthen its 
position with technology- and industry-shaping customers 
by anticipating megatrend requirements in Electrification, 
Connectivity & Digitalization, Industry 4.0 and Automation, 
Sustainability and Energy, and Geopolitical specifics.

GOVERNANCE REPORTINGnexperia | Sustainability Report 2023Responsibility of Management

Our ambition to satisfy our customers and 
stakeholders relies on the continuous operation 
of our critical and vital processes. Therefore, our 
Business Continuity Management (BCM) acts 
as a catalyst to anticipate, plan for, and react to 
any disturbances to our critical and vital business 
processes. The BCM also defines appropriate 
measures and procedures to sustain our operations 
and enables us to proactively identify and mitigate 
risks. 
Each Nexperia site has identified the potential 
risks in their factory operations that can impact the 
supply of products to end customers. These risks 
include physical factory asset risks within front-
end and back-end operations, such as facilities 
systems, utility infrastructure (electricity, water, 
etc.), regional risks (natural hazards), or other 
supply risks (wafers, chemicals, gases). To maintain 
readiness, we review, audit, and update these risks 
periodically. 
We categorize each site based on our assessed 
risk and the size and magnitude of its operations. 
Then, for each of the three category tiers - with tier 
1 meaning significant disruption to our operation 
and tier 3 representing low risk - we submit a 
range of requirements. They include defining crisis 
teams and emergency plans, establishing processes 
to restore operations, and various degrees of 
monitoring, training, and other relevant actions.
The leadership of our core and support processes is 
responsible for:
› Providing business-enabling technologies, 
effective and efficient working methods, and 
training to ensure our competencies match our 
strategy and customer requirements.
› Determining the optimum balance between 
central and decentralized resourcing.
› Providing cross-unit support, coordination, and 
learning to leverage considerable company 
advantages in decentralized activities.
 
Driven by our Quality Policy, our quality 
commitments ensure: 
› We aim for zero customer incidents in our 
standard 
› We promote that everyone is responsible for 
quality
› We have recognized leadership in quality
› We maintain a company-wide focus on quality 
 
The EMT underpins our commitment to responsible 
corporate citizenship and our pursuit of a more 
sustainable future - economically, socially, and 
environmentally. To strengthen these efforts, the 
EMT rolled out a new Code of Conduct campaign 
in 2023. Our Code of Conduct details Nexperia’s 
core principles on integrity and ethics in business 
conduct and governance. It guides our business 
decisions and actions worldwide and applies 
equally to corporate actions and our employees’ 
behavior while conducting business. Further details 
can be found in the “Business Integrity and Ethics” 
chapter.

GOVERNANCE REPORTINGnexperia | Sustainability Report 2023Responsibility of Management

As an organization, we are committed to learning and 
continuous improvement. To support these aims, we 
established a comprehensive, group-wide approach 
focused on identifying and solving problems to deliver 
exceptional quality in all areas of our work. Our business 
review structure, improvement projects, and audits 
program form the core of this continuous improvement 
process. It enables our board and EMT to achieve steady 
business enhancement and identify and remediate 
negative impacts where possible.
As every issue that is not addressed could affect 
the quality of our products, we are committed to 
empowering our employees to actively participate 
in quality improvement. We prioritize employee 
development to ensure our team members can act as 
creative problem solvers and our managers as excellent 
mentors and coaches. Consequently, we see high levels 
of active engagement in our quality improvement across 
all teams. In addition, our EMT focuses on problem 
elimination rather than mere reduction, underscoring 
our commitment to understanding critical issues 
and enabling us to take more targeted and effective 
corrective actions. More information can be found in the 
“Talent Development” chapter.
We use a range of methods to identify areas of 
improvement, including audits (internal, external, 
and customer), complaints, customer feedback (Net 
Promoter Score), business review meetings, and 
improvements identified at the staff level. We then 
implement corrective and preventive actions at the 
necessary levels to reduce negative impacts. We support 
these activities using appropriate quality tools and 
conducting an employee survey every two years.
Overall, we believe effective governance and 
sustainability practices are critical to the long-term 
success of our company and stakeholders. Our EMT 
and top management play a crucial role in ensuring we 
operate sustainably and responsibly. Their performance 
– as well as that of Nexperia overall – reflects in our 
company’s valuation, which is assessed twice a year. The 
procedure also includes strategy planning, ensuring our 
systems and processes are relevant and we are ready 
to embrace new opportunities. Through these steps, 
we align our governance practices with our business 
strategy and sustainability values.
As a company, we are committed to upholding these 
principles and will continue integrating sustainability 
and good governance into all aspects of our operations. 
By establishing strong policies and practices, 
communicating transparently with stakeholders, and 
continuously improving our processes, Nexperia can 
create long-term value for all stakeholders.

Introduction and 
management approach
We are committed to conducting our 
business with integrity and complying with 
all applicable laws and regulations. We 
support these aims with robust policies 
and procedures that prevent corruption 
and promote ethical business practices 
across our operations and supply chain. 
We address all relevant business ethics 
risks using our ethical risk assessment 
procedures. In August 2023, we launched a 
global campaign titled “What’s your limit?” 
to promote our updated Code of Conduct 
and encourage our employees to speak up 
if they encounter any suspected violations. 
The launch included a letter from our CEO 
outlining the behavior, ethics, and values 
that underpin Nexperia's high standards for 
business conduct.
Overall, the Code of Conduct aims to foster 
a clear, strong, and consistent culture of 
ethics across our entire organization. It 
covers a broad range of sustainability and 
compliance topics and includes various 
other policies, such as anti-bribery and 
whistleblowing. 
Our Ethics Committee (EC) is operationally 
responsible for our ethics and compliance 
management. It comprises a dedicated 
team of executive leaders that ensures all 
employees, suppliers, and business partners 
understand and comply with our business 
ethics standards. The EC is responsible for 
governing and interpreting our Code of 
Conduct and ensuring it communicated 
and implemented effectively. It also 
advises the Executive Management Team 
and reports on the current status of Code 
deployment. Additionally, EC members 
oversee investigations to ensure all 
misconduct reports and supporting actions 
are appropriate and complete.Global

Our approach
Our Code of Conduct details our commitment to 
preventing corruption and promoting ethical business 
practices in an accessible and structured format. In single 
chapters, it provides concrete operating guidelines for 
appropriate behavior and correct procedures, including:
› How to apply the Code itself
› How we work (including anti-discrimination, 
prohibition of modern slavery, and health and safety)
› How we compete (including the topics of anti-trust, 
bribery, data protection, and trade compliance)
› How we conduct ourselves (defining guidance on gifts 
and hospitality, conflicts of interest, and social media 
usage)
› How we protect company assets (including 
specifications on proper use, intellectual property, 
confidentiality, and record retention)
› How we take responsibility (covering lobbying and 
political activity, donations, and environmental topics)
“WHAT’S YOUR LIMIT”  
NEW GLOBAL CODE OF CONDUCT CAMPAIGN
In August 2023, we launched a global campaign to introduce our updated Code of Conduct 
to all employees. The “What’s your limit?” campaign promoted the values and principles 
that guide ethical business conduct at Nexperia and encouraged employees to speak up. 
We used multiple channels to promote these key messages: 
› Poster campaign: Eight eye-catching poster 
designs, each highlighting a different 
violation and the response actions 
employees can take. To support each site’s 
unique context, our Ethics Liaisons carefully 
selected the posters most relevant to their 
operations. They were available in German, 
English, and Chinese, ensuring accessibility 
for our diverse workforce. 
› SpeakUp Line business cards: Business cards 
with information about our confidential 
SpeakUp Line, reminding employees to 
report any concerns and seek guidance via 
our hotline.
› Round table discussions: Across our 
sites, we facilitated round table events 
where management, Ethics Liaisons, and 
employees discussed the Code of Conduct 
and related topics. These dialogues 
fostered a clear understanding of the 
Code and reinforced our commitment to 
ethical conduct and a transparent speak-up 
culture.
› Town hall meetings: Our Code of Conduct 
campaign was highlighted at local town 
hall meetings. Management emphasized 
the importance of compliance, respectful 
behavior, and the role each employee plays 
in upholding our values.
› Enhanced training: In 2023, we updated 
our Code of Conduct training incorporating 
the campaign and our additional content 
on Diversity & Inclusion (D&I).

In 2023, all members of TeamNexperia attended a 
mandatory Code of Conduct training. We conduct this 
training annually and monitor participation. The next 
round is scheduled for November 2024. In the meantime, 
new employees must complete the training and sign 
the Code of Conduct during their company onboarding. 
Our Code of Conduct training guides employees on 
conducting business in line with Nexperia’s core values 
and principles. The main topics cover how we treat our 
colleagues, suppliers, and customers and how employees 
can make ethical decisions in the workplace. The training 
included example scenarios, questions about conflicts 
of interest, and lessons about respecting each other and 
company assets.
To support the values of our Code of Conduct, we have 
implemented internal measures, including monitoring, 
to detect and prevent bribery, conflicts of interest, and 
other forms of corruption and business ethics violations. 
We have an entity-level internal control that specifically 
addresses the risk of unethical business practices and 
non-compliance with the Code. We execute this control 
at least once a year, including risk assessments of cases 
reported via our Whistleblower hotline. 
We have also established due diligence procedures to 
assess the integrity of potential suppliers and business 
partners and mitigate any compliance and ethics 
risks. These procedures are detailed in the “Supplier 
Engagement” chapter, which includes the Social 
Responsibility Auditable Standard we use to audit our 
internal and external operations, including our supply 
chain.
“Our Code of Conduct is the guiding 
document that raises awareness 
about all forms of unethical business 
conduct, including corruption, 
bribery, and harassment.”

Additionally, we address fraud and corruption risks 
through additional controls, such as supplier selection 
process controls. However, the cornerstone of effective 
compliance management lies in the initial step of 
identifying risks and actual cases. For this purpose, we 
utilize incident report hierarchies we have established at 
each site.
We encourage our employees to speak up and address 
any concerns if they witness actions violating our Code 
of Conduct. In many cases, simply raising questions is 
enough to prevent non-compliant behavior. We also 
recommend that employees contact and consult their 
managers to discuss relevant matters. If these actions 
do not resolve the issue, our stakeholders can contact 
their local Ethics Liaison (serving as an independent 
ombudsperson) or our Ethics Committee. Our Code of 
Conduct details the full procedure.

Whistleblowing
We provide several ways for our 
employees and stakeholders to report 
suspected cases of misconduct. Our 
primary investigation mechanism is 
the SpeakUp Line, which is available 
24/7 in all relevant languages. It is an 
external, independent, anonymous, 
and confidential reporting channel 
available to all employees, suppliers, 
business partners, and other third-
party stakeholders. Available via a free 
telephone number, the SpeakUp Line 
offers a secure webpage that provides 
the caller with clear instructions. 
We actively promote the line to our 
employees and third parties and test the 
service provider annually to maintain 
quality. 
The EC is notified of each submission 
and given adequate time to thoroughly 
consider and investigate the issue. All 
submissions are treated with strict 
confidentiality. The EC can inform the 
caller that their message has been 
received and ask follow-up questions. 
The caller then has the option to submit 
a new message, either immediately or 
at a later time. This format facilitates 
an ongoing dialogue that can remain 
anonymous if desired. Any form of 
retaliation against a person reporting 
suspected misconduct in good faith or 
participating in a related investigation 
is strictly prohibited. We have clear 
boundaries that no one shall discharge, 
demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or 
discriminate against a person reporting 
suspected violations of the Code. We 
also guarantee the protection of each 
whistleblower as part of our Code of 
Conduct.
We investigate all reports of suspected 
misconduct promptly and thoroughly 
and take appropriate actions on 
substantiated claims. For liable 
individuals, these actions may impact 
their future employment at Nexperia 
and result in legal repercussions. We 
also monitor and assess all logged cases 
using a range of metrics. This approach, 
combined with the increased likelihood 
of discovery, also serves as a deterrent.
In 2023, we received 54 submissions via 
the SpeakUp Line. We have followed up 
on all cases in compliance with our EC 
guidelines. During the reporting year, 
there were no legal actions pending or 
completed regarding anti-competitive 
behavior or violations of anti-trust or 
monopoly legislation.

Contributions
An essential aspect of ethical business 
is transparency regarding lobbying and 
political contributions. Accordingly, we 
specify our perspective on these matters 
in two chapters of our Code of Conduct.
While our business activities include 
engaging with governments and 
governmental organizations, we never 
make payments to political candidates or 
support political activities on behalf of 
Nexperia. We have a general rule not to 
pay any advisory fees, make payments, 
or donate money or in-kind support to 
political parties, political organizations, 
or individual politicians. As part of the 
Code, any envisaged diversions from this 
principle must be explicitly approved 
by our management, and all public 
disclosure requirements must be met in 
full.
When preparing this Sustainability 
Report, we assessed all donations 
and membership fees to industry 
associations, interest groups, and 
think tanks in 2023. Nexperia did not 
record any cases of financial or in-kind 
political contributions, either directly or 
indirectly.

Responsible Sourcing and 
Supplier Engagement
As supply chain sustainability is essential to 
our Company, we ask all suppliers to sign our 
Supplier Statement of Conformity. This binding 
contractual agreement requires suppliers to 
maintain strict compliance with our Supplier 
Code of Conduct. Nexperia's Supplier Code 
of Conduct aligns with the principles of the 
Code of Conduct of the Responsible Business 
Alliance (RBA), which we joined in 2017. Our 
Supplier Code of Conduct is guided by globally 
recognized standards, such as the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), and 
standards issued by organizations such as 
the International Labor Organization (ILO), 
Social Accountability International (SAI), and 
the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI). The Code 
provides commitments and guidance on 
labor and human rights, health and safety, 
environment, business ethics, and standards for 
management systems in use. 
Overview and  
management approach
Nexperia sources components and materials 
from all over the world, including regions 
where we cannot assume human and labor 
rights are upheld as standard. This concern is 
especially true for specific resources, which 
require extra diligence to source responsibly 
and from conflict-free areas. To assist these 
efforts, we rely on established, long-term 
partnerships with our suppliers and contractors 
and seek to create mutually beneficial 
relationships. We also regularly communicate 
sustainability topics to our suppliers and 
encourage them to report any problems or 
concerns. As part of this approach, we seek to 
award our business to suppliers that act fairly 
and with integrity toward their stakeholders, 
observe applicable laws, and respect and 
uphold universal human rights. 
Our Sustainability Policy recognizes the critical 
importance of responsible procurement 
practices and engaging with suppliers to drive 
sustainability across our supply chain. Through 
various policies and guidelines, we cement our 
commitments to human and labor rights, fair 
working and living conditions, environmentally 
responsible business, compliance, and non-
discrimination.
Our Code of Conduct details clear guidelines 
relating to sustainability and compliance 
across our supply chains. For example, we 
make it clear that Nexperia respects and 
recognizes labor and human rights worldwide, 
and we expect our suppliers to do the same. 
Additionally, our Code describes the grievance 
mechanisms for actions that violate our Code 
of Conduct. Any suspected or confirmed 
breaches or incidents can be reported through 
channels such as our SpeakUp Line.

Additionally, we work with a range 
of procedure descriptions for audits, 
assurance processes, or necessary 
management actions against unethical 
suppliers, which are described on the 
following pages.
Many of the sustainability topics 
material to our operations are also 
relevant in our supply chain. We 
acknowledge and manage these 
overlaps by clarifying our principles and 
commitments and encouraging our 
suppliers to mirror them. For example, 
in the area of water and wastewater, we 
recommend our suppliers implement 
systematic approaches to wastewater 
generated in their operations, industrial 
processes, and sanitation facilities, 
and to monitor, control, and treat 
wastewater in line with legislation prior 
to discharge or disposal. In addition, we 
request they work to reduce the amount 
of wastewater generated, regularly 
monitor wastewater treatment systems, 
and provide Nexperia with ongoing 
updates.
Overall accountability for responsible 
sourcing and supplier engagement 
extends to our management team. It 
includes the COO, Chief Procurement 
Officer (CPO), VP of Quality, and 
Senior Director of Global Environment, 
Health, and Safety (EHS) and Corporate 
Social Responsibility (CSR), who 
also leads the topics from a social 
responsibility perspective. In 2023, our 
Global Procurement department was 
accountable for supplier selection and 
management, while supplier audits 
were performed by our Supplier Quality 
department and EHS department. 
The EHS and CSR department is 
accountable for monitoring the audit 
program and overseeing corrective 
actions. In turn, we expect suppliers 
to cooperate with our audits and 
implement containment and remedial 
measures for any identified issues. 
We coordinate these actions using 
our Social Responsibility Management 
System, which comprises various policies 
and other building blocks described 
below. In Q1 2024, given this topic's 
overall criticality, we introduced our 
new Procurement Sustainability and 
Risk Management department within 
Global Procurement and transferred 
responsibility for supplier audits. 
144
GOVERNANCE REPORTINGnexperia | Sustainability Report 2023

Page 145:
Our approach:  
careful supplier selection and 
management
We are committed to working with suppliers 
who share our values and dedication to 
sustainability. To achieve this aim, we have 
established supplier selection criteria 
that include sustainability and ethical 
considerations, along with other factors such as 
quality, cost, and delivery.
Supplier selection 
We select and approve new suppliers following defined 
standards and procedures. New suppliers must meet 
various preselection criteria, including assessments 
and scores on CSR and sustainability acceptance. Using 
a risk-based approach, we ask suppliers to complete a 
self-assessment questionnaire to gauge their compliance 
with our EHS sustainability and social responsibility 
requirements. Each questionnaire must be reviewed and 
signed by a member of the supplier’s top management 
and then approved internally by our EHS and CSR 
department. In early 2024, the responsibility for our 
internal approval process was transferred to Global 
Procurement.
If the potential supplier cannot meet our requirements, 
we either attempt to reach mutual values by defining 
new engagement measures or reject their registration 
and explain why we cannot engage further. Our Global 
Procurement Organization controls the entire supplier 
selection and approval process. It comprises the COO 
and the Technology & Operation Management Team.
One vital element of our supplier management 
processes is our RBA-aligned Supplier Code of Conduct, 
which all active suppliers must sign. If a supplier refuses, 
our supplier selection and approval process includes 
various escalation scenarios. These scenarios can involve 
accepting the suppliers’ own Code of Conduct after 
a comprehensive review, or customized proceedings 
defined by our Procurement Management Team.
Until December 2023, Nexperia’s Supplier Code 
of Conduct was managed by our Corporate Social 
Responsibility function within the EHS organization. 
However, given this topic’s critical and dynamic nature, 
we introduced a dedicated department, Procurement 
Sustainability and Risk Management, within our Global 
Procurement organization in Q4 2023. Starting in Q1 
2024, this new function oversees topics related to 
responsible supply chains, including but not limited 
to the Supplier Code of Conduct and continuously 
improving our supplier engagement processes. 
As part of our commitment to fostering more 
sustainable supply chains, we frequently revise our 
Code with updates released by the RBA, international 
regulations, and the latest industry benchmarks. In cases 
where our customers’ Social Responsibility requirements 
exceed those of the RBA Code of Conduct, we may 
assess and integrate them into our procedures to 
enhance our existing system. We performed a major 
update to improve our Supplier Code of Conduct in the 
second half of 2023. In February 2024, we initiated a 
global rollout of the revised Code to all active suppliers 
with a targeted coverage rate of at least 80%. 
› A supplier is classed as active if it has a recorded spend, 
purchase order, invoice, or any open transaction within 
the past 18 months. Additionally, a supplier is classed 
as active in cases of master data changes in the past 18 
months or if transactions are planned in the future.
› Coverage Rate includes either a signature or the 
supplier's own approved Code of Conduct (after an 
internal Nexperia review).
In 2023, we had 4,201 active suppliers, of which 74% 
signed the Nexperia Supplier Code of Conduct at the 
end of Q4 2023.

Sourcing strategy
Local sourcing is crucial to our Sourcing Strategy, as 
it supports local economies and reduces our carbon 
footprint by minimizing transport emissions. We 
balance this ambition with our need for a diverse and 
resilient supply chain, which is another of our long-term 
objectives. Nexperia sources approximately 55% from 
local suppliers.

The role of audits 
Auditing is an essential aspect of promoting responsible 
procurement and sustainability across our supply chain. 
We have a comprehensive audit standard in our Auditing 
Procedure Policy, which covers internal and certification 
audits for our operations and supplier audits. We 
use these audits to verify suppliers’ adherence to 
our requirements, including human and labor rights, 
conformity with international standards, governance and 
compliance, and environmental topics. In this process, 
we follow the requirements of our Social Responsibility 
Auditable Standard, which strictly adheres to RBA 
Validated Assessment Program (VAP) specifications. 
It also includes requirements from the ISO 14001 and 
ISO 45001 management system standards. We audit 
contractors according to our internal audit program 
guidelines.
As strong collaborations are also critical to driving 
sustainability in our supply chain, we regularly monitor 
the sustainability performance of our suppliers. One 
valuable source of information is the NGO engagement 
that comes with our RBA membership. We ascertain 
whether a supplier audit is necessary via a yearly risk 
assessment of each supplier, in line with our Supplier 
Social Responsibility Risk Assessment Process. If a 
supplier exceeds selected risk thresholds or continually 
shows low ESG performance, we engage them for an 
audit. Relative to the threshold surpassed, our EHS and 
CSR department chooses either a mandatory on-site 
audit performed by Nexperia or an RBA VAP audit.

These on-site audits are part of the Nexperia 
Supplier Social Responsibility Audit Program, 
which drives a collaborative approach to 
our supplier and contractor relationships. 
We promote continuous improvement in 
our supply chain by conducting annual risk 
assessments and auditing suppliers we 
identify as high-risk. We developed this risk 
assessment process with our Procurement 
department and review and update it annually 
to reflect the evolving environmental, labor, 
and human rights landscape. Our supplier 
risk assessment considers criteria such as 
geographical risk, product and/or service risk, 
and business criticality or spend risk. We assign 
each category a score of 1 to 10 (10 being the 
highest) to generate a percentage that signifies 
the supplier’s risk level, with higher numbers 
indicating higher risk exposure.
Nexperia’s Social Responsibility Audit Program 
is a collaborative and consultative process 
that guides suppliers to meet the Nexperia 
Supplier Code of Conduct and Nexperia 
Auditable Standards on Social Responsibility. 
The audit scope covers labor and human rights, 
the environment, health and safety, business 
ethics, management systems, and compliance 
with the Nexperia Supplier Code of Conduct. 
We conduct these audits to help our suppliers 
improve their processes and procedures in 
these areas. The Nexperia Supplier Code of 
Conduct and the Auditable Standards apply 
to all Nexperia suppliers, contractors, on-site 
service providers, labor agents, and external 
manufacturers.
In 2023, we performed 19 social responsibility 
supplier audits and intend to increase this 
number each year. 
In 2023, we extended our audits to the USA and Singapore. We did not perform audits in the Philippines.

We work closely with suppliers who have 
audit non-conformances (NCs) to ensure they 
fully understand our standards and have the 
necessary skills and knowledge to prevent 
reoccurrence. We also use the results of these 
efforts to evaluate the effectiveness of our 
standards within the supply chain. In 2023, we 
recorded 295 supplier findings, including 34 
core violations, 255 major NCs, and 6 minor 
NCs. Most suppliers were willing to rectify the 
findings within the specified timeframe and 
comply with Nexperia's requirements. We allow 
a minimum threshold to our suppliers when 
closing the NC's because we understand that 
certain corrective actions, such as financial 
investments and labor interruptions, may 
require more than 90 days to resolve. The 
most frequently reported NC's through our SR 
supplier audit program are related to working 
hours and consecutive working days.
In addition to ongoing risk assessments 
and audits through our Supplier Social 
Responsibility Audit Program, our 
whistleblower SpeakUp Line provides our 
management with valuable feedback and 
highlights potential issues in our supply chains. 
The line is available 24/7 in all languages and 
can be used by our stakeholders to report any 
ESG issues they identify. The SpeakUp Line is 
further described in the “Business Integrity and 
Ethics” chapter.

Our commitment to sourcing minerals responsibly
Semiconductor device production relies on metals 
like tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold (known as 3TGs 
or Conflict Minerals), as well as cobalt. These metals 
often come from conflict-affected and high-risk areas 
(CAHRAs), where their extraction and trade may 
finance armed groups, fuel human rights abuses, 
and support corruption and money laundering. As a 
socially responsible company, we prioritize ethical and 
sustainable sourcing practices to ensure our products do 
not create negative social or environmental impacts.
We are committed to reducing the use of 3TGs and 
cobalt in our products and supply chains and apply 
rigorous due diligence when their use is necessary. As 
an active member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative 
(RMI), we promote responsible mineral sourcing and 
adhere to RMI's risk assessment procedures and tools, 
which are regarded as industry standards. We also 
support independent third-party audits by the RMI 
through its Responsible Minerals Assurance Process 
(RMAP) and assessment programs that are cross-
recognized by RMI for their effectiveness. We design 
our processes to comply with the OECD Due Diligence 
Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals and 
other relevant laws and regulations.
Our procurement team uses a risk-based approach to 
screen suppliers of materials and finished goods for the 
presence of 3TGs and cobalt. This method is part of our 
internal Responsible Minerals Assurance Process, a set 
of comprehensive guidelines and procedures we have 
developed to meticulously document and specify all 
relevant information about these suppliers. Setting clear 
supplier expectations is vital to achieving our responsible 
sourcing goals, which are reflected in our Supplier Code 
of Conduct. We require all direct suppliers, contractors, 
and external manufacturers to adopt policies and 
conduct due diligence on the sources and chains of 
custody of minerals. Going a step further, they must 
also ensure their own suppliers adhere to Nexperia’s 
principles and align with the OECD Due Diligence 
Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from 
Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas.
Responsible sourcing practices are vital to our business 
sustainability, but they are also crucial to the welfare 
of communities and environments impacted by our 
operations. With this in mind, we are committed to 
leading by example, continuously innovating, and 
enhancing our responsible mineral sourcing practices to 
create positive social and environmental outcomes.
We will continue collaborating with suppliers to increase 
transparency and develop joint initiatives and programs 
that reduce our environmental impact and improve 
social responsibility.

Head of Nexperia Procurement Operations & Sustainability  
Global Procurement
“The essential semiconductors we build have a 
remarkable reach. Virtually every commercial electronic 
device worldwide is enabled by Nexperia's products. On 
average, each person in the world carries about 10 of 
our products. 
We are committed to sustainable operations that 
comply with the latest legislation. It goes without saying 
that we in procurement regard our ethical business 
values, constituted in our Supplier Code of Conduct, 
as the foundation for a trustworthy and responsible 
business partnership with our suppliers. 
Of course, the German Supply Chain Act requires more 
effort on our end, but it also strengthens an even more 
diligent and conscious sourcing choice. Our sourcing 
process is updated to apply globally, i.e., to all of our 
sites, to be ready once the Corporate Sustainability Due 
Diligence Directive (CSDDD) becomes effective. It sets 
a valuable legal framework that will help our business 
grow sustainably – in the truest sense of the word.”

Compliance with the German Supply Chain  
Due Diligence Act
From January 2024 onward, the German Supply 
Chain Due Diligence Act applies to Nexperia 
Germany GmbH. In preparation, we established 
the necessary standards and protocols 
supported by various measures and compliance 
targets. These efforts aim to ensure equal 
rights for everyone involved in our supply chain 
and our internal operations.
We also formed an expert team responsible 
for all processes relating to supply chain due 
diligence. Representing departments such 
as Procurement, Legal, Sustainability, and 
Environment, Health and Safety (EHS), the 
team combines the varied expertise needed for 
the expansive nature of this regulation and all 
underlying processes.
To prepare for these new supply chain due 
diligence requirements, we implemented a 
Human Rights Office represented by our Legal 
and Sustainability departments. Our Head of 
Sustainability is responsible for investigating 
internal and external human rights and 
environmental complaints, while our Ethics 
Committee is responsible for investigating 
internal and external ethics-related complaints. 
The committee is supported by local Ethics 
Liaison Officers at several Nexperia sites. Our 
SpeakUp Line, Nexperia’s complaint mechanism 
for internal and external cases, is accessible to 
employees and external parties via telephone 
and email. Reports can be made anonymously 
and are treated confidentially.
Across the Company, we draw on a range of 
effective existing processes and functions, 
which we adapted to the new requirements 
as needed. Over the last few years, our EHS 
team has continuously developed our Social 
Responsibility management structures and our 
supplier screening and auditing processes. We 
reviewed and revised global processes focusing 
on sustainability to better meet due diligence 
requirements along our supply chain. Our newly 
formed procurement sustainability and risk 
management team has assumed responsibility 
for supply chain due diligence and social 
responsibility, strengthening our direct supplier 
engagement.

We expect a seamless adoption of the German 
Supply Chain Due Diligence Act requirements, 
based on the following additional measures 
and our Company-wide experience:
› Several sites are already within the scope of 
the UK Modern Slavery Act, contributing vital 
experience with human rights regulations.
› We are implementing a software solution 
for automated visibility and transparency of 
supply chain risks.
› In Q4 2023, we published our Whistleblowing 
FAQ on Nexperia's approach to managing 
internal and external complaints.
› In Q1 2024, we published a Policy Statement 
on our approach to due diligence obligations 
regarding human rights and environmental 
topics.
In 2023, we conducted a comprehensive risk 
analysis to further prepare for new human 
rights and environmental due diligence 
regulations. Our method included an index 
analysis of country-specific risks followed by 
a text-based analysis of industry-specific risks. 
We categorized risks into no risk, low risk, 
medium risk, severe risk, and critical risk. Our 
risk analysis found that material risks include 
working hours, minimum wage, discrimination, 
and pollution of water, soil, and air. In response, 
we have prioritized these risks accordingly in 
our due diligence processes and measures.

Cybersecurity, Data Protection, 
and Privacy 
Overview and management approach
The compliant handling of information is critical for leading 
innovation companies like Nexperia. In the area of cybersecurity, 
the scope of our responsibility covers product and process 
information as well as personal data. When using all forms of 
personal data, we respect and protect the privacy and rights 
of our customers, employees, business partners, and all other 
relevant parties.
Through our global security infrastructure and crisis 
management team - comprising our Chief Information Officer 
(CIO), Information Security (InfoSec) Management within our 
IT department, and our Data Protection Officer (DPO) - we are 
well prepared against cyberattacks or other leaks that may 
compromise our systems. 
Our diverse range of data protection systems, privacy policies, 
and associated standards comply with all applicable laws and 
are communicated to our employees via an annual awareness 
training. We also regularly engage third parties to stress test our 
security systems to evaluate and reinforce their defences.
As a responsible company and employer, we 
strictly adhere to all regulations and legal 
agreements concerning data protection. By 
doing so, we protect the interests and rights 
of our customers, employees, and suppliers 
while safeguarding our critical information 
assets. 
At the group level, cybersecurity is managed 
by the Office of the CIO and InfoSec within 
our IT department. Data protection is 
managed by our global legal team which 
has an appointed DPO. Our global data 
protection and awareness training is 
organized by our InfoSec Management. 
We use the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology (NIST) Cyber Framework 
as the foundation of our cybersecurity 
approach. It is based on five key steps: 
identify, protect, detect, respond, and 
recover. The NIST Cyber Framework helps 
us develop an organizational understanding 
of how to manage cybersecurity risks to 
our systems, assets, and data and protect 
our critical infrastructure. By implementing 
appropriate activities and mechanisms, 
we can quickly identify any cybersecurity 
incidents and respond appropriately. We can 
also maintain resilience and recover our data 
and services in the event of a cybersecurity 
incident.
The security monitoring of our global IT 
infrastructure environment is maintained 
by an external service provider. It 
operates 24/7 and immediately reports 
any identified security incidents to our 
Infosec Management. Through our 
vulnerability management, we can check 
and eliminate any system liabilities via 
regular scans of our global infrastructure. 
Our service provider can also provide a 
security incident response at any time 
upon request. Incidents are passed to our 
relevant IT resolver groups, which directly 
mitigate the vulnerabilities. Through our 
use of Cyber Threat Intelligence, which is 
knowledge-, capability-, and experience-
based information about the occurrence 
and assessment of threats and threat actors, 
we are well prepared against all potential 
cyberattacks.

handling and high security standards

Zero “high-level data breaches” in 2023
All company-wide incidents and alerts are reported 
immediately to our global InfoSec team. Any potential 
data loss incidents are automatically labeled as “P1,” 
our highest level of IT security breach. These levels are 
determined by the Security Operations Center. Should 
a P1 security breach occur at any site, all processes are 
managed by the global InfoSec team, which includes the 
CIO. The DPO is also involved if the P1 security breach 
relates to privacy. InfoSec, the CIO, and DPO initiate all 
necessary measures to remedy data leaks and comply 
with legal reporting requirements. We did not record 
any P1 data breaches in 2023.
Key policies
We define our group-wide principles for processing 
personal data using our various data protection and 
privacy policies, combined with relevant standards and 
procedures. Our approach to data protection is based 
on European legislation, particularly the EU’s General 
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). To strengthen our 
systems, we also take measures to comply with local data 
protection regulations if they are stricter than our own 
applicable standards. For transparency, our employees 
can access all standards and procedures via the Nexperia 
Document Management System. Our stakeholders, 
customers, and suppliers can also learn how we use their 
data by reading our website’s Privacy notice.
Awareness training
Our cybersecurity and data protection strategies, 
policies, standards, and procedures are cascaded 
globally in conjunction with local IT and business 
teams, coordinated by the global InfoSec manager. We 
conduct and monitor a mandatory annual awareness 
training for all employees. Infosec manages all training 
sessions in cooperation with local training teams. To 
maintain awareness about data protection beyond 
these sessions, we also distribute regular articles in 
Nexperia's e-magazine, X.Press. We also offer more 
in-depth training to the departments responsible for 
handling personal data on a daily basis, with a primary 
focus on HR. All employees must complete awareness 
trainings relating to quality and security every two years 
and our Code of Conduct every year. We ensure that 
the completion rate reaches at least 80% and all new 
employees complete these mandatory trainings within 
72 hours as part of their onboarding. 
Assessments and measures:  
third party tests in 2023
We continually assess our protective measures to 
enhance the effectiveness of our security systems. As 
part of this approach, we engage third-party experts 
to evaluate our security infrastructure. In the category 
of Security Incident Response, we received a “solid 
foundation” result. In 2022, we also complied with 
the provider’s recommendations to help strengthen 
communication between our IT and crisis management 
teams. 
We conducted our last IT assessment in 2021 as part 
of the Cybersecurity Maturity Assessment. In 2022, we 
conducted an Operational Technology (OT) Assessment 
and incorporated the results into our 2023+ program. 
For 2023 and beyond, this program adopts a series 
of technical and organizational measures to improve 
cybersecurity in our factories and OT. In 2024, we plan 
to perform a Trusted Information Security Assessment 
Exchange assessment (TISAX), aiming to demonstrate 
compliance with the high security standards of our 
clients in the automotive industry. For security purposes, 
we refrain from disclosing specific measures in this 
report.  
A third-party penetration test during the Technical 
Cybersecurity Assessments in 2022 confirmed we have 
all relevant security controls in place. The next third-
party penetration test is scheduled for 2024. 
In March 2024, Nexperia became 
aware that an unauthorized third 
party accessed certain Nexperia IT 
servers. We promptly took action 
to terminate the unauthorized 
access, launched an investigation, 
and reported this incident to the 
competent authorities and police.

Page 173:
We have examined the indicators in the 
Sustainability Report 2023 of Nexperia Holding 
B.V. for 2023. Other information included in 
the Report are not in scope of this limited 
assurance sustainability engagement. We were 
not engaged to report on or conclude on other 
information presented within the Sustainability 
Report 2023 which is outside our scope.  
Our Conclusion
Based on the procedures performed and 
evidence obtained, nothing has come to our 
attention that causes us to believe that the 
selected non-financial indicators marked 
with the checkbox symbol in the Nexperia 
Sustainability Report 2023 over 2023 are 
not prepared in all material respects, with 
reference to the Sustainability Reporting 
Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative 
(GRI) and in accordance with the applied 
supplemental reporting criteria as included 
in the “Glossary” of the report as the basis to 
evaluate the indicators.
What we have examined
The object of our assurance engagement 
concerns the selected non-financial indicators 
(hereafter: the indicators) for the year ended 
December 31, 2023. The indicators examined 
are as follows: 
Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions  
(tons CO2 equivalent);
Share of women in management 
positions (%); 
Share of women in senior 
management positions (%);
Annual promotion rate (%);
Total Case Incident Rate (TCIR)  
(per 200,000);
Share of suppliers signed Nexperia 
Supplier Code of Conduct (%).

The basis for our conclusion
We conducted our examination in 
accordance with Dutch law, including 
the Dutch Standard 3000A Assurance 
engagements, other than audits or 
reviews of historical financial information 
(attestation-engagements). This 
engagement is aimed to provide limited 
assurance. Our responsibilities under 
this standard are further described in 
the section ‘Our responsibilities for the 
examination’ of our report.
We believe that the assurance 
information we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our conclusion.
Independence and quality control
We are independent of Nexperia Holding 
B.V. in accordance with the ‘Verordening 
inzake de onafhankelijkheid van 
accountants bij assurance opdrachten’ 
(ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional 
Accountants, a regulation with respect 
to independence) and other relevant 
independence requirements in the 
Netherlands. Furthermore we have 
complied with the ‘Verordening 
gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants’ 
(VGBA, Code of Ethics for Professional 
Accountants, a regulation with respect to 
rules of professional conduct).
PwC applies the ‘Nadere voorschriften 
kwaliteitssystemen’ (NVKS, Regulations 
for quality systems) and accordingly 
maintains a comprehensive system of 
quality control including documented 
policies and procedures regarding 
compliance with ethical requirements, 
professional standards and other 
applicable legal and regulatory 
requirements.
Applicable criteria
The indicators need to be read and 
understood together with the reporting 
criteria. The reporting criteria used for 
the preparation of the indicator is the 
Sustainability Reporting Standards of 
the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and 
the applied supplemental reporting 
criteria as included in the ‘Glossary’ 
of the report. The absence of an 
established practice on which to draw, 
to evaluate and measure non-financial 
information allows for different, but 
acceptable, measurement techniques 
and can affect comparability between 
entities, and over time.
Responsibilities of the management 
board 
The management board of Nexperia 
Holding B.V. is responsible for the 
preparation of the Indicators with 
reference to Sustainability Reporting 
Standards of the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI) and in accordance with 
the applied supplemental reporting 
criteria as included in the report as 
the basis to evaluate the indicators, 
including the identification of the 
intended users and the criteria being 
applicable for the purpose of these 
users.
Furthermore, the management board is 
responsible for such internal control as 
it determines is necessary to enable the 
preparation of the Indicators that is free 
from material omission, whether due to 
fraud or error.
The management board is responsible 
for overseeing the company’s reporting 
process on the Indicators.
Responsibilities for the indicators and 
the examination thereof 
Our responsibilities for the 
examination
Our responsibility is to plan and perform 
our examination in a manner that allows 
us to obtain sufficient and appropriate 
evidence to provide a basis for our 
conclusion.
Our conclusion aims to provide limited 
assurance. The procedures performed 
in this context consisted primarily of 
making inquiries with officers of the 
entity and determining the plausibility 
of the information included in the 
indicators. The level of assurance 
obtained in a limited assurance 
engagement is substantially lower than 
the assurance that would have been 
obtained had a reasonable assurance 
engagement been performed.
Procedures performed
We have exercised professional 
judgement and have maintained 
professional scepticism throughout 
the examination in accordance with 
the Dutch Standard 3000A, ethical 
requirements and independence 
requirements.

Our examination consisted, among 
other things of the following:
› Identifying areas of the indicators with 
a higher risk of a material omission, 
whether due to fraud or error, 
designing and performing assurance 
procedures responsive to those 
risks, and obtaining evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a

suitability of the criteria used, their 
consistent application and related 
disclosures to the indicators.
› Assessing the suitability of the criteria 
used, their consistent application and 
related disclosures to the indicators.
› Through inquiries, obtaining a 
general understanding of the control 
environment, the reporting processes, 
and the information systems and 
the entity’s risk assessment process 
relevant to the preparation of 
the indicators, without obtaining 
assurance evidence about the 
implementation or testing the 
operating effectiveness of controls.
› Designing and performing assurance 
procedures aimed at determining the 
plausibility of the indicators, responsive 
to the risk analysis. These procedures 
consisted amongst others of:
› inquiring management and/or 
relevant staff at corporate level 
responsible for the sustainability 
strategy, policy and results;
› inquiring relevant staff responsible 
for providing the information 
for, carrying out internal control 
procedures on, and consolidating the 
data of the indicators;
› obtaining assurance evidence 
that the indicators reconcile with 
underlying records of the company;
› reviewing, on a limited test basis, 
relevant internal and external 
documentation;
› performing an analytical review of 
the data and trends of the indicators 
submitted for consolidation at 
corporate level.
› Reading the information other than 
the indicators in the Sustainability 
Report 2023, which is not included in 
the scope of our review, to identify 
material inconsistencies with the 
indicators.

Share of Women in 
Management positions 
(%)
The percentage of women in management positions, 
is calculated by dividing the number of women in 
management positions by the total number of management 
positions. Nexperia defines management position as 
a position that has a minimum of one person directly 
reporting. Direct reports (subordinates) are classified as 
other employees who directly report to an employee in a 
manager/management position.
Share of Women in 
Senior Management 
positions (%)
The percentage of women in Senior Management 
positions, is calculated by dividing the number of women 
in Senior Management positions by the total number of 
Senior Management positions. Nexperia defines Senior 
Management position as a position with a job grade 70 and 
above.

Term Definition
Reporting period January 1, 2023 – December 31, 2023.
Scope All indicators are calculated based on all Nexperia entities.
Scope 1 and 2 GHG 
emissions
Scope 1 emissions: direct greenhouse (GHG) emissions 
that occur from sources that are controlled or owned 
by our organization (e.g., emissions associated with fuel 
combustion in boilers, furnaces, vehicles).
Scope 2 emissions: indirect GHG emissions associated with 
the purchase of electricity, steam, heat, or cooling, reported 
on market-based approach. Calculation of our scope 1 and

Term Definition
Indirect labor Indirect labor refers to the salaries and wages paid to 
workers not directly involved in the manufacture of a 
specific product or in performing a service.  At Nexperia, 
usually desk and/or computer workers.
Total Case Incident Rate 
(TCIR)
TCIR is a measure used by OSHA to assess workplace  safety. 
It calculates the total number of work-related injuries and 
illnesses per 100 FTE over a specific period.
We calculated TCIR by dividing the total number of 
recordable cases by the total hours worked by all employees, 
then multiplied by 200,000.
We encountered difficulties in gathering precise data 
for total hours worked by employees, particularly at our 
manufacturing sites. Therefore, we used number of FTE 
and contractual working hours for our sites in Seremban 
(Malaysia) and Cabuyao (Philippines), and number of FTE and 
legal working hours for our site in Dongguan (China).
Share of suppliers 
signed Nexperia 
Supplier Code of 
Conduct (%)
Percentage of active suppliers signed supplier CoC (signature 
of approval of own Supplier CoC) is calculated by: 
Total active supplies which have signed the supplier code of 
conduct/total list of active suppliers.
Active supplier Active supplier has a recorded spend, purchase order,
invoice, or any open transaction within the past 18
months. A supplier is active in cases of master data
changes in the past 18 months or if transactions are
planned in the future.
Term Definition
Annual promotion rate Percentage of employees promoted during reporting period.
We calculated annual promotion rate percentage by 
dividing our annual promotion count by average headcount 
of the reporting year and multiplied by 100. Our average 
headcount is the sum of headcount beginning of the year 
and headcount end of the year divided by 2. 
A promotion is a move to a higher job level that has greater 
impact, complexity, responsibility, and authority, and 
therefore a higher job grade, a job grade change from lower 
to higher. The promotional increase is dependent on the 
position of the employee’s current salary in the new salary 
range. 
There are two approaches to when a promotion takes place:
Direct labor: the promotion of an employee performing 
direct labour, is based on a decentralized performance 
review. There is no standard procedure which is followed 
to evaluate the performance of these employees. The 
promotion of these employees are registered in Workday 
(HRIS) and do not hold any other supporting evidence. 
Employees performing direct labor often hold a position with 
job grade of 50. 
Indirect labor: A promotion occurs when an employee moves 
up in job grade, an example of this could be moving from job 
grade 50 to 60. The promotion process follows the following 
steps:  Promotions are reviewed via the Talent Review model. 
Direct labor Direct labor refers to the salaries and wages paid to workers 
directly involved in the manufacture of a specific product 
or in performing a service. At Nexperia usually line and/or 
production workers.
