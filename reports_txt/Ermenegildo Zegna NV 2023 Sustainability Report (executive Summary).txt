OUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
Traceable & lower impact top priority raw materials trend
Top priority raw materials (wool, cashmere, cotton, leather, man-made cellulosics, polyester and linen)  
account for about 72% of total raw materials purchased in 2023. On December 31, 2023, the share of top 
priority raw materials sourced from traceable origin and from lower-impact sources was 32%, with key 
contributions from Authentico ® wool, Sustainable Fiber Alliance cashmere, and linen certified by Masters of 
Linen® and European Flax®. This progress is aligned with our target to reach 50% of top-priority raw materials 
traced to the geography of origin and from lower-impact sources by 2026.

Total emissions scope 3
In 2023, scope 1 + scope 2 market-based CO 2e 
emissions were equal to 19,194 tonnes of CO 2e, an 
emissions decrease of 5% compared to 2022.
The Group’s scope 1 emissions, which have slightly 
increased in 2023 compared to 2022, include 
emissions deriving from the use of natural gas, 
diesel, gas oil, petrol and LPG. Conversely, scope 2 
emissions, which include the use of purchased 
electricity and heat, decreased compared to 2022 
by 2% (location-based approach) and  10% (market-
based approach). This is due to a decrease in 
consumption of energy from electricity, as well as 
growth in the share of consumed energy from 
renewable sources.
In 2023, considering the allocation of FLAG (Forest, 
Land and Agriculture) and non-FLAG targets and in 
light of the acquisition of Tom Ford International 
LLC on April 28, 2023, the Group analyzed how 
these factors impacted our scope 3 emissions 
across the scope 3 categories. As a result of the 
analysis, Scope 3 cat. 15 (investments) estimates for 
emissions were recalculated for FY 2022 and FY 
2021 not considering Tom Ford International LLC 
as an investment. Moreover, the Group also fine-
tuned the methodological approach for the 
calculation of the following categories: 3.1, 3.2, 3.8, 
3.9 and 3.14 and consequently updated FY 2022 
and FY 2021 data. For previously disclosed data 
related to FY2022 and FY2021 please refer to the 
2022 Group Sustainability Report.
Overall, the Group’s total scope 3 emissions  
decreased by 11% in 2023 versus 2022.
Purchased goods and services account for 89% of 
the total scope 3 emissions. 74% of category 1 
emissions in FY 2023 are represented by FLAG 
emissions. Upstream transportation and 
distribution accounts for 3% of overall emissions, 
while the remaining categories cumulatively 
account for 8%.

FIRST GROUP CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE ALIGNED WITH TCFD 
FRAMEWORK3
In 2022, we started the assessment of the financial impact of specific climate-related risks and opportunities, 
conforming to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD 4).  As 
part of the assessment we conducted a benchmark analysis to identify best practices in fighting climate 
change. Additionally, we considered our long-term strategy and identified areas potentially affected by 
climate change. The result of this analysis was the identification of three potential climate-related risks, 
encompassing both physical and transitional risks, and two potential opportunities.
RISKS
Physical risks Transition risks
• Scarcity of raw materials (assessed on 
wool and cashmere fibers) • Potential market entry challenges
• Business interruption
OPPORTUNITIES
• Promotion of sustainable branding through low-impact resources
• Use of lower-emission resources at operational level
During 2023, as for TCFD recommendations, 
identified risks and opportunities have been 
economically assessed to stress-test our business 
strategy and evaluate its resilience in achieving 
decarbonization goals, based on climate scenario 
analysis. In particular, for this analysis, we selected 
scenarios  from IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change) for the analysis of our physical 
risks, while for both the transitional risk and 
opportunities, we selected scenarios from the 
International Energy Agency (IEA). 
The assessments were performed against three 
time horizons: short (2022-2026), medium 
(2027-2032) and long (2033-2050) term.
Scenario analysis models stressed revenue and cost 
items based on climate-related factors. The impacts 
were quantified against the baseline, integrating 
results to calculate adjusted projections that 
consider pricing changes and revenue impacts. 
The goal was to achieve impact quantification on 
the EBIT baseline of the Group, excluding the TOM 
FORD FASHION segment.   
Overall, the impact across different scenarios and 
timeframes did not emerge as notably significant. In 
accordance with the Group’s ERM guidelines, a 
scale of six levels (from “very low” to “extreme”) 
were used to assess the impact of risks against the 
scenarios and timeframes analyzed. For the long 
term, the highest impact is assessed as 
“medium” (i.e. not notably significant): thus no 
immediate need for mitigation actions. 
The Group intends to continue monitoring climate-
related risks and opportunities on a regular basis, 
with the possibility of expanding the scope of the 
analysis over time.  
11
3In this analysis, we considered the Group perimeter, excluding the newly-acquired business of TOM FORD FASHION. 
4 The TCFD framework is a globally recognized risk-based model developed by the Financial Stability Board to evaluate the robustness and adaptability 
of corporate strategies in dealing with climate change.

Social
DIVERSITY, EQUITY & INCLUSION 
STRATEGY
Our diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I) strategy 
has evolved since its launch in 2022. Our approach 
is characterized by a desire to hear our people and 
to understand their unique needs. We believe that 
there is power and value in diversity, and that 
individuals should be seen and heard. An 
organization that treats its people with respect and 
dignity, and values them for their unique gifts, is 
stronger and more resilient.
Key Initiatives Executed in 2023:
• Our Board approved our DE&I policy; 
• We carried out a training on DE&I concepts, 
involving 87% of the Group’s employees, 
excluding the TOM FORD FASHION segment, 
both in-person and online;
• We created the "inclusion team”, a group of 
employees in Italy and Switzerland who 
volunteered to engage in DE&I projects. The 
team is responsible for identifying inclusion 
issues and designing initiatives to spread an 
inclusive culture within the Group;
• We approved new Group parental leave 
standards, according to which employees are 
entitled to a parental leave period of 6 weeks 
with full pay, equivalent to 30 working days. 
Where the local law is more favorable, no 
additional provisions apply. The corresponding 
policy was approved in the first quarter of 2024;
• We developed a talent acquisition and retention 
approach according to our DE&I strategy, which 
led to the release of a new recruiting procedure, 
with a standardized and transparent framework 
to attract, assess, and appoint qualified 
candidates. Furthermore, we publicly set a target 
of gender balance in top management positions;
• We have started on the path to obtaining the 
Italian Gender Equality Certification.
TALENT MANAGEMENT
In 2023, we introduced 2 projects that deserve 
special attention:
1. New leadership model: in response to our 
evolving strategic vision, we introduced a new 
leadership model. The initiative identifies key 
competencies and behaviors to empower our 
workforce to realize our objectives and achieve 
our vision.
2. JUMP! Graduate program: This one-year 
initiative offers a customized learning 
experience and development path, equipping 
participants with critical skills for inner growth. 
The pilot program, based at our Milan 
headquarters, encompasses three main areas: 
data science and digital; partnerships and 
“clienteling” (building customer relationships); 
and sustainability. 
In addition, in 2023, the ZEGNA brand engaged in 
various initiatives aimed at fostering awareness, 
involvement, and interest among students. These 
efforts included site-visits (we welcomed almost 
500 graduate and postgraduate students), 
attending career fairs, partnering with educational 
institutions (such as the Biella Master delle Fibre 
Nobili, and the MAFED program of SDA Bocconi), 
and focusing on strategies to enhance in-house 
expertise from the outset of careers.

GROUP ACADEMY
The Ermenegildo Zegna Group considers 
craftsmanship and innovation as being core to our 
learning processes and integral to our long-term 
growth strategy.
Starting with the ZEGNA brand, in 2023 we 
broadened the scope of the Group Academy 
project, to include the entire value chain (from 
industry to customer). We have formulated a new 
learning strategy based on four "skills factories", 
each dedicated to fostering expertise in distinct 
areas: industry, product, customer relations, 
innovation and leadership.
In 2023, the Group Academy devoted substantial 
efforts to training and skills development for 
manufacturing, aiming to attract specialized 
professionals, bridge the skills gap, identify and 
train young talent, and facilitate knowledge 
transfer among employees. The Group Academy is 
also dedicated to diversifying the workforce, 
expanding the talent pool for manufacturing 
facilities, and strengthening connections within 
territories where the Group operates.
In 2023, the Group Academy delivered 35,200 
training hours to 125 external candidates, 
compared to  13,205 hours delivered in 2022.
The Group Academy also fostered technical career 
orientation among young people, hosting 133 high 
school students at our plants in Italy and 
Switzerland, and signing a new learning partnership 
with a fashion high school in Parma, Italy.

Environment
Safeguarding the environment is one of our founding values and fundamental obligations. We continue to 
focus on reducing our environmental footprint and contributing to the renewable energy transition.
In 2023, we continued executing under such commitments by:
• Increasing the amount of electricity purchased from renewable sources, from 22% in 2021, to 46% in 2022, 
and to 68% in 2023; and
• Installing and activating two new photovoltaic systems at two of the Group's production sites;
Carbon emission reduction targets — SBTi submission
In 2022, the Ermenegildo Zegna Group committed to setting science-based emissions reduction targets, 
submitting our targets to the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi). In May 2023, the SBTi verified 
Ermenegildo Zegna N.V.’s net-zero (both near- and long-term) science-based targets by 2050.
Overall net-zero target
Ermenegildo Zegna N.V. commits to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the value chain by 2050 
from a 2021 base year.
Near-term targets
Ermenegildo Zegna N.V. commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50.4% by 2032 from a 
2021 base year.
Ermenegildo Zegna N.V. also commits to increase active annual sourcing of renewable electricity from 22% in 
2021 to 100% by 2027.
Ermenegildo Zegna N.V. further commits to reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions from purchased goods 
and services, fuel and energy-related activities, employee commuting, and investments by 50.4% by 2032 
from a 2021 base year5.
Long-term targets
Ermenegildo Zegna N.V commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 90% by 2050 from a 
2021 base year. Ermenegildo Zegna N.V also commits to reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions by 90% 
within the same time frame.
14
5 In 2024 the Group will submit  a renewed target proposal to the  Science-Based Targets initiative to reflect the change in the baseline due to the 
allocation of FLAG vs. non-FLAG targets and the acquisition of Tom Ford International LLC on April 28, 2023.

COLLECTIVE VIRTUAL POWER PURCHASE  
AGREEMENT 
As part of the Group’s commitment as a Signatory 
brand of The Fashion Pact, in December 2022 we 
announced our participation in the Collective 
Virtual Power Purchase Agreement (CVPPA). The 
CVPPA, linked to Lightsource BP’s solar portfolio in 
Spain, and finalized in October 2023, offers a long-
term renewables commitment for 12 brands.
This collective deal means that businesses with 
global responsibilities (but less intensive energy 
use) benefit from solar power; and underpin the 
development of new renewable energy projects. 
The Fashion Pact worked collaboratively with 
Lightsource BP’s Power Markets team to create a 
bespoke PPA structure that meets members’ needs 
and helps satisfy demand for renewable energy. 
This tailored and pragmatic approach saw the 
contract being agreed upon in only a few months, 
creating an equitable platform for the initiative’s 
members to accelerate their transition to clean 
energy. The CVPPA is an important step towards 
reducing our scope 2 emissions. Collective action is 
crucial to ensuring that we meet our sustainability 
goals; this project is one example of our willingness 
to cooperate with other brands to make meaningful 
changes. 
RE.CREA CONSORTIUM 
In 2022, the Group contributed to founding the 
Re.Crea consortium, an organization dedicated to 
promoting sustainability in the fashion and textile 
industries and coordinated by the CNMI (the 
National Chamber of Italian Fashion). Its goal is to 
manage the end-of-life phase of textile and fashion 
products, and to promote the research and 
development of innovative recycling solutions. 
ZDHC ROADMAP TO ZERO PROGRAMME  
As of January1, 2024, the Group is now a Signatory 
of the ZDHC Roadmap to Zero Programme, 
adopting the ZDHC Brands to Zero commitment for 
the use of chemical substances.6  
Brands to Zero provides brands and retailers with a 
harmonized approach and a clear path to achieving 
sustainable chemical management in their own 
productions and throughout their supply 
chain. Brands to Zero allows for performance 
comparability through annual assessments. 
In 2023, the Group’s internal manufacturing sites  
achieved the ZDHC Foundational compliance level, 
joining Bonotto, Dondi, Tessitura Ubertino, and the 
Lanificio Ermenegildo Zegna in this achievement.
BIODIVERSITY
On 24 November 2023, ZEGNA was announced as 
the official partner of the City of Milan for the 
redesign and care of the flowerbeds in Piazza 
Duomo for the next three years. ZEGNA has 
worked with a group of botanical and landscape 
experts to bring some of the iconic elements of Oasi 
Zegna's vegetation to Milan (in keeping with 
ecological best practices). This project will create a 
green space in the center of the city, inspired by the 
Oasi Zegna philosophy of environmental 
responsibility. Oasi Zegna is a 100 km 2 nature 
reserve located in the Biellese Alps in Piedmont, 
established  by Ermenegildo Zegna at the beginning 
of the previous  century, as a unique model of social 
and environmental awareness.

OASI CASHMERE & OASI LINO
The Oasi Cashmere collection was introduced for 
the first time in 2022 and presented as  “Born in 
Oasi Zegna”. The aim is for the collection to be 
made from 100% certified traceable cashmere fiber 
by 2024. The collection is named after, and inspired 
by, the home of our values — Oasi Zegna — a 
thriving 100 km2 ecosystem that has been nurtured 
by the Group over generations. 
The color selection reflects the warm and earthy 
autumn foliage of Oasi Zegna, and it offers a vast 
array of garments: e.g. the iconic over-shirt, extra-
fine knitwear, trousers, and accessories. 
Oasi Cashmere is a trademark of traceability and 
accountability. Through Oasi Cashmere, our goal is 
to promote values such as safeguarding the natural 
environment, contributing to communities, and 
ethical sourcing of raw materials.
The Oasi Lino collection, like Oasi Cashmere, 
embodies our values of authenticity, craftsmanship 
and high quality. Foremost, it guarantees the 
traceability of the fiber from its country of origin to 
the manufacturing site. 
Linen is a natural fiber, coming from the flax plant. 
Top quality linen comes from flax grown mainly in 
Normandy, France, with its blue flowers that bloom 
for just a single day in early summer. Our traceable 
linen comes from two different certifications: 
European Flax ® and Masters of Linen ®. Both 
guarantee that the fiber comes from European 
sources and that the material is traceable to the 
fabric mill. By 2024, all linen fibers contained in the 
Oasi Lino collection will be 100% traceable.
