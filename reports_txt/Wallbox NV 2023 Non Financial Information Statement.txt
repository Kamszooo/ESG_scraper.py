What We Provide to Others
By the end of 2023, we had connected 
more than 800,000 chargers around 
the world. That massive network 
generates huge amounts of data, which 
we leverage and share to further refine 
and develop technologies that reduce 
utility grid burden and increase use of 
renewable sources. 
Quasar 2
The second generation of our indus -
try’s first bi-directional charger made 
huge headlines in 2023. Household 
names including Europe’s Cupra and 
Kia North America have joined us in our 
vision of shifting the electric vehicle 
from only a mode of efficient trans -
portation, to an energy storage asset. 
In July, Wallbox became a signatory 
to the U.S. Department of Energy’s 
Vehicle to Everything Memorandum of 
Understanding, joining the industry’s 
push for vehicle to everything (V2X) 
technology integration. In November, 
Wallbox and Bidirectional Energy were 
selected by the California Energy 
Commission for proposed awards to 
deploy V2X chargers across California. 
These proof points highlight the desire 
for creative solutions today that will 
allow us to better manage the needs 
of EV drivers tomorrow.
ENERGY STAR
In June, Wallbox released its  first 
Energy Star residential charger. 
Developed and administered by the 
United States Environmental Protec-
tion Agency (EPA), ENERGY STAR is a 
government-backed symbol for energy 
efficiency. The blue ENERGY STAR 
label provides simple, credible, and 
unbiased information that consumers, 
businesses, and government agencies 
rely on to make informed decisions 
when purchasing appliances and elec-
tronics. The certification will provide 
added brand confidence to Wallbox, 
with recent data showing that 68% of 
consumers knowingly purchased an 
ENERGY STAR certified product this 
past year.
SIRIUS
This is our proprietary energy 
management system designed for 
our Barcelona HQ. It brings together 
renewable sources, storage, our 
industry's first bidirectional charger, 
and EVs, all in a comprehensive solution 
that saves money, reduces grid loads, 
and increases independence. T o date, 
we’ve generated and consumed about 
800,000KWh of solar energy in 2023.
We are proud of what we’ve achieved 
and excited about what is to come. We 
are in a unique position to contribute 
meaningfully in how the world evolves 
and embraces more responsible and 
efficient modes of transportation. In 
2024, our primary focus lies in the 
continuous enhancement of Wallbox's 
environmental, social, and governance 
practices, alongside the measurement 
and quantification of key performance 
indicators (KPIs) and maintaining a 
transparent value chain.
We look forward to sharing our prog-
ress. We remain open and collaborative 
in how we approach these themes and 
objectives and welcome shareholder 
feedback. Thank you for your contin-
ued support.  
With best regards,
Enric Asuncion
CEO & Co-Founder
Wallbox began in 2015 with a mission 
to accelerate EV adoption by making 
EV charging more accessible to drivers, 
both at home and on the go. By bringing 
together sophisticated hardware with 
intelligent software, a new energy 
management architecture could be 
offered to the world. That solution 
would allow us to make better deci -
sions about how, where, and when to 
charge our vehicles, power our homes 
and businesses, and even support the 
power grid. It would introduce new 
ways of looking at utility providers. It 
would allow homeowners to harness 
renewable sources, store that energy 
in batteries parked in our garage, and 
use or even return that energy back 
to others during peak load times. This 
in-turn has the potential to drastically 
change how the world invests in power 
generation and distribution. Indepen-
dent. Resilient. Efficient. Intelligent. 
Sustainable. This was what we were 
born from, and 2023 brought us so 
much closer to that goal.         
The global market share of battery 
electric vehicles at the end of 2023 
was approximately 14.5%. Adoption 
on a country by country basis varies 
widely, with Norway at 80%, China 
at 24%, and the US at 8%. Adoption 
continues to occur at a blistering 
pace, and is expected to cross 20% 
in 2026. However you parse the data, 
consumers are, for the first time in 
history, moving away from internal 
combustion vehicles and fossil fuels, 
to a more sustainable future. 
In addition to sweeping changes to how 
we think and use transportation and 
energy, this dramatic shift of consumer 
preferences has potentially drastic 
impacts on our public infrastructures. 
Wallbox has established itself as a 
steward of this new reality, both in 
how we conduct ourselves, and what 
we enable our customers to achieve.    
What We Do Ourselves
Environmental
As part of the Net Zero commitment, 
we have installed thousands of solar 
panels at our corporate headquarters 
and Barcelona factory, which in-turn 
have allowed us to more than double 
our mix of renewable energy at our 
facilities. We’ve implemented circular 
practices, including “cradle to cradle” 
methodologies, at our most populated 
facilities. 
Social
We’ve implemented a new Learning 
Management System titled My Power-
Box, which is designed to improve 
collaboration and transparency, further 
increasing inclusion and broadening 
our view of the world in which our 
stakeholders operate in. Through this 
innovative system and initiative, we’ve 
trained 143 employees on Unconscious 
Bias. We’ve also launched a unique 
Diversity and Inclusion program to 
create growth opportunities for the 
women at Wallbox. We also released a 
new and improved internal feedback 
tool called Wallbox Voice, enabling 
all Wallboxers to share feedback 
confidentially. 
Governance
In 2023, we developed a Human Rights 
Policy, which formally expresses our 
commitment to human rights recog -
nized in national and international 
legislations and to conduct  business 
in a manner that respects the dignity, 
health, safety, and fundamental free-
doms of all individuals.

ACCELERATING 
CHANGE FOR THE 
BETTER
01. First Chapter Accelerating change 
for the better
Over the last 12 months Wallbox has 
remained committed to environmental, 
social, and governance principles, recog-
nizing the pivotal role electric vehicles 
play in shaping a sustainable future. As 
the world grapples with the urgent need to 
combat climate change, Wallbox continues 
the charge in accelerating the transition 
to e-mobility through innovative charging 
and energy solutions. With a keen focus on 
reducing carbon emissions and promoting 
renewable energy consumption, Wallbox’s 
mission is inherently ESG-centric, aligning 
closely with the company’s core values 
and strategic objectives. Amidst growing 
global interest and scrutiny surrounding 
ESG practices, Wallbox remains dedicated 
to enhancing its sustainability initiatives, 
fostering a culture of transparency, 
accountability, and continuous improve -
ment across all facets of its operations.
In 2023, Wallbox: 
Strengthened ESG practices
Since its IPO two years ago, Wallbox has 
taken important steps to consolidate all 
ESG-related activities into ESG-related 
company departments and the Nominating 
and Corporate Governance Committee. 
This strategic move has enabled Wallbox 
to concentrate its efforts on areas where 
it can make a tangible difference, both 
internally and externally. Over the past 
two years, the company has achieved 
remarkable milestones, from implementing 
an intelligent energy management system 
Committed to Net-Zero Emissions 
by 2030
Recognizing the urgency of climate 
change, Wallbox has set an ambitious 
target to achieve net-zero emissions by 
2030, surpassing industry standards. 
Through our solar panels, Power Purchase 
Agreement (PPA), accurate measurement, 
and internal emission reduction initiatives 
and chaging all the energy contracts to 
one single energy provider, the company 
is actively working to mitigate our environ-
mental footprint.
DRIVING POSITIVE CHANGE 
FORWARD 
Wallbox Values
Dare
We dare to envision a better way of 
doing things, to have bold ambitions 
and adventurous plans. We dare to 
be curious, to stretch ourselves and 
grow. We dare as individuals, but 
more than that, together as a team, 
as a company.
Drive
We have meaning behind what we do 
- we are deliberate in our choices and 
we own them. We are proactive, not 
passive, we choose to lead change 
and not lag behind it. We demand 
the best from ourselves, take on the 
challenges, put in the effort and own 
our impact.
Different
We imagine alternatives and inspire a 
better way. We have critical thinking. 
We question, we challenge and our 
views mean we will swim against 
the current at times. In working and 
collaborating, we value being close 
and being different.
at the headquarters in Barcelona, to the net 
zero commitment.
Fostered a culture of transparency and 
compliance 
Wallbox recognizes the importance of 
transparency and regulatory compliance, 
and the company regularly conducts peer 
analyses and industry benchmarking exer-
cises. By implementing robust reporting, 
promoting open communication channels, 
and prioritizing adherence to regulatory 
standards, the company cultivates an envi-
ronment where integrity and accountability 
are paramount. This dedication to trans -
parency and compliance not only enhances 
stakeholder trust but also strengthens our 
foundation for sustainable growth and 
ethical business practices.
Advanced sustainable solutions
At Wallbox, the focus extends beyond 
merely producing chargers to creating 
smart charging solutions that add value 
to both consumers and the environment. 
The company’s diverse range of charging 
products, including residential, commer -
cial, and public chargers, are designed to 
offer efficient and convenient charging 
options for EV owners. Over the last 12 
months, Wallbox expanded its range of 
advanced charging solutions, introducing 
new additions to the Pulsar Family and 
beyond. With charging options tailored for 
residential, commercial, and public use, 
Wallbox has a solution for each and every 
charging need. By providing efficient and 
convenient charging options, we have 
accelerated the adoption of sustainable 
transportation worldwide. This included 
the launch of the Wallbox’s Quasar 2, a first-
of-its-kind DC charger that represents a 
significant breakthrough in home charging 
technology. Quasar 2 allows EV drivers not 
only to charge their vehicles but also to 
discharge energy back into their homes or 
the grid. That means users can charge their 
vehicles and harness energy for various 
purposes, contributing to grid stability 
and energy optimization. This innovation 
enhances energy flexibility, resilience, and 
cost-effectiveness, driving Wallbox closer 
to a sustainable energy ecosystem. 
Embraced circularity initiatives
Wallbox aims to increasingly prioritize 
circular practices, with a particular 
emphasis on waste reduction, material 
reuse, and component recycling. From 
digitizing product guides to implementing 
cradle-to-cradle certification, we strive 
to maximize resource efficiency and mini-
mize our ecological footprint. Wallbox’s 
commitment to ESG is deeply embedded 
in its corporate strategy and Wallbox strives 
to uphold high standards of environmental 
stewardship, social responsibility, and 
corporate governance.

02. Second Chapter
During 2023, Wallbox has elected 2 new 
Board Members which have broad experi-
ence in both the company’s industry as well 
as environmental, social, and governance 
expertise. As of December 2023, about 
40% of the company’s BoD members had 
professional experience and capabilities in 
ESG topics. Moreover, on an annual basis, 
the Board is evaluated based on an inde -
pendent self-assessment that complies 
with US and Dutch regulations. Additionally, 
the annual shareholders meeting evaluates 
and approves the management of the 
Board.
Wallbox is proud to introduce its most 
recently joined members:
Dr. Dieter Zetsche
Dr. Zetsche serves as a member of the 
board at Wallbox. Dr. Zetsche is Chairman 
of TUI AG and holds several other board 
positions both as a member and advisor. 
With over 45 years of automotive experi -
ence, first joining the research department 
of Daimler-Benz AG in 1976, Dr. Zetsche 
brings unrivaled industry expertise to Wall-
box as the company continues to expand 
partnerships with leading OEMs globally. 
Notably Dr. Zetsche has been a member of 
the Board of Management of Daimler AG 
since December 1998 and was Chairman 
of the Board of Management of Daimler AG 
from January 2006 until May 2019, during 
which he was also Head of Mercedes-Benz 
Cars.
The Board is composed 
by the following members:
Justin Mirro
Mr. Mirro serves as a member of the board 
at Wallbox. Mr. Mirro is the Founder and 
President of Kensington Capital Partners 
LLC, has advised on over $70 billion of M&A, 
debt, equity and restructuring transactions 
for automotive assemblers, suppliers, the 
aftermarket and dealerships. Mr. Mirro 
spent almost 20 years as an automotive 
investment banker for various global 
banks including The Royal Bank of Canada, 
Jefferies & Company, Moelis & Company 
and Salomon Smith Barney. He also brings 
a vast personal network of industry lead -
ers throughout the automotive supply 
chain which will assist as Wallbox further 
expands in North America operationally 
and with institutional investors. Mr. Mirro 
is a member of the board of Amprius T ech-
nologies and a former member of the board 
of Quantumscape.
By the end of 2023, the Board has three 
different committees: the Audit commit-
tee, the Compensations Committee and 
the Nominating and Corporate Gover-
nance Committee which is responsible 
for overseeing the ESG strategy and 
annual approval of the Non-Financial 
Report.

Statement 2023
02. Second Chapter
Wallbox has established a comprehen-
sive framework to manage its impacts 
and opportunities, which consists of 
three primary areas, accompanied by 
assessment matrices and strategies 
for mitigation4.
Compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act (SOX) is vital for Wallbox to imple-
ment controls related to fraud, bribery, 
and money laundering. The Company 
has developed the risk matrix and imple-
mented the SOX controls, designating 
relevant procedures, systems, and 
control responsibles. By 2025, Wallbox 
is obligated to be fully SOX compliant.
Operational impacts and opportunities 
pertain to the daily functions across 
various departments, including procure-
ment, logistics, manufacturing, contin-
uous improvement, quality assurance, 
finance, sales, and health, safety, and 
environmental practices.
Environmental, Social, and Governance 
(ESG) impacts align with recommenda-
tions from the T ask Force on Climate-Re-
lated Disclosure (TCFD) and comply 
with proposed regulations by the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC) for publicly listed companies on 
the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). 
Moreover, Wallbox has categorized its 
ESG into seven main impact areas, in line 
with the TCFD methodology: 
 • Reputational
 • Policy and Legal
 • Financial
 • Market
 • Physical
 • T echnological
 • Operational
Wallbox complies with both national 
and international regulations and has a 
proactive approach towards upcoming 
social, environmental, and governance 
laws. Aside from the SEC proposed 
regulation, Wallbox also complies with 
the Law 11/2018 of December 28, on 
non-financial information and diversity 
as well as the EU T axonomy regulation.
4. Please see Form 20-F submitted to the U.S. Secu-
rities and Exchange Commission with respect to the 
year ended December 31, 2023 for a detailed descrip-
tion of key Wallbox impacts, and opportunities.
The EU taxonomy serves as a fundamen-
tal element within the EU’s sustainable 
finance framework, functioning as a key 
tool for enhancing market transparency. 
By guiding investments towards essen-
tial economic activities crucial for the 
transition, it aligns with the objectives 
of the European Green Deal. This clas-
sification system establishes criteria 
for identifying economic activities that 
adhere to a net zero trajectory by 2050,

has worked on different projects to be able 
to be EU T axonomy eligible and aligned 
and receive sustainable financing. Wallbox 
received more than 50 million euros in 
green financing and worked on more than 
5 different alignment projects:

EINF. Non-Financial Information  
Statement 2023
02. Second Chapter Driving ESG Leadership
On June 27 , 2023, the Commission 
introduced a T axonomy Environmental 
Delegated Act, incorporating new environ-
mental objectives and EU taxonomy criteria 
aimed at identifying economic activities 
that significantly contribute to one or more 
non-climate environmental objectives. 
These objectives encompass the sustain-
able management and safeguarding of 
water and marine resources, the transition 
towards a circular economy, measures for 
pollution prevention and control, and initia-
tives for the protection and restoration of 
biodiversity and ecosystems.
1. Methodology Approach
As a first step, Wallbox is obligated to report 
the degree of activities associated with 
sustainability environmental economic 
activities according to the sustainability 
criteria set out in the EU Regulations 
2021/2139, 2022/1214, 2023/2485 and 
2023/2486.
The company has concluded that 100% of 
its activities are eligible under the following 
three Climate Change Mitigation T axonomy 
activities:
• 3.6 Manufacture of other low carbon 
technologies
• 7.4 Installation, maintenance, and 
repair of charging stations for elec-
tric vehicles in buildings (and parking 
spaces attached to buildings)
• 8.2 Data-driven solutions for GHG 
emissions reductions
The second step is to assess how each 
activity does or does not meet the 
following alignment criteria:
Contribute substantially to one or more of 
the environmental objectives: an activity 
must substantially contribute to climate 
change mitigation, climate change adap-
tation, safeguarding of water and marine 
resources, the transition towards a 
circular economy, measures for pollution 
prevention and control, and initiatives 
for the protection and restoration of 
biodiversity and ecosystems. Moreover, 
there are two sub-classifications within 
Climate Change:
• Transition Activities: activities 
for which there are not tech -
nologically and economically 
feasible low-carbon alternatives, 
but that support the transition to 
a climate neutral economy in a 
manner that is consistent with a 
pathway to limit the temperature 
increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius 
above pre-industrial levels.
• Enabling activities: activities 
that enable other activities to 
make a substantial contribution 
to one or more of the objectives, 
and where that activity: i) does 
not lead to a lock-in in assets 
that undermine long-term envi-
ronmental goals, considering 
the economic lifetime of those 
assets; ii) has a substantial posi-
tive environmental impact based 
on life-cycle consideration.
Wallbox has calculated and assessed 
compliance with substantial contribution 
to an environmental objective which is 
climate change mitigation for the eligible 
economic activities:
• 3.6 Manufacture of other low 
carbon technologies
• 7.4 Installation, maintenance, 
and repair of charging stations 
for electric vehicles in buildings 
(and parking spaces attached to 
buildings)
• 8.2 Data-driven solutions for GHG 
emissions reductions
As a third step, the EU T axonomy mandates 
the analysis of “Do No Significant Harm 
(DNSH)” which requires that the activity 
must not significantly harm the other five 
objectives described above. For each of the 
five objectives, specific criteria are set that 
precisely define what it means not to do any 
significant harm.
As the last step, to calculate the eligibil -
ity and alignment of the EU T axonomy 
economic activities within Wallbox, there 
is one last evaluation about the minimum 
social safeguards and with special focus 
on the topic of Human Rights. These 
safeguards relate to the OECD Guidelines 
for Multinational Enterprises, UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights 
and Principles and Rights of the Interna -
tional Labor Organization on Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work.
In summary, each Wallbox activity stated 
contributes to climate change mitigation 
activities, does no significant harm to the 
environment, and has sufficient social 
safeguards. For more detail on steps two 
to four, please see Appendix II.
2. Calculation of the eligibility and 
alignment and results
Calculation of the turnover percentage 
ratio for Wallbox N.V. eligibility ratio calcu-
lation, the company has considered the 
following criteria:
• Numerator: total turnover from 
eligible activities (Group 70w of the 
General Accounting Plan) includes 
the activities of Wallbox as a manu-
facturer of chargers for EVs, as well 
as the activities from Electromaps, 
Coil Inc., and Ares Electronics.
• Denominator: total turnover from 
Wallbox N.V.
Calculation of the CapEx percentage ratio 
For Wallbox N.V. eligibility ratio calculation, 
the company has considered the following 
criteria:
• Numerator: CapEx aggregation, 
according to the International Finan-
cial Reporting Standards (IFRS/NIIF), 
of eligible activities which includes 
the activities of Wallbox as a manu-
facturer of chargers for EVs, as well 
as the activities from Electromaps, 
Coil Inc., and Ares Electronics.

and its industry-specific frameworks as 
a foundation for their initial ESG materi-
ality assessment. They consulted with 
stakeholders on environmental, social, 
and governance topics. Recognizing the 
need for broader analysis, during 2024, 
Wallbox will be refining its assessment 
to incorporate a double materiality

Wallbox plays a crucial role in support-
ing the transition to electric transport 
through our innovative charging and 
energy solutions. It is important to note 
that Wallbox focuses on creating smart 
chargers that provide value to our end 
customer and the environment. More -
over, the core strategy and charging 
solutions of Wallbox are intrinsically 
linked to reducing carbon emissions 
and accelerating the consumption of 
renewable energy.
The environmental framework is 
comprised of 3 main variables:
• “Operational inputs” are the inflows 
of the company including materials, 
packaging, and transportation.
• “Product outputs” are the outflow 
activities, after the production phase 
until the end-of-life of the product.
• “Measuring Wallbox Impact” 
includes the externalities from 
“Doing-Business-as-Usual”
The environmental framework of 
Wallbox is influenced by both internal 
and external policies and certifications, 
aiding the company in maintaining 
compliance and moving towards adopt-
ing industry best practices.
The internal policies are owned by 
each specific area and department of 
Wallbox whose responsibility falls under. 
However, policies apply to the entire 
organization and into organizational 
strategies, operations, and procedures.

In 2023, Wallbox, recognizing the 
imperative of climate resilience and 
sustainability, undertook a compre -
hensive climate impact assessment 
for its manufacturing facility situated 
in Arlington. Guided by industry-lead-
ing frameworks such as the T ask Force 
on Climate-related Financial Disclo -
sures (TCFD), Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, 
scientific peer reviews, and the EU 
T axonomy, the company embarked on 
a meticulous evaluation process. This 
involved a series of structured steps 
to ensure a thorough understanding 
of potential impacts and their implica-
tions. Initially, the activity underwent a 
rigorous screening process to identify 
physical climate effects. Subsequently, 
a detailed climate footprint and vulner-
ability assessment was conducted to 
gauge the materiality of Wallbox's 
economic activities. Armed with this 
knowledge, the company diligently 
explored adaptation solutions aimed 
at mitigating identified physical 
climate impacts. This included an 
examination of various strategies 
to enhance resilience and minimise 
potential disruptions. Finally, drawing 
upon the insights gathered, Wallbox 
formulated a comprehensive climate 
adaptation plan. This plan outlined 
actionable steps to address the most 
significant effects of climate, thereby 
fortifying the company's ability to 
navigate climate-related challenges 
while reaffirming its importance to 
the environment. In summary, Wallbox 
undertook the following steps:
As Wallbox charts its course towards a 
more sustainable future, the company 
acknowledges the importance of 
transitioning towards a circular 
economy model. Wallbox recognizes 
the imperative to rethink conven -
tional approaches to production and 
consumption, steering away from the 
linear 'take-make-dispose' paradigm 
towards one that prioritizes resource 
efficiency and waste reduction. With 
a commitment to cultivating a culture 
of sustainability that permeates the 
business, Wallbox is actively exploring 
opportunities to integrate circular 
principles into its operations.
In this section, the focus will be on Wall-
box's preliminary efforts to embrace 
elements of the circular economy, 
including the exploration of the 3R 
model – Reduce, Reuse, Recycle – and 
the steps taken to conduct Life Cycle 
Assessments of Wallbox products.

cycle stages of the products, ensuring 
a holistic understanding of their envi-
ronmental footprint.
Key Results:
 ● 
T otal Impact for Supernova LCA: 60.8 
tonnes of CO2 equivalent which is 
about 8 homes’ energy use for 1 year6.
T otal Impact for Quasar LCA: 3.5 
tonnes of CO2 equivalent which is 
about 0.5 home’s energy use for 1 year.
Phase Analysis: Between 84% and 
94% of the total greenhouse gas emis-
sions are attributed to the use phase 
of the chargers. The materials phase 
accounts for almost all the remaining 
impact, representing between 5% 
and 15% of the total greenhouse gas 
emissions.
By conducting these LCAs and analyz-
ing the environmental impacts of the 
products in detail, Wallbox is better 
equipped to implement strategies 
for sustainable design, production, 
and end-of-life management. These 
efforts are aligned with the company’s 
approach to advancing the principles 
of circular economy and minimizing our 
environmental footprint.
5. Impact Assessment Method: The LCAs focused on 
the Climate Change impact category, utilizing the IPCC 
2021 GWP100 V1.01 method. This approach provided 
insights into the chargers' contribution to greenhouse 
gas emissions over their entire life cycle.

In our pursuit of sustainability and 
environmental stewardship, Wallbox 
has undertaken a rigorous examination 
of the environmental impact of Wallbox 
products through the implementation 
of Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs). 
These assessments serve as a funda-
mental tool to understand, quantify, 
and mitigate the environmental 
footprint along the value chain.
LCAs provide a holistic perspective, 
analyzing the entire life cycle of a 
product from cradle to grave. By 
encompassing each stage, from raw 
material extraction and production 
to distribution, use, and disposal, the 
company gains valuable insights into 
the resource consumption, emissions, 
and potential environmental impacts 
associated with our products.
LCAs for Supernova & Quasar
Wallbox presents the results of the 
Life Cycle Assessment conducted 
for two of our latest innovations, the

characterizing, managing, and measuring, 
the passport also serves to:
• Enhance management capacity 
concerning regulatory changes (e.g., 
waste regulations, material toxicity).
• Facilitate future value recovery by 
defining recyclability pathways in the 
passport.
• Contribute to positioning and non-fi-
nancial reporting.
 
2. Circular Signature:
The Signature quantifies the environmen-
tal, social, and economic impacts of the 
project using indicators aligned with the 
Circular Passport. It provides crucial data 
including:
• Composition of material types and 
creation of material passports based 
on technical documents.
• Material health assessment, identi -
fying toxicity and health effects to 
people and the environment.
• Circularity evaluation, considering 
material or product origins, inclusion 
of recycled materials, future potential, 
and maximum recyclability.
• Environmental impact analysis, includ-
ing carbon and water footprints.
Implementing circular principles in the 
renovation of Wallbox's HQ offices and 
cafeteria not only aligns with sustainabil-
ity goals but also enhances opportunity 
management, facilitates future resource 
recovery, and strengthens non-financial 
reporting practices.
3. Wallbox Circular Headquarters:
• Modular Design: The circular spaces 
are designed with a modular approach, 
making them easily disassembled for 
upgrades and reconfigurations. This 
design feature simplifies material 
recovery while reducing inefficiencies, 
costs, and renovation time.
• Circular Products and Materials: Wall-
box prioritises the use of sustainable 
products and materials in its circular 
spaces. These include products 
designed for disassembly, safety, and 
health, ideally certified by Cradle to 
Cradle Certified®.
• Traceability: Every product installed 
in the spaces undergoes meticulous 
identification, location, and tracing 
throughout its lifecycle. This ensures 
the maintenance and recovery of their 
About 40% of energy consumption in 
the EU stems from the construction 
sector, contributing up to 36% of the 
region’s CO2 emissions. Furthermore, 
construction activities generate 60% 
of the EU's total waste.
Because of the significant impact that 
construction has on the environment, 
Wallbox performed a circular diagnosis 
of its headquarters in Barcelona, and 
in 2023 did the same diagnosis with 
its canteen. The main results from the 
analysis were the following:
The 6 main procedures and levels of 
analysis were the following:

Wallbox recognizes the fundamental 
importance of water as a vital resource 
and is dedicated to its preservation 
and responsible use. Given the grow-
ing concerns arising from the effects 
of climate change, the company 
values the importance of conserving 
this resource even more. However, it 
is important to note that, while the 
company considers water a critical 
resource, it is not a material factor in 
its operations; Wallbox's production 
process does not require significant 
water consumption, and its usage is 
primarily limited to hygienic purposes 
for employees and in the company's 
cantina. Nevertheless, the company 
maintains a proactive approach to 
sustainable water management in all 
its business activities7.
Wallbox acknowledges the notable 
increase in water consumption, stem -
ming from the impactful developments 
of 2023: the successful acquisition of 
ABL, the first complete year of oper -
ations in the Barcelona and Arlington 
factories, and the revitalization of the St. 
Andreu facility in the initial four months 
of the year. Despite the surge in water 
usage, escalating from 12,463 m3 to 
67, 775 m3, Wallbox has taken proactive 
steps to address this trend. Through the 
strategic implementation of filtration 
systems across sinks and washbasins at 
both the Wallbox headquarters and the 
D26 factory, the technology is supposed 
to reduce 20% in water consumption.
Wallbox conducts a thorough analyses 
not only of its water consumption but 
also to understand the adverse effects 
arising from natural disasters. Accord-
ing to data provided by the Institute 
of Economics and Peace 8, there has 
been a notable global escalation in

facilities.

Water natural disaster occurrences, with 
incidents rising from 39 in 1960 to 396 
in 2019; notably, flooding emerges as the 
predominant natural hazard.
Furthermore, T exas has garnered recog-
nition from NASA9 as the foremost U.S. 
state in terms of both the diversity and 
frequency of natural disasters. In light 
of this acknowledgment, Wallbox has 
embarked upon a series of initiatives 
pertaining to its facility situated in Arling-
ton, T exas. These initiatives encompass 
a comprehensive evaluation of flood 
probability, identified as the primary 
concern for the region, along with other 
potential natural impacts:
The following impacts were identified:
Changes in Precipitation Patterns and 
Extreme Variability in Weather Patterns:
• This poses challenges to Wallbox's 
operations as it can lead to unpre -
dictability in water availability for 
manufacturing processes and facility 
operations.
• The variability in weather patterns 
also introduces uncertainty regarding 
energy consumption, as extreme 
temperatures may require additional 
heating or cooling resources to main-
tain optimal working conditions within 
the facility.

Increased Inland Flooding:
• Inland flooding presents an effect to 
Wallbox's operations, particularly in 
low-lying areas or regions prone to 
heavy rainfall events. Floodwaters can 
cause damage to equipment, inven -
tory, and infrastructure. Additionally, 
prolonged flooding may result in 
extended production downtime and 
supply chain disruptions, impact -
ing the company's ability to meet 
customer demand and fulfill orders.
Heavy Precipitation and Pluvial 
Flooding:
• Heavy precipitation events and 
pluvial flooding pose specific impacts 
to Wallbox's operations, particularly 
in urban environments with limited 
drainage capacity. Intense rainfall can 
overwhelm storm-water systems, 
leading to localized flooding and 
water accumulation within the facility 
and surrounding areas. This can 
result in property damage, logistical 
disruptions, and safety hazards for 
employees and nearby communities.
• Pluvial flooding may also impact 
transportation routes and access to 
the facility, hindering the movement of 
goods and personnel. Moreover, water 
infiltration into the facility can damage 
critical infrastructure and compromise 
electrical systems, posing effects of 
equipment failure and operational 
downtime.

At Wallbox, we recognize the critical 
importance of biodiversity conserva-
tion and in preserving the health and 
resilience of our planet's ecosystems. 
Our responsibility to biodiversity aligns 
with the objectives outlined in Spain's 
non-financial information disclosure 
legislation, as we strive to uphold ethical 
and sustainable business practices that 
minimize our environmental footprint 
and contribute to global conservation 
efforts.
Wallbox, with an international presence 
of sales extending to more than 118 
countries, conducted a comprehen -
sive analysis focusing on the top 20 
countries where significant sales trans-
actions were generated. This analysis 
involved cross-referencing sales data 
with the Environmental Performance 
Index (EPI): Biodiversity Habitat Index10. 
Led by Yale University, the EPI Index 
provides a detailed assessment of over 
177 countries, utilizing remote sensing 
data and ecological diversity studies 
to estimate the impacts of habitat loss, 
degradation, and fragmentation on 
terrestrial biodiversity retention.
The EPI Index assigns a score ranging 
from 0 to 100, with a score of 100 indi-
cating no habitat loss or degradation 
and a score of 0 indicating complete 
habitat loss. This meticulous analysis 
enables Wallbox to gain insights into the 
biodiversity and habitat preservation 
efforts of countries where its operations 
are significant, facilitating informed 
decision-making and strategic plan -
ning in alignment with the company's 
environmental sustainability practices.
The EPI Index for Wallbox’s top 20 
countries with the highest number of 
sales transactions is as shown opposite. 
Wallbox took a close look for the compa-
ny’s top 2 countries with biodiversity 
loss: T urkey and Saudi Arabia. T o do so, 
the company analyzed other indexes 
that have a direct correlation with biodi-
versity. Wallbox will keep periodic track 
of the above data, analyze its evolution, 
and try not to do significant biodiversity 
harm when doing business in countries 
where it operates.

different D&I actions to advance towards 
its 3 main goals:
1. Attract & Grow
Achieve a better gender balance
In 2023, Wallbox implemented various 
initiatives aimed at narrowing the gender 
gap within the organization. Specifically, 
efforts were made to attract and retain 
more female talent by adapting and refining 
recruiting practices to be more women 
friendly. As a result of these initiatives, 
there was an increase in the number of 
female employees compared to the previ-
ous year, as evidenced by the table below:
As a result, there was a 28% increase in 
the total number of female employees 
compared to 2022.
Wallbox also boasts a diverse workforce 
spanning various age demographics, 
characterized by a normal distribution. The 
majority of employees fall within the age 
range of 30 to 45 years old, representing 
the 56% predominant cohort within the 
organization. Approximately 20% of the 
workforce comprises individuals under 
the age of 30, thereby facilitating ample 
employment opportunities for young 
professionals within the company. The

2. Drive Awareness
Ensure respectful culture & environment 
Wallbox11 underscores its proactive 
approach in cultivating a workplace 
where respect is paramount and every 
individual feels valued and empowered. 
Wallbox has taken deliberate steps to 
foster an environment characterized by 
mutual respect, dignity, and inclusivity12.
The first step has been to launch a 
program to drive Unconscious Bias 
awareness within our employees. This 
program aimed at identifying our bias 
and discuss in small groups ways to 
reduce or eliminate their impact in our 
decisions.
Additionally, the company has included 
its commitment to a Respect and Inclu-
sion in its new Code of Conduct and 
Ethics addressing its zero tolerance to 
inappropriate or disrespectful behav -
iors, as well as disciplinary regimes, 
within its policies and procedures. These 
resources serve as guides for promot-
ing a culture of inclusivity, addressing 
potential issues, and enforcing conse -
quences for behavior that falls short of 
Wallbox's values and expectations.
Moreover, Wallbox has established a 
Confidential Ethics Channel, providing 
a confidential platform to report any 
issues, including harassment, disrespect 
or misconduct, within the company. This 
initiative ensures that concerns are 
addressed promptly and appropriately, 
reinforcing Wallbox's efforts to uphold 
the highest standards of ethical conduct 
and accountability. Wallbox encourages 
anyone (including employees, business 
partners, customers, consumers and 
others) to report any unethical conduct 
or situation using the confidential Ethics 
Channel. You can access this channel 
through the following link.
11. There has been no incidents of discrimination.

and universal accessibility of persons with
special abilities throughout its offices and

FemForward Program, a significant 
initiative within the company's Diversity 
& Inclusion Plan. FemForward focuses 
on developing leadership skills, expand-
ing career growth opportunities, and 
establishing a robust support network 
for female colleagues.
 
We want to provide tools, 
resources and networks to 
Wallbox’s top female talent 
to grow and reach leader-
ship positions, addressing 
barriers, sharing successful 
experiences and growing 
our skills together to enable

evidenced by the recent certification of 
both manufacturing facilities in Barce-
lona and Arlington with ISO 45001, the

nized framework aimed at enhancing 
workplace safety, minimizing occupa -
tional hazards, and promoting overall

healthy work environment for employ-
ees, contractors, and visitors alike.

dents, injuries, and illnesses. Through

fication, impact assessment, and control 
measures, Wallbox ensures proactive

ABL Integration
In a pivotal move marking a significant 
milestone for Wallbox in 2023, the 
company integrated the renowned 
German enterprise, ABL, during the 
final quarter of the year. This strategic 
acquisition of ABL GmbH's operations 
and assets not only bolsters Wallbox's 
competitive stance in crucial markets 
but also expedites its journey towards 
profitability.
With a combined installation count 
exceeding 1 million EV chargers world-
wide, the union of Wallbox and ABL 
stands as a testament to their collective 
impact on the global electric vehicle 
charging landscape. ABL's pioneering 
status in EV charging solutions within 
Germany, the continent's largest EV 
market boasting over two million electric 
vehicles, further solidifies the synergy 
between the two entities.
This transaction represents a metic -
ulously crafted strategy by Wallbox, 
designed to yield immediate value for 
customers, partners, and shareholders 
alike. Foremost, it propels Wallbox's 
commercial agenda forward by enrich-
ing its product and certification arsenal, 
notably aligning with the stringent 
German EV charging calibration law 
(Eichrecht). Leveraging ABL's estab -
lished relationships, sterling reputation, 
and workforce, Wallbox now delivers an 
all-encompassing suite of residential, 
commercial, and public charging solu -
tions within the market.
As Wallbox harnesses ABL's proven 
technology and highly efficient work -
force, the outlook for sustained growth 
and innovation appears exceedingly 
promising.
Supply Chain
The ABL team is glad to have 
found a strong partner in Wallbox 
who shares our vision of an 
emissions-free world,” stated 
Ferdinand Schlutius, Co-CEO of 
ABL, “T ogether, we will proceed 
with our planned strategic steps 
and successfully launch our 
next generation EV charger, 
the eM4 and our new Schuko 
program in the market. With 
ABL and Wallbox's EV solutions 
complementing each other 
perfectly, we will hold a unique 
position in the market to meet the 
needs of all our customers.
Building Impact
Transparency in the Supply Chain
Wallbox puts transparency at the 
forefront and across its value chain 
demonstrating commitment to ethical 
business practices and sustainability, 
aligning with modern consumer expec-
tations and regulatory standards. By 
prioritizing transparency, Wallbox not 
only fosters trust and accountability but 
also ensures the integrity and resilience 
of its supply chain.
During 2023 the company is in the early 
stage of developing its inhouse software 
to evaluate suppliers’ ESG effects and 
opportunities in the following areas:
• Sustainable resources management
• Waste reduction
• Responsible chemicals and hazard-
ous materials management
• ESG impact assessments procedures
• GHG emissions, energy efficiency 
and renewables
• Air quality Control
• Water quality control
• Control of no child labor and under-
age workers
• Freedom of association
• Avolition of modern slavery
• Avolition of harassment and 
non-discrimination
• Fair wages and benefits
• Fair working hours
• Health and safety controls
• Anti-corruption and anti-bribery 
practices
• Fair competition and antitrust
• Privacy and data protection
• Protection against retaliation
The Supplier’s impact assessment tool 
is under development and starting its 
prototype phase. It will enable Wallbox 
to assess various factors that could 
impact the performance, reliability, and 
reputation of the suppliers, thereby 
helping the company to make informed 
decisions about supplier selection, 
monitoring, and management. The key 
features found in the in-house tool are 
the following:
• Impact identification
• Impact collection
• Scoring and prioritization
• Assessment criteria
• Continuous improvement
• Alerts and notifications
• Decision support
In addition, 70% of the company’s manu-
facturing suppliers are local suppliers 
which not only lessens the transportation 
cost of materials, but also contributes to: 
• Reduction of the environmental impact 
of transport emissions
• Lessen human rights impacts
• Higher levels of transparency
• More control over the supply chain
• Higher demand-response time
Wallbox efforts to fostering local part -
nerships is evident, with over 70% of 
its manufacturing suppliers being local 
entities. This deliberate choice not only 
optimizes material transportation costs but 
also contributes significantly to reducing 
environmental emissions, mitigating 
human rights impacts, enhancing transpar-
ency, bolstering supply chain control, and 
ensuring swift responsiveness to demand 
fluctuations. Through these concerted 
efforts, Wallbox aims to fortify the resilience 
and sustainability of its supply chain while 
upholding core values of integrity, account-
ability, and innovation.

Screening Assessment:
SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTION CRITERIA - CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION WBX ASSESSMENT FOR ALIGNMENT
The economic activity manufactures technologies that are aimed at and demonstrate substantial life-cycle GHG emission savings compared to the best performing 
lternative technology/product/solution available on the market.Life-cycle GHG emission savings are calculated using Commission Recommendation 2013/179/EU(96)
or, alternatively, ISO 14067:2018(97) or ISO 14064-1:2018(98).Quantified life-cycle GHG emission savings are verified by an independent third party.
Wallbox performed a life cycle assessment of the Pulsar Plus which is about 80% of our total sales and another 3 Life Cycle Assessments for its main products Supernova, 
Hypernova and Quasar. Moreover, there is no direct alternative technology considered for charging EV unless the comparison is made with gasoline cars. In this regard, we 
have assessed the total GHG footprint of Wallbox Pulsar Plus with an EV and a unit of gasoline with a fuel powered car and there is significant difference, being the Pulsar 
Plus the best perfrming alternative. The LCAs for the Supernova and Quasar electric vehicle chargers utilized internationally recognized methodologies, including ISO 14040:
2006, ISO 14044:2006, and ISO 14067:2018. Additionally, Wallbox adhered to the guidelines provided by the Product Environmental Profile (PEP) eco passport PROGRAM, 
specifically the Product Category Rules (PCRs) for Electrical, Electronic, and HVAC-R Products, as well as the Specific Rules for Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructures. 
These LCAs comprehensively analyzed all life cycle stages of the products, ensuring a holistic understanding of their environmental footprint.
DNSH CONTRIBUTION
DNSH on Climate adaptation: The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix A to this Annex.
Wallbox is currently carrying out an ESG risks analysis at a corporate level which includes an assessment of the climate transition and physical risks. All physical risks  
included in the Table I of the Appendix B have been considered in the mentioned  analysis. Moreover, an extensive climate risk assessment for the factory of Arlington has 
been performed, guided by industry-leading frameworks such as the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC) reports, scientific peer reviews, and the EU Taxonomy, the company embarked on a meticulous evaluation process. 
DNSH on Water: The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix B to this Annex.
While the company considers water a critical resource, it is not a material factor in its operations; Wallbox's production process does not require significant water 
consumption, and its usage is primarily limited to hygienic purposes for employees and in the company's cantins. Wallbox conducts a thorough analyses not only of its water 
consumption but also to understand the adverse effects arising from natural disasters. According to data provided by the Institute of Economics and Peace There has been a 
notable global escalation in natural disaster occurrences, with incidents rising from 39 in 1960 to 396 in 2019; notably, flooding emerges as the predominant natural hazard. 
During 2023, a climate risk assessment and adaptation plan was performed.
DNSH on Circular economy: The activity assesses the availability of and, where feasible, adopts techniques that support:reuse and use of secondary raw materials
and reused components in products manufactured; design for high durability, recyclability, easy disassembly and adaptability of products manufactured; waste
management that prioritises recycling over disposal, in the manufacturing process;information on and traceability of substances of concern throughout the life cycle
of the manufactured products.
Wallbox and Ares Electronics recycle and treat its waste both in the factories as well as the offices and complies with WEEE regulation. Moreover, for warranty claimed 
products, when possible, the company uses reused/refurbished components.
DNSH on Pollution prevention: The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix C to this Annex. According to the information provided, Wallbox does not use any substance with hazardous characteristics (listed in Table III of the Appendix B) and the products placed in 
market do not contain any of these substances. Moreover, Wallbox complies with REACH regulation.
DNSH on Biodiversity: The activity complies with the criteria set out in Appendix D to this Annex.
Given that the majority of Wallbox chargers are sold and installed for developed private parkings, a significant impact on biodiversity and ecosystems is not expected. 
However, the company analyzed and developed an environmental impact assessment for the construction of the new plant in Arlington, Texas, concluding that he 
environmental impact of the activity is low. Also, Wallbox analyzes the impact of biodiversity for each country where it has commercial activities.
MINIMUM SAFEGUARDS
