About 
this Report
With our Sustainability Report, we aim to give our stakeholders a comprehensive overview of 
Iveco Group’s operations, integrating our financial results and economic commitments with our 
environmental and social ones. 
This Report was prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards and includes correspondence 
tables for the main international standards, i.e., those of the Sustainability Accounting Standards 
Board (SASB), World Economic Forum (WEF), and Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD). 
Approximately 200 key performance indicators (KPIs) are reported in this document along with the 
Sustainability Plan, which sets out our sustainability priorities, the targets we have set ourselves, 
and the results achieved over the year in our efforts to reach them. 
The Report has 3 sections – the Governance and Economic Dimension, Environmental Dimension, 
and Social Dimension – followed by the Appendix with details on all KPIs.

WE DARE TO CARE.  
Dear Stakeholders,
We are pleased to present our second Sustainability Report summarising the 
milestones and progress we have made in 2023, a truly transformational year 
for Iveco Group. This edition was structured around five pairs of key words that reflect our people’s 
dedication to their work and capture the sentiment behind all of our actions, even the smallest, to 
ignite meaningful change. 
During the year, we were proud to be accepted as a participant of the UN Global Compact, the 
world’s largest corporate sustainability initiative, alongside other companies worldwide that are 
committed to taking responsible business action to create a sustainable future. The initiative calls 
on companies to align their operations and strategies with universally accepted principles regarding 
human and labour rights, environmental protection, and anti-corruption practices. This membership 
reaffirms our commitment to prioritising care and ethical conduct in everything we do.
TURNING OUR PASSION INTO PURPOSE.
We are a home of unique people and strive to make everyone feel 
welcomed, accepted, and able to express themselves to their fullest. 
As part of our efforts to foster a culture of inclusion, we announced 
our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Manifesto, published our new DEI Playbook, and launched 
multiple initiatives that celebrate diversity and raise awareness of disabilities.
We held our first-ever Sustainability and DEI Week  and hosted our first global Volunteering 
Day in support of our communities, investing €3.72 million in local initiatives and subsequently 
measuring their impact. We also continued our Red Bench initiative to highlight the importance of 
combatting gender-based violence, and to date we have installed 28 benches at our sites, all painted 
in symbolic red, and organised as many awareness seminars.

MAKING BETTER CHOICES FOR A HEALTHIER PLANET 
AND A THRIVING SOCIETY .
Mindful of the threat that climate change poses at global level, we 
undertook a thorough assessment of our direct operations, supply 
chain, and products to identify our climate-related risks and opportunities (over the short, medium, 
and long term) and to gauge our Company’s level of climate resilience and adaptability. We expanded 
our life cycle approach to develop new solutions for end-of-life products, particularly focusing on 
spare parts and batteries. We continued to make progress towards our net-zero pledge, cutting 
our CO2 emissions from manufacturing processes by 19.9% and our energy consumption by 16% 
compared to 2019. Meanwhile, we continued to put great effort into pursuing our other challenging 
targets, such as to recycle 75% of the industrial water used at our plants by 2026, and to achieve a 
38% reduction in our Scope 3 CO2 emissions from the use of sold products per vehicle/km by 2030. 
We were encouraged to see our efforts to safeguard the health of the planet recognised by the CDP . 
Taking part for the first time as an independent company, Iveco Group achieved the outstanding 
results of A- in the CDP Climate Change programme and B in the CDP Water Security programme, 
both higher than the regional and industry average. This is a great start for us, but it’s also just the 
beginning because we have no intention of stopping there.
WE CAN’T DO IT ALONE: TO EVOLVE, WE MUST ENGAGE.
2023 marked the second phase of our Voice journey, the primary 
focus of which was on our people’s growth and development and 
on tailoring clear pathways for their future at Iveco Group. We also 
intensified our efforts to foster a work environment where everyone feels heard, valued, properly 
challenged, and professionally supported; and where they are empowered to reach their potential 
and take ownership of their achievements.
But our work does not end with our people: our goal is to be more inclusive with all our stakeholders. 
With partnerships being one of our strategic pillars, our collaborations with companies such as Hyundai 
Motor Company and Amazon Web Services continued to flourish, while new partners joined us. 
We signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Shell to develop low-carbon solutions, and with 
AirLiquide we inaugurated in France the first high-pressure hydrogen station for long-haul trips in 
Europe. Our valued supplier partners were engaged in sustainability matters thanks to the Open-es 
platform, and participated in several targeted collaboration projects to increase the sustainability 
performance of our processes and products. 
We also joined the Responsible Trucking project, a collaborative platform launched by CSR Europe 
(the European Business Network for Corporate Sustainability and Responsibility) that enables 
companies to work together on evaluating the impact of their operations on logistics and to seek 
ideas for improving drivers’ working conditions.  
OUR PACT WITH YOU: TO DELIVER RESULTS.
Since publishing our first Sustainability Report in 2022, we have opened up 
our approach and results to external scrutiny, with very positive results. We 
were included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) World and Europe, and in the S&P Global 
Sustainability Yearbook 2024 in the Top 5% S&P Global CSA Score category.
Such recognition is testament to the passion and caring that everyone at Iveco Group pours into their 
work each day. For us, the key words are consistency and robustness. This applies to our processes, 
the data we report on, and our targets. It means using such tools with scientific rigour to measure 
our progress and substantiate our results on our journey towards continuous improvement. For 
example, because of this mindset, we have already reached one of our strategic targets during the 
year (originally set for 2026): to ensure that 23% of management positions are held by women. As a 
result, we decided to set ourselves an even more challenging target – to maintain gender pay equity 
across the Company and have it certified by the same deadline as the original target.
The contents of our 2023 Sustainability Report are designed to give you a glimpse into our 
unwavering dedication to sustainability and innovation. Ours is a journey in constant evolution, and 
we will stay the course to go beyond conventional thinking. As we share with you the milestones we 
have achieved thus far, we are reminded of the endless possibilities that lie ahead. So please join us. 
Together, we can shape a better and brighter tomorrow for generations to come.
Best regards,

1.2.1 Our Business Model
Iveco Group is a global automotive leader active in the Commercial and Specialty Vehicles, 
Powertrain, and related Financial Services arenas – with a strategy based on the three pillars 
of innovation, sustainability, and partnerships. Each of Iveco Group’s 8 brands is a major 
force in its own specific line of business: IVECO, a pioneering commercial vehicles brand that 
designs, manufactures, and markets heavy, medium, and light-duty trucks; FPT Industrial, a 
global leader in advanced powertrain technologies offering a vast array of solutions in the 
agriculture, construction, marine, power generation, and commercial vehicles sectors; IVECO 
BUS and HEULIEZ, both premium mass-transit bus and coach brands; IDV , for highly-specialised 
defence and civil protection equipment; ASTRA, a leader in large-scale heavy-duty quarry 
and construction vehicles; MAGIRUS, industry-renowned firefighting vehicle and equipment 
manufacturer; and IVECO CAPITAL, the finance arm supporting them all.
When we launched our Voice engagement campaign and related survey in 2022, we involved 
every employee in defining our Company’s purpose and 5 corporate Values that truly reflect 
the way Iveco Group wants to do business.
We apply our purpose and Values every day and in everything we do, supported by:
 • a system of principles, rules, and procedures in which roles and responsibilities are clearly 
defined 
 • a process that anticipates and manages current and future economic, environmental, and 
social risks and opportunities
 • a set of strategic business and sustainability priorities that help steer everyone’s efforts.
At Iveco Group, we believe that innovation and the design of products and services tailored to 
our customers’ needs are fundamental aspects of our competitive advantage, integral to all our 
activities and processes in the creation of value. It is what enables us to compete with other 
market players and to be seen by our customers as a true partner.
The main objective of Iveco Group’s business is to create value for stakeholders, which are 
classified based on the pillars identified by the World Economic Forum (WEF):
 • Planet: representing the commitment to not underestimate the threats the planet is facing. 
Building a safer and more sustainable world requires the right balance between humanity 
and nature, and pursuing the necessary targets can no longer be postponed
 • People: representing the commitment to consider the different perspectives of those who 
are impacted by our business, while actively encouraging them to join us on our path 
towards positive change
 • Prosperity: representing the commitment to ensure more prosperity for all, through the 
adoption of new technologies and the transition towards a more inclusive and digital 
society.
The key points of Iveco Group’s value chain can be summarised as follows:
 • Our People & Operations : representing the people who apply their skills to develop 
products and services with the utmost dedication in all Company areas, supported by 
production processes that are efficient, technologically innovative, and environmentally 
friendly
 • Our Products & Services : representing the Company’s product offering designed to 
ensure customers enjoy lower operating and maintenance costs, superior performance, 
maximum profitability, lower total cost of ownership (TCO), and technological innovation 
 • Our Valued Partners : representing those who make up Iveco Group’s ecosystem 
(mainly the dealerships, service network, and suppliers), with whom the Company 
shares a common understanding and collaborates to map out a path through the current 
challenging transition; they make Iveco Group an efficient Company able to give its utmost 
to customers, our ultimate and most valued partners.
We believe that long-term success is achieved by pairing innovation with resource efficiency, 
and financial prosperity with ESG performance. For this reason, the organisational model 
implemented at Iveco Group was designed to strengthen:
 • the entrepreneurial agility of business units
 • the focus on new technologies and digital solutions
 • customer centricity
 • clear accountability
 • synergies between business units to achieve global consistency
 • the Company’s efficiency and effectiveness
 • Corporate Governance.

1.2.2 Our Stakeholders
Stakeholders2 present a wide range of differing interests, so establishing and maintaining 
stable and lasting relationships with them is crucial for creating shared value over the long 
term. At Iveco Group, we promote ongoing communication and active engagement with our 
stakeholders worldwide, interacting with them continually and proactively throughout the year 
via our dedicated functions. To this end, in 2023, our Board of Directors adopted the Stakeholder 
Dialogue Policy on Sustainable Strategy to govern the dialogue with our relevant stakeholders 
on the sustainability aspects of our strategy. We consider these exchanges as opportunities for 
mutual growth and improvement, which is why we work hard to build cooperation and trust 
with receptiveness and engagement. 
Through an internal assessment performed by the corporate functions that manage our 
stakeholder relations on a daily basis, we have identified and selected several key stakeholders 
to better understand their specific requirements and priorities; this enables us to deal with 
issues before they become critical, and to fine-tune our responses according to their interests.
(2) As per the ISO 26000 international standard providing guidance on social responsibility, a stakeholder is defined as an individual or 
group that has an interest that is affected or could be affected by the decisions or activities of an organisation. 
SUSTAINABILITY CAMPAIGN
After the publication of our first Iveco Group Sustainability Report in 
April 2023, we launched a dedicated campaign to increase awareness 
of our sustainability priorities and disseminate our key accomplishments of 2022, our first 
year as an independent Company. The campaign spanned 4 months, with each month 
focusing on one of the Company’s sustainability priorities: carbon footprint, workplace 
and product safety , life cycle thinking , and inclusion and engagement . The campaign 
included weekly posts on our social media channels and reached employees via emails, 
Intranet posts, bulletins, and digital posters. It provided valuable insights through 
engaging videos and graphics showcasing the Company's daily efforts to advance a more 
sustainable society.
Broadly speaking, Iveco Group interacts with and has a responsibility towards many different stakeholder categories.
These are: the Employees and their Families; Other Workers, Trade Unions and Employee Representatives; Customers; the Dealer and Service Network; the 
Suppliers and Business Partners; the Financial Community, which includes Shareholders and Traditional and ESG Investors; Public Institutions; Scientific 
and Technological Research Centres and Universities; Local Communities; the Environment; and the Next generations.
The corporate functions that manage our relations with each of these stakeholders include: Human Resources; Communications; the Business Units; Man -
ufacturing; Financial Services; Technology & Digital; Finance; Public Affairs & Sustainability; Legal, Compliance & Corporate Governance; and our Supply 
Chain – each according to their respective spheres of competence.

about the UN Global Compact
In addition to the specific engagement process conducted during the materiality analysis, 
we regularly promote ongoing communication with our stakeholders worldwide through the 
following 4 levels of engagement.
We Inform them, which entails one-way communication from Iveco Group to Stakeholders through publications and reports, our corporate website, the press, social and digital 
media, official public events, and advocacy.
We Listen to them, which entails one-way communication from Stakeholders to Iveco Group through interviews and meetings, the media, investor relationships, special events, 
surveys, and feedback via other means.
We Involve them, for example, through the materiality analysis, dedicated web portals, shared projects and workshops, forums, collective bargaining, and the Compliance 
Helpline.
Lastly, we Collaborate with them, through partnerships, joint projects, and shared decision-making processes.
1.2.3 Our Sustainability
It is our mission to put sustainability at the heart of our strategy, making it an integral part 
of our day-to-day activities to ensure business is conducted in an economically sound, 
environmentally friendly, and socially beneficial way. By fully integrating environmental and 
social considerations with economic objectives, we are able to identify potential risks and 
seize additional development opportunities, creating a process of continuous – and above all 
sustainable – improvement that creates value over the long term. 
In 2023, we became a  participant of the UN Global Compact, the world’s largest corporate 
sustainability initiative with more than 18,000 companies and 3,800 non-business signatories in 
over 160 countries. We thus joined thousands of other companies worldwide that are committed 
to taking responsible business action to create a sustainable future. The initiative calls on 
companies to align their operations and strategies with universally accepted principles in the 
areas of human rights, labour, the environment, and anti-corruption. It also encourages action in 
support of the goals and issues addressed in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals3 (SDGs). 
We have established a robust organisational structure to optimise the management of 
sustainability aspects within the Company. The highest responsibility for sustainability matters at 
Iveco Group lies with the Board of Directors’ ESG Committee. From an executive point of view, 
this responsibility falls under the Senior Leadership Team (SLT) Sustainability Committee; 
from an operational one, under the Sustainability Department within the Sustainability Team.
The Sustainability Team is a network of experts responsible for incorporating sustainability 
criteria more effectively into Company strategy and for ensuring the necessary support for 
sustainability activities.
The Team comprises the following:
 • the Head of the Public Affairs & Sustainability function (PA&S)
 • the Sustainability Department
 • Sustainability Representatives.
The Chief Sustainability Officer, a member of the Senior Leadership Team (SLT) and chair  
of the SLT Sustainability Committee, oversees our sustainability activities, provides visionary 
leadership, and coordinates with our management, shareholders, and employees to promote 
the continuous improvement of an effective corporate sustainability approach. 
(3) Sustainable Development Goals are set out in resolution A/RES/70/1, Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 25 September 2015.

about the SDGs
The Sustainability Department oversees two main areas: our sustainability strategy and 
our sustainability initiatives. Among other things, it monitors external trends and incorporates 
them into our activities in line with stakeholder requirements, it proposes projects involving the 
Company and/or the community, and promotes the adoption of good practices to encourage 
their integration into Company processes. From an operational perspective, it is tasked with: 
conducting the materiality analysis and stakeholder engagement processes; managing all 
sustainability planning and reporting aspects; completing questionnaires required by sustainability 
rating agencies; and managing initiatives that support the development of local communities. The 
Sustainability Department manager also acts as secretary to the SLT Sustainability Committee. 
Additionally, the Sustainability Department is responsible for: 
 • promoting a culture of sustainability throughout the Company, engaging all levels of the 
organisation
 • promoting the integration of sustainability into day-to-day activities, implementing the 
strategies defined by the sustainability committees
 • facilitating continuous improvement by supporting and motivating our corporate functions
 • strengthening relationships with stakeholders while enhancing their perceptions
 • interacting regularly with our executive teams and Board of Directors and providing 
updates on our sustainability performance.
Sustainability Representatives  are appointed to represent our operating areas. They are 
responsible for:
 • ensuring the support and alignment required across the Company
 • bringing expertise to specific issues relating to the Company’s reporting process
 • formulating proposals for continuous improvement.
They provide a direct link between our Sustainability Department and our various operating 
areas, ensuring both technical and organisational support.
1.2.3.1 STRATEGIC SUSTAINABILITY PRIORITIES AND TARGETS
We have defined and fine-tuned our sustainability priorities so as to ensure better alignment with 
our core business. The 4 strategic sustainability priorities that underpin our sustainability strategy are:
 • carbon footprint: to reduce CO2 emissions from our manufacturing processes, from our 
product range, and along our entire value chain (supply and logistics), aiming for net zero 
carbon emissions by 2040
 • workplace and product safety : to minimise the risk of workplace injuries through 
effective preventive and protective measures, and to ensure Company products have the 
highest safety standards
 • life cycle thinking : to implement solutions that efficiently minimise the impact of our 
products and processes through a circular product life cycle approach
 • inclusion and engagement: to build ever-stronger relationships with our stakeholders, 
continuing to work proactively and effectively to create an inclusive work environment.
To strengthen our efforts on our journey towards a sustainable future, we have mapped out the 
path to achieving these 4 strategic priorities by setting clear objectives, with specific reference 
to our people, direct operations, products and services, and valued partners. 
These targets are a part of our Strategic Business Plan, and progress is regularly reported to 
both the ESG Committee and to the SLT Sustainability Committee. They are also incorporated 
into the Sustainability Plan, which includes both long and short-term targets and reflects our 
commitment to contributing to development, in harmony with people and the environment. Clear 
responsibilities are defined for each target to ensure they are consistently monitored and achieved. 
It should be noted that, in keeping with the previous year, 2023’s executive compensation 
was linked, among other things, to the achievement of 2 of our strategic sustainability targets: 
specifically, the long-term incentive plan was linked to the reduction in CO2 emissions (Scope 
1 and 2) compared to 2019, while the short-term incentives were linked to the increase in 
management positions held by women.
Mindful that our strategic sustainability targets can contribute to the achievement of the UN’s 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we developed a process to identify the SDGs most 
relevant to our business and that we are best equipped to support.
This process consisted of 3 phases:
 • all 17 SDGs, and their respective targets and indicators, were compared with our strategic 
targets to identify possible links
 • associated risks and actual or potential impacts were identified for each SDG and strategic 
target in relation to our processes, products, and services
 • the results were analysed, confirming 10 SDGs as most relevant to the Company.
These are: 
SDG 3 Good Health and Wellbeing; SDG 4 Quality Education; SDG 5 Gender 
Equality; SDG 6 Clean Water and Sanitation; SDG 7 Affordable and Clean 
Energy; SDG 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth; SDG 9 Industry, Innova -
tion, and Infrastructure; SDG 10 Reduced Inequalities; SDG 12 Responsible 
Consumption and Production; and SDG 13 Climate Action.

1.2.3.2 MATERIALITY ANALYSIS
We carried out our materiality analysis applying the revised approach to materiality introduced 
by the GRI Universal Standards 4 published in 2021. This new approach focuses on the 
identification of topics that are likely to be material for an organisation based on the latter’s 
most significant impacts (whether positive or negative, actual or potential) on the economy, 
the environment, and people (including on human rights). This inside-out perspective, which 
considers the impacts that are or could be generated by a company, was adopted when 
performing Iveco Group’s impact materiality analysis, as per the GRI requirements.
Acting proactively and anticipating the requirements of the EU’s Corporate Sustainability 
Reporting Directive (CSRD), we also performed a second materiality analysis, implementing, 
for the first time, a double-materiality approach, which integrates a financial materiality 
perspective with the impact materiality perspective. The financial materiality analysis entails 
an outside-in approach, identifying topics that are likely to be material for an organisation due 
to their respective sustainability risks and opportunities that have or could have a significant 
impact on future cash flows, with potential financial repercussions for company development, 
performance, and positioning in the short, medium, and long term. 
When assessing risks and opportunities from a financial perspective, we also considered our 
dependencies on the availability of natural, human, and social resources. Such dependencies can 
themselves pose financial risks and opportunities, potentially affecting our ability to continue 
to use or obtain the resources needed in our business processes (including in terms of quality 
and pricing) and to rely on relationships needed to conduct our business on acceptable terms.
(4) The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is a multi-stakeholder association for the development and disclosure of standards for reporting 
on an organisation’s economic, environmental, and/or social impacts.
The following are the main steps involved in identifying Iveco Group’s material topics.
Step 1: Analysis and understanding of the organisational and business context.  
Understanding Iveco Group’s activities, business relationships, and stakeholders, as well as the 
sustainability context in which it operates, was the first step towards identifying the Company’s 
impacts, risks, and opportunities. To this end, a benchmark analysis was performed against 
comparable industry enterprises and according to the requirements of the main international 
sustainability standards. An analysis of the external context was performed as well, to identify 
the main sustainability-related trends and aspects of the industry in which we operate.
Step 2: Identification of impacts, risks, and opportunities. To obtain an exhaustive list of 
Iveco Group’s main impacts, risks, and opportunities according to both impact materiality and 
financial materiality perspectives, the analysis performed in Step 1 also took into consideration 
the risks identified through the Company’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) risk assessment 
process, which is conducted on a regular basis.

Step 3 : Assessment of the significance of impacts, risks, and opportunities. The 
significance of the identified impacts was assessed based on their severity, extent, irreparable 
nature (only for negative impacts), and probability. The significance of the identified risks 
and opportunities, on the other hand, was assessed based on the severity and probability 
parameters employed by the ERM system, and on their extent in terms of potential to create or 
diminish corporate value – and therefore to impact the Company’s development, performance, 
and positioning in the short, medium, and long term. The above impacts, risks, and opportunities 
were duly assessed (on a scale of 1-4) by the members of our Sustainability Leadership Team 
during a day-long workshop, after in-depth discussions on emerging ESG trends led by external 
experts attending the event. The assessment process also involved online interviews with 
sustainability experts and some of the Company’s main stakeholders.
Step 4: Definition and prioritisation of the material topics based on the significance 
of impacts, risks, and opportunities. As per the requirements of the 2021 GRI Universal 
Standards, we used the outcomes of Iveco Group’s impacts assessment to create a priority 
list of material topics (14 in total), classified according to the 4 priorities5 of our sustainability 
strategy. This list was submitted to and approved by the ESG Committee of Iveco Group’s Board 
of Directors.
(5) Iveco Group’s 4 strategic sustainability priorities are: carbon footprint, workplace and product safety, life cycle thinking, and inclusion 
and engagement. 
The 14 material topics identified through the materiality analysis are: Product quality and safety; CO 2 emissions from vehicles; Human rights; Occupational health and safety; Diversity, equity, and inclusion; Sustainable supply chain; 
Dealer and customer management; Circular product life cycle; CO 2 emissions from logistics; Employee development and training; CO 2 emissions from operations; the Responsible management of natural resources; Digitalisation 
and connectivity; and Local communities.

It should be noted that, within the scope of the analysis, aspects related to Corporate 
Governance, business ethics, and regulatory compliance were considered prerequisites, and 
therefore were not examined individually. Furthermore, the concept of innovation is integral to 
all material topics, particularly those related to products and to production processes.
All topics submitted for assessment within the impact materiality analysis were found to be 
material to Iveco Group.
The two most material topics, product quality and safety and CO 2 emissions from vehicles, 
reflect the importance to Iveco Group’s brands of offering customers products that have 
low environmental impact, are safe and reliable, and comply with high quality standards. 
The material topics human rights, occupational health and safety, and diversity, equity, and 
inclusion reflect the Company’s commitment to ensure a safe and inclusive work environment, 
where all diversity is valued and human rights are protected – not only within the organisation 
but also across the entire value chain. The presence of sustainable supply chain and dealer 
and customer management on the list reflects the Company’s continuous effort towards the 
increasingly efficient and responsible management of its activities and entire value chain.
By integrating the outcomes of the two assessments (risks and opportunities with impacts), 
we were able to define Iveco Group’s material topics and position them within a Materiality 
Matrix, a visual representation of both impact materiality and financial materiality perspectives.
In 2023, we took an additional step in our materiality analysis by evaluating the relevance of 
our current material topics (and their associated impacts, risks, and opportunities) in South 
America, taking into account the local context and specific needs. The analysis was performed 
on site, directly involving the local management team in a dedicated workshop. It confirmed 
the same positioning on the Materiality Matrix of our top 3 material topics (product quality 
and safety, CO 2 emissions from vehicles, and human rights). It also showed the greater 
significance at local level of 3 material topics concerning financial materiality (CO 2 emissions 
from logistics, CO2 emissions from operations, and sustainable supply chain) and of 1 material 
topic concerning impact materiality (local communities).

With the addition of financial materiality to the matrix, product quality and safety and CO2 
emissions from vehicles emerged as priorities on which Iveco Group believes it should focus its 
efforts, reflecting the importance of offering ever safer, low-emission products to consolidate 
its market position.
From an outside-in perspective, CO2 emissions from vehicles is the topic with the most material 
financial impact, given the investment needed to reduce the environmental impact of vehicles, 
as well as the potential economic incentives and/or market opportunities relevant to the 
decarbonisation strategy that Iveco Group is pursuing. This topic is also significant from an 
inside-out perspective, as reflected by its high impact materiality.
Product quality and safety is a priority from both a financial materiality and impact materiality 
perspective, reflecting how the focus on high-quality, reliable products is indispensable for 
generating value and increasing market share. Dealer and customer management is especially 
important in financial materiality terms, demonstrating how the customer relationship is 
vital in creating new business opportunities. Human rights emerged as material from both 
perspectives, highlighting an increase in awareness of this topic and of the needs of minority 
groups. This increased awareness can help enhance our Company’s reputation. Furthermore, 
when combined with continuous monitoring, it can also help minimise the risk of human rights 
violations.

1.2.3.2.1 Focus on Iveco Group’s Two Main Material Topics
MATERIAL ISSUE FOR COMPANY VALUE CREATION
WHY IT IS MATERIAL TO OUR BUSINESS PRIMARY BUSINESS STRATEGY TO ADDRESS THE TOPIC LONG-TERM METRIC/TARGET TO MEASURE PROGRESS
This topic is related to the delivery of safe, high-quality vehicles to 
customers by adopting the highest standards to maximise road user safety. 
It is material to Company value creation because of the following 
considerations:
• the risk associated with this topic refers to changes in technical and/
or product safety regulations, which may entail greater costs to achieve 
compliance
• a rise in customer demand for high quality vehicles may lead to new 
business opportunities  and to an increase in market share.
Designing products according to high safety standards to protect drivers, 
passengers, and all other road users presents a daily challenge for  
Iveco Group, and is a part of our responsibility towards the community.
Accordingly, our research and development into safety systems focuses on 
3 key areas:
• active safety: collision avoidance and driving assistance, with a focus on 
devices that support the driver in both normal and emergency situations 
(when warning alerts are triggered)
• passive safety: damage mitigation
• tertiary safety: post-crash safety management. 
2026 Target:
100% of new vehicles in Europe equipped with advanced driver assistance 
systems (ADAS) and additional advanced functions, such as adaptive cruise 
control (ACC), ACC Stop & Go, corrective steering function (CSF), and lane 
centring (LC).
2023 Progress : 
Ongoing development of Level 2 ADAS for new vehicle models.
MATERIAL ISSUE FOR EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS
TOPIC RELEVANCE TO EXTERNAL
STAKEHOLDERS IMPACT VALUATION OUTPUT METRIC AND IMPACT METRIC 
The topic is related to the impact that our products and services may have 
on stakeholders. Our impact assessment covered more than 50% of the 
Company’s business activities. This topic is material to external stakeholders 
because of the following considerations:
• a decline in product quality due to complex design or production 
processes can have a negative impact  on customer safety and/or 
satisfaction
• enhanced vehicle quality and safety resulting from new technologies 
can have a positive impact  on customer satisfaction and on reducing 
potential vehicle damage.
The decision to launch a recall campaign takes into consideration both 
technical factors and the impact on customers. Product safety aspects 
are evaluated using state-of-the-art tools and methodologies, such as 
safety risk assessments, and the Company determines whether to launch a 
particular safety recall campaign based on the index obtained. The impact 
on customers is measured as their lost revenue due to the given recall 
campaign.
Output Metric:
Number of recall campaigns.
2023 Impact Metric: €2.4 million
(Quantified based on the number of vehicles affected in recall campaigns, 
the average days of downtime, and the average daily income of customers, 
divided by the number of recall campaigns).

Governance Bodies Ethical Behaviour Risk and Opportunities Creating Prosperity
Material topic: CO2 emissions from vehicles
MATERIAL ISSUE FOR COMPANY VALUE CREATION
WHY IT IS MATERIAL TO OUR BUSINESS PRIMARY BUSINESS STRATEGY TO ADDRESS THE TOPIC LONG-TERM METRIC/TARGET TO MEASURE PROGRESS
This topic is related to the development of innovative solutions to reduce the 
carbon footprint of vehicles. It is material to Company value creation because 
of the following considerations: 
• an increase in demand for low carbon vehicles comes with the risk of 
requiring significant investments, which could impact Iveco Group’s 
financials
• greater demand for low carbon vehicles may lead to new business 
opportunities  and to an increase in market share.
The diversified offering of Iveco Group’s brands plays a pivotal role in our 
decarbonisation strategy, requiring the multi-energy approach that we have 
been pursuing for many years now, and that currently comprises propulsions 
ranging from traditional technologies to natural gas (NG), biofuels, electric 
mobility, and hydrogen.
2030 Target:
-38% vs 2022 in Scope 3 CO2 emissions from the use of sold products per 
vehicle/km. 
2023 Progress:
-6.1% vs 2022 in Scope 3 CO2 emissions from the use of sold products per 
vehicle/km.
MATERIAL ISSUE FOR EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS
TOPIC RELEVANCE TO EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS IMPACT VALUATIO N OUTPUT METRIC AND IMPACT METRIC
The topic is related to the impact that our products and services may have 
on stakeholders. Our impact assessment covered more than 50% of the 
Company’s business activities. This topic is material to external stakeholders 
because of the following considerations:
• failure to develop products with low carbon emissions has a negative 
impact  on the environment
• the introduction of innovative solutions that enhance vehicle efficiency 
during use has a positive impact  on climate change mitigation.
Reducing GHG emissions from Iveco Group’s products can contribute 
to improving air quality and to mitigating the impact of climate change 
on the environment. To measure this impact, we use the social cost of 
carbon, which is an estimate (in US dollars) of the economic damages that 
would result from emitting one additional ton of carbon dioxide into the 
atmosphere. According to the latest update of the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA), the social cost of carbon dioxide in 2023 was estimated at 
$204, an increase compared to the previous estimate due to more stringent 
climate provisions and regulations, which will increase costs for consumers.
Output Metric:
CO2 emissions from the use of sold products per vehicle/km.
2023 Impact Metric: $28 million
(Calculated as the difference compared to the previous year in annual CO 2 
emissions from the use of sold products in Europe multiplied by the social 
cost of carbon).

1.2.3.3 SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Iveco Group’s sustainability management system consists of the following tools:
 • our Code of Conduct, approved by the Board of Directors, and related policies that set 
out our approach to key issues 
 • our Supplier Code of Conduct 
 • a set of Company policies to manage specific issues 
 • stakeholder engagement on material topics 
 • our materiality analysis, which defines social and environmental priorities
 • a set of approximately 200 sustainability-related key performance indicators , 
designed to provide maximum coverage of all our key environmental, social, and governance 
aspects, in line with the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards), the 
Sustainability Accounting Standards (SASB Standards), the Guidelines of the World 
Economic Forum (WEF), and the standards of the major sustainability rating agencies
 • our Sustainability Plan , which tracks the commitments undertaken and includes our 
strategic sustainability targets
 • our annual Sustainability Report , which discloses the Company’s sustainability 
performance
 • a summary in the Annual Report, supplementing the financial data as per the requirement 
of the Dutch Decree on Non-Financial Information, which incorporated Directive 2014/95/
EU into Dutch law. It also reports on our climate change mitigation actions as per both the 
framework and recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD)6 and the requirements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. The latter establishes a list of 
environmentally sustainable economic activities in support of the EU Green Deal objectives.
(6) Task force of 32 international members (including providers of capital, insurers, large non-financial companies, accounting and 
consulting firms, and credit rating agencies) established by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) in 2015 to develop recommendations 
for more efficient and effective climate-related disclosures. In 2023, the responsibility for monitoring the progress of companies’ 
climate-related disclosures was transferred from the TCFD to the IFRS Foundation (effective as of 2024), following the release of the 
new IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards. As a result, Iveco Group has already started to incorporate the contents of the IFRS S2 
Climate-related Disclosures, with full alignment expected by 2024. 
1.2.3.4 THE SUSTAINABILITY PLAN AND REPORTING PROCESS
The Sustainability Report is the means by which we present our non-financial performance to 
stakeholders. It also includes the Sustainability Plan, which states the sustainability-related  
commitments made to them by Iveco Group. The Report is prepared according to the following 
procedure.
The commitments and targets that make up the Sustainability Plan are identified and set by our 
corporate functions with the assistance of the Sustainability Department, which also ensures 
the incorporation of our stakeholders’ expectations evidenced by our materiality analysis. It is 
the responsibility of the Sustainability Department to ensure that our medium- to long-term 
targets are in line with both stakeholders’ expectations and Company strategies. The Plan is 
updated annually and reviewed mid-year.
After our Sustainability Plan and Sustainability Report have been prepared and updated by the 
Sustainability Department, the various targets and chapters are sent to the relevant individual 
owners for approval. Once this approval process is completed, the full Sustainability Report, 
including the Sustainability Plan, is:
 • submitted to SGS Nederland B.V ., an independent certification body, for auditing as per 
Sustainability Reporting Assurance (SRA) procedures and in compliance with both the GRI 
Standards and the AA1000 Accountability Principles Standard (2018). SGS is officially 
authorised to provide assurance as per the AA1000 Assurance Standard v3. The audit also 
covers the alignment of our sustainability management system with the ISO 26000:2010 
guidelines on social responsibility
 • approved by the SLT Sustainability Committee
 • approved by the Chief Executive Officer
 • reviewed by the ESG Committee
 • approved by the Board of Directors
 • discussed at Iveco Group’s Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, to provide a complete 
and up-to-date overview of our sustainability strategy to our shareholders and investors
 • published and made publicly available in the sustainability section of our website.

1.3 Governance Bodies 
1.3.1 Governance Structure
Iveco Group is a public limited liability company, incorporated and organised under the laws of 
the Netherlands and listed on the Euronext Milan, managed by the Italian Stock Exchange. As 
such, we comply with applicable Dutch law, the Italian Stock Exchange’s relevant regulations, 
and the best practice provisions7 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code (DCGC). The DCGC’s 
purpose is to facilitate a sound and transparent system of checks and balances within Dutch 
listed companies; to this end, it regulates the relationships within each board of directors and 
between boards and their respective shareholders.
Our Company’s Governance model is built on a structure and a set of rules adopted to ensure 
the ethical, transparent, and sustainable management of operations. We believe that a robust 
Governance model is crucial in managing our businesses effectively and in the long-term 
interests of all our stakeholders. Moreover, by giving due weight to sustainability issues, our 
model fosters a long-term corporate outlook and contributes to risk-adjusted returns, as it 
ensures that our performance is due to careful consideration and long-term thinking and it 
enables continuous improvement based on analysis and results achieved each year. It also 
ensures that risk management controls are in place to safeguard the value of investments. Since 
a robust system of governance is essential for all Company activities, it is a prerequisite for the 
materiality analysis.
(7) Except as discussed in the section ‘Compliance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code’ in the 2023 Annual Report.
Within the Corporate Governance section of Iveco Group’s Annual Report (available on our 
corporate website), the Board Report provides a comprehensive description of the most 
significant aspects of our Governance model, while the Remuneration Report includes a 
detailed insight into the Company’s remuneration policy and practices. The following highlights 
focus on specific aspects of interest.
Iveco Group’s Articles of Association8 envisage a one-tier Board of Directors structure where 
the executive directors are primarily responsible for all day-to-day operations, while the non-
executive directors (directly and through the Board Committees, entirely made up of non-
executive directors) have oversight of the executive directors’ policy and performance of duties 
and of the Company’s general affairs and business; the non-executive directors also render 
advice and direction to the executive directors. 
On certain key industrial matters (including sustainability), the Board is advised by the Senior 
Leadership Team (SLT), an operational decision-making body of Iveco Group responsible for 
reviewing the operating performance of our business areas and that is supervised by the non-
executive directors. The SLT, in turn, provides the non-executive directors with all the information 
they need to fulfil their responsibilities.
(8) The Articles of Association are available on the Company’s website.

1.3.2 Board of Directors
The Board of Directors9 has collective responsibility for the strategy, management, supervision, and 
continuity of the Company. Among other things, it oversees the development of Iveco Group’s mission 
and vision, as well as its culture, strategies, policies, and goals regarding economic, environmental10, 
and social topics. Both directly and through its Committees, it engages in discussions on strategic, 
industrial, and technological scenarios. It oversees the risk management process. It approves annual 
budgets and strategic plans and targets, and monitors their progress vis-à-vis actual results and 
forecasts. Lastly, it supervises major projects and transactions while continually reviewing the 
Company’s innovation priorities over time.
As per the Company’s Articles of Association, the Board consists of 3 or more directors, who are 
individually elected by the General Meeting of Shareholders on an annual basis. 
As at 31 December 2023, it was composed of 9 directors, of whom 2 (22%) were executive 
directors (one with the title of Chairperson – Suzanne Heywood – and one with the title of 
Chief Executive Officer – Gerrit Marx), and 7 (78%) non-executive directors. At the same date, 
33% of the directors identified as female and 67% identified as male, and the Board included 
representatives of 7 different nationalities; 4 Board members were in the 30-50 age group (44%), 
5 members were in the over-50 age group (56%), and no member was under 30 years of age.
(9) References to the Board of Directors are as at 31 December 2023.
(10) The environmental sphere includes climate-related and water-related issues.
As per the Dutch Corporate Governance Code (DCGC), the overall composition of the non-
executive directors is such that they can operate independently and critically with respect to one 
another, to the executive directors, and to any other particular interest involved. 
As at 31 December 2023, 4 directors (44%) met the independence criteria  set forth by 
the DCGC. Independent directors play an essential role in protecting the interests of all 
stakeholders. Their contribution is also necessary for the proper composition and functioning 
of the Board Committees, whose advisory functions include preliminary examination and 
formulation of proposals relating to areas of potential risk, such as the prevention of potential 
conflicts of interest. In 2023, Independent Director Lorenzo Simonelli was reappointed as 
Senior Non-Executive Director. According to the Company’s Articles of Association, it is the 
senior non-executive director who performs the role of chair of the Board of Directors as stated 
in law. As per the Company’s Regulations of the Board of Directors11, the senior non-executive 
director presides over meetings and is responsible for the proper functioning of the Board and 
its Committees. 
In 2023, there were 7 Board meetings and, despite the absence of a minimum attendance 
requirement, the directors’ overall attendance was 100%, as indicated in the following table.
(11) The Regulations of the Board of Directors are available on the Company’s website.

GOVERNANCE & ECONOMIC
Regarding conflicts of interest, the Regulations of the Board of Directors state that Board 
members shall not participate in discussions or decision-making with respect to a matter in 
relation to which they have a direct or indirect personal interest that is in conflict with the 
interests of the Company and/or business associated with the Company. In the event of a 
conflict of interest, Board members are required to report it immediately, so that the non-
executive directors can assess the situation and, if appropriate, exclude the conflicted director 
from the discussion and decision-making process; all conflicted transactions require the 
approval of the non-executive directors. Furthermore, in compliance with the DCGC, in our 
continuous effort to prevent conflicts of interest in general, the Board as a whole may, on 
an ad hoc basis, resolve that the perception of a conflict of interest of an individual director 
is significant enough in relation to a specific matter that it is in the best interest of a proper 
decision-making process that said individual director be excused from participation. Finally, 
as a precautionary measure and based on the information available to the Company, should 
the perception of a conflict of interest of an individual Board member be significant enough 
in relation to a specific matter, the Chairperson will exclude said director from the relevant 
information flow, pending a decision by the full Board.
We believe that an appropriate and diversified mix of skills, professional backgrounds, and 
diversity factors  are fundamental to the proper functioning of the Board as a collegial 
body – as set forth in the Regulations of the Board of Directors, in our Guidelines on Board 
composition, and in our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Policy12. It is generally recognised that a 
diverse board is more effective in performing its monitoring and advisory activities due to the  
(12) The Regulations of the Board of Directors, the Guidelines on the composition of the Board of Directors, and Iveco Group’s Diversity, 
Equity & Inclusion Policy are available on the Company’s website.
variety of professional experience, perspectives, insights, skills, and connections to the outside 
world that diversity can bring to the table. Indeed, pursuant to the DCGC’s recommendations, 
a formal statement by the Board is available on the Profile page of our corporate website 
acknowledging that the Board of Directors should be composed of individuals who bring the 
appropriate skills and experience needed for a company of Iveco Group’s size, geographic 
distribution, and business focus. To this end, when assessing candidates for appointment as 
directors, the Board also considers several diversity factors including, but not limited to, gender, 
ethnicity, education, and nationality, believing that bringing different perspectives into the 
Boardroom creates more effective discussions. Indeed, as per our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion 
Policy (adopted in October 2023) and in line with the Company’s overall aspirations and 
commitments within the framework of its strategic planning, the Board annually sets a number 
of specific targets addressing diversity. These targets concern the entire workforce as well as 
the composition of the Board itself, and are meant to guide decision making and ensure focus.
Each Board member’s main skills have been summarised in individual charts available on the 
corporate website under their respective profiles; these skills were self-assessed using a 3-level 
scale (basic, medium, or full skill)13. In light of the attributes of its individual directors, and based 
on the annual self-assessment performed under the oversight of the ESG Committee, the Board 
considers itself a diverse body, well suited to fulfilling its duties vis-à-vis the Company’s existing 
and prospective challenges, and will continue to consider enhanced diversity as a priority.

1.3.3 Senior Leadership Team 
At executive level, the Senior Leadership Team (SLT) oversees the quality and execution of our

management and external reporting.
The SLT comprises Iveco Group’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and key senior managers. It is

1.4 Ethical Behaviour 
1.4.1 Our Regulations
At Iveco Group, we strongly believe that our long-term success depends on our ability to 
do business in a manner that is socially responsible, ethical, and compliant with the laws of 
each country of operation. To this end, our actions are guided by specific policies on various 
compliance and ethics issues, such as conflicts of interest, corruption, competition, human 
rights, and health and safety. These policies are summarised in our Code of Conduct, reflecting 
among other things our commitment to adopting fair employment practices, ensuring safety 
in the workplace, supporting and fostering environmental awareness, and respecting the 
communities in which we operate, as per applicable legislation. 
The policies also reflect our commitment to creating long-term sustainable value for all our 
stakeholders, which we are firmly convinced is only attainable by ensuring full respect for fundamental 
human and labour rights. Fostering a culture of long-term value creation requires compliance with 
all applicable laws. This responsibility lies with our Board of Directors, which implements both the 
Iveco Group Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct to ensure such compliance and to 
communicate the Company’s values and expectations as clearly and explicitly as possible.
1.4.1.1 CODE OF CONDUCT AND POLICIES
Iveco Group’s Code of Conduct  is one of the pillars of our Corporate Governance system, 
which regulates decision-making processes and the approach used by Company and employees 
alike in interacting with all stakeholders. The Code of Conduct summarises the values we 
recognise, adhere to, and promote, in the belief that integrity and fairness are important drivers 
of long-term value creation and social and economic development.
The Iveco Group Code of Conduct is an integral part of our internal control systems. It applies 
to all Iveco Group directors, officers, and employees, as well as to those acting for or on behalf 
of any Iveco Group legal entities worldwide (including all joint ventures in which the Company 
holds a controlling interest). 
Among other things, the Code of Conduct addresses the ethical aspects of economic, social, 
and environmental issues. Explicit reference is made to the UN’s Declaration of Human Rights, 
the relevant International Labour Organization (ILO) Conventions, and the OECD15 Guidelines 
for Multinational Companies.
In July 2023, the Iveco Group Board of Directors approved a revised version of our Code of 
Conduct, containing an updated message from our Chairperson and CEO, as well as our new 
corporate purpose and our Values. It also emphasises our commitment to tax compliance 
through the design and implementation of a Tax Control Framework and the promotion of 
a cooperative and transparent approach to tax authorities, and it states our commitment to 
fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the workplace, with great care taken to use 
inclusive language, consistent with our DEI Playbook.
In addition to the Code of Conduct, the Company has adopted several corporate policies, 
as well as specific processes and procedures to support and complement the Code of Conduct 
by providing more detailed guidance to employees; this means that the Code should be read 
and interpreted in conjunction with these policies, processes, and procedures. Iveco Group is 
committed to adhering to its Code of Conduct, Company policies, and all applicable laws in the 
countries in which it operates. All policies referred to in the Code of Conduct are available on 
the Company’s website.

The Code of Conduct and the compliance policies are available in multiple languages in the 
Governance section of the Company’s website, as well as in the Compliance and Ethics section 
of our Intranet portal. 
Iveco Group’s Supplier Code of Conduct summarises what the Company expects from all its 
suppliers, in terms of corporate social responsibility and collaboration, to ensure we do business 
in a sustainable manner. Adopted in 2022, it is available in 6 languages and can be found on 
the Company’s website (in the Governance section), Intranet, and Supplier Portal. Compliance 
with the Supplier Code of Conduct is a mandatory requirement for continuing business relations 
with the Company.
1.4.1.1.1 Application and Dissemination
Our Code of Conduct and corporate policies apply to all members and officers of Iveco Group’s Board of 
Directors, to all employees of Iveco Group N.V ., and to all of its subsidiaries and joint ventures in which 
the Company holds a controlling interest. The Code guides our behaviour and, in principle, applies 
to anyone acting for or on behalf of the Company. Available in 7 languages (Czech, English, French, 
German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish), the Code of Conduct can be viewed and downloaded 
via our corporate website and Intranet, and hard copies are available from the HR Department. The 
principles and values of good corporate governance established in the Code of Conduct are conveyed 
to all Company employees irrespective of their level or role, through periodic training and other 
communication channels. They are also shared outside the Company, with targeted training offered to 
a number of our business partners. The 2023 Code of Conduct training course included 3 modules 
– Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption, Antitrust and Competition Law, and Speaking Out and Preventing 
Retaliation (regarding the Compliance Helpline) – made available to approximately 12,415 employees 
worldwide (salaried and above), for a total of 4,553 hours16. 
We also delivered several targeted compliance training sessions (for a total of 16,611 hours) on 
the main issues identified via a risk assessment, with a focus on:
 • Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption17
 • Antitrust and Competition Law17
 • data privacy (The GDPR and Worldwide Data Privacy Laws)
 • human rights (Professional Conduct: Supporting an Environment of Respect)
 • the Compliance Helpline (Speaking Out and Preventing Retaliation)17.
(16) Data as at 31 January 2024.
(17) Module included in the Code of Conduct training course.
Moreover, tailored anti-corruption and conflict of interest training was delivered – either in 
class or online – to the most exposed employees, identified on the basis of an internal risk 
assessment. In addition, specific training on Antitrust and Competition Law was provided to all 
members of the Senior Leadership Team (SLT). 
Outside the Company, in 2022, we provided Code of Conduct compliance training to 25% of 
the joint ventures in which Iveco Group has a controlling interest, and Supplier Code of Conduct 
training materials were made available to our suppliers through the Supplier Portal.

that they have read both the Iveco Group Code of Conduct and the Conflict of Interest Policy 
and understand their contents; and to confirm that they have no information or knowledge 
of any violation of either document that hasn’t already been disclosed to the Company. The 
employee categories involved in 2023 were: 
 • managers (all functions)
 • all Procurement employees
 • all Sales employees (eligible for the Sales Incentive Plan, or SIP).

We advocate our Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct as best practice standards in 
business ethics to our partners, suppliers, consultants, agents, dealers, and other third parties 
with whom we have long-term relationships. Our contracts with third parties include specific 
clauses relating to the recognition of, and adherence to, the fundamental principles of our 
Code of Conduct and related policies, as well as compliance with applicable laws, particularly 
those related to bribery and corruption, money laundering, antitrust/competition law, and other 
corporate criminal liabilities. 
1.4.1.2 ANTI-CORRUPTION AND BRIBERY
Specific procedures are in place at Iveco Group to ensure full compliance with applicable anti-
corruption laws. These procedures are outlined in our Anti-Corruption Policy, which is overseen 
by our Compliance function. Iveco Group’s culture of integrity requires all employees to actively 
collaborate in monitoring the policy’s enforcement, and to set an example of ethical conduct by 
reporting any potential violations – either to their managers, HR or Compliance representatives, 
or via the Compliance Helpline. The policy has been circulated to all Company employees and 
senior management worldwide and is available on the corporate website in 7 languages. 
As stated in the Anti-Corruption Policy, Iveco Group adopts a zero tolerance approach to any 
kind of bribery (the paying or offering of anything of value in order to obtain an improper 
business advantage), in particular, bribery concerning public officials, representatives of 
international organisations, and any other party connected with a public official, private entities 
or individuals as provided for by applicable laws.
The Corruption Perception Index, published by Transparency International, is generally used as 
a guide by our Compliance function in assessing and categorising the specific risks and prevalence 
of corruption in each of our countries of operation, and the type of controls needed. In addition, 
we periodically assess factors such as the risks associated with our businesses, the likelihood of a 
violation, the potential consequences, and the effectiveness of applicable internal controls. 
The Company also provides corruption prevention training, using both online and scenario-
based classroom training. 
In 2023, as part of our Code of Conduct training, an online anti-corruption course was delivered 
globally to all employees (salaried and above), broken down as per the next table.

Our employees are required to report compliance issues (including those related to corruption) 
and they can do so through various means (e.g., by reporting them to managers or through the 
Compliance Helpline). 
No violations related to corruption or bribery were reported to the Compliance Helpline 
in 2022 or 2023. 
We engage in benchmarking with peer companies to assess our approach to corruption and 
verify the consistent adoption of best prevention and detection practices. We also implement 
an internal audit programme to verify the efficiency of our corruption prevention processes and 
controls. Results are submitted to both the Senior Leadership Team (SLT) and Audit Committee, 
and we take action whenever an opportunity to improve internal controls is identified. All 
corruption allegations are duly analysed and investigated in accordance with our policies, and 
they are also tracked; we also analyse the cases reported to assess the need for further controls 
and training. Additionally, the Company surveys all employees on a yearly basis, reminding 
them of their obligation to report compliance issues. Senior employees, as well as those in 
higher risk functions, are required each year to formally disclose any potential Code of Conduct 
or conflict of interest violation of which they have knowledge.

1.4.1.2.1 Third-Party Due Diligence Process
Iveco Group implements a Third-Party Due Diligence process, designed using a specific web-
based third-party screening tool. This process gives us more insight into the specific risks posed by 
different third parties with whom we do business, based on attributes such as: location, type of 
interaction between the third party and the Company, and possible interaction between the third 
party and government officials in connection with its work for Iveco Group. The process provides 
a ranking of high-risk third parties representing the Company in the marketplace (including sales 
commission agents, trading companies, etc.). Third parties identified as posing a high risk are 
subject to variable levels of additional due diligence based on their specific risk profile. The due 
diligence process ranges from the basic screening of relevant watch lists to obtaining in-depth 
corporate intelligence reports from external diligence sources. Within the scope of this process, our 
Compliance & Ethics Committee has oversight of high-risk third-party relationships.
The Company has established a dedicated working group – composed of representatives from 
Compliance, Trade Compliance, Financial Services, and HR Security & Facilities – tasked with 
re-evaluating existing anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering practices and 
processes, as well as those related to trade compliance, while identifying opportunities to 
improve, streamline, and rationalise them in the framework of a risk-based approach. 
1.4.1.3 ANTITRUST AND COMPETITION
As stated in our Code of Conduct, Iveco Group recognises the critical importance of an open 
and competitive market, and is committed to complying with all applicable competition and 
antitrust legislation and to not engaging in business practices that may violate applicable 
antitrust or competition laws (such as the establishment of cartels, price fixing, market divisions, 
limitations with respect to production or sales, tying arrangements, the exchange of commercial 
information or business views, etc.). 
With reference to safeguarding confidential information, the Code of Conduct expressly 
indicates that the know-how, trade secrets, intellectual property, and/or other proprietary 
information developed by Iveco Group are a fundamental and critically valuable resource that 
every employee is required to protect. The Company and its subsidiaries are also required to 
protect the confidentiality of information they may receive from third parties. 
Every year, our Compliance and Ethics function collects a statement from a number of employees 
declaring they understand and adhere to the Code of Conduct (including the antitrust aspects 
contained therein), and that they have no knowledge of any violation of the Code of Conduct 
nor of any conflicts of interest that have not already been disclosed to the Company. We also 
have a programme in place to promote compliance with competition and antitrust laws, to 
raise awareness within the organisation of competition law implications for our businesses, 
and to identify and minimise the risk of any violations. This compliance programme includes 
a dedicated Competition Policy, overseen by the Legal Department and available on the 
Company’s website. This policy was updated in 2023 to include a set of relevant practical 
guidelines by subject matter, and applies to all directors, officers, and employees, as well as 
to those acting for or on behalf of all Iveco Group companies worldwide. It sets detailed and 
stringent rules to be observed when dealing with competitors, trade associations, suppliers, and 
customers, as well as rules to be observed in response to competition authority investigations, 
emphasising the need for full cooperation in the event of antitrust/competition investigations 
or any requests for information regarding alleged anti-competitive conduct. The Competition 
Policy also emphasises the importance of promptly reporting any actual or suspected policy 
violations, either to a member of the Legal and Compliance departments or anonymously using 
the Company’s Compliance Helpline.
In 2023, our online training on the Code of Conduct included a module on Antitrust and 
Competition Law that was made available to approximately 12,415 employees worldwide 
(salaried and above), for a total of 4,553 hours 18. A dedicated in-person training module 
on antitrust and competition aspects was also provided to Senior Leadership Team (SLT) 
members, and specific in-person training initiatives were deployed in some jurisdictions, to 
maintain a high level of awareness about the importance of competition law compliance. The 
Company plans to continue to follow this approach in 2024 and beyond, selecting a number 
of jurisdictions every year for ad hoc training initiatives for the business, on top of our general 
Antitrust and Competition Law course available online.

1.4.1.4 TRADE COMPLIANCE
Iveco Group is a material participant in international trade, an area of increasing focus 
where laws are complex and dynamic. We address these challenges by implementing our 
International Trade Policy, whose subject matter is also an important part of the Supplier 
Code of Conduct. In accordance with this policy, the Company is committed to complying with 
all applicable international trade laws and regulations (including import and export control 
laws; anti-boycott, anti-dumping, and anti-corruption laws; and sanction programmes). Our 
dedicated Trade Compliance function is tasked with expanding and diversifying our current 
processes (by building on existing compliance tools), to encompass and address such a dynamic 
trade environment and any relevant new regulations, while also implementing awareness 
initiatives across the organisation to ensure that new regulations are properly understood and 
taken into account when doing business.
1.4.1.5 INFORMATION SECURITY 
In today’s computerised world, new cyber risks are emerging by the hour, and simply being 
connected to the internet makes organisations susceptible to potential hacker attacks, leaving 
them constantly exposed. Cybercrime is big business, prompting organisations and governments 
worldwide to increase the resources devoted to addressing cyber threats, given the significant 
monetary and reputational risks they could face in the absence of an appropriate cybersecurity 
plan. At Iveco Group, we consider information security and the proper handling of personal 
data as core tenets, which is why we have implemented a number of dedicated controls and 
protection measures that we monitor constantly. In addition, in line with ICFR19 principles, the 
security controls for our IT infrastructure and information security management system are 
audited and certified annually by an external auditor.
1.4.1.5.1 Governance
Information security refers to all the practices and processes adopted to prevent access to or 
use, modification or deletion of data by unauthorised individuals or parties. It covers more than 
just personal data, protecting all information and data assets managed by or for Iveco Group. 
To regulate information security, we implement a set of operational procedures at global level, 
known as Information Security Policies. 
(19) Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
The Chief Information Officer (CIO) is a member of the Global Compliance & Ethics Committee, 
which is responsible for approving said Information Security Policies with regards to both 
individual employees and ICT personnel. A dedicated Cybersecurity Department within the 
ICT organisation monitors and manages information security. The head of this department, 
the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), is directly responsible for the ICT Cybersecurity 
Division, namely for coordinating security initiatives based on corporate programmes and 
business objectives while ensuring adequate protection for IT assets and technologies.
The CISO provides monthly updates on cybersecurity initiatives to the CIO and to the latter’s 
top-level managers at cybersecurity meetings. Moreover, the CIO and CISO report on the status 
of the Cybersecurity Roadmap to the Audit Committee, which normally meets quarterly.
Our security governance is based on the 5 functions of the NIST20 Cybersecurity Framework – 
Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover – designed to build an effective security culture 
and environment involving all those in security management. Our Cybersecurity Roadmap 
incorporates several initiatives aimed at ensuring effective information security governance. 
Every year, the roadmap is reviewed and defined according to the outcomes of the annual NIST 
maturity assessment, performed by a third party, that ranks Iveco Group’s position within the 
NIST framework. This assessment also identifies any gaps and areas for improvement needed to 
consolidate our Cybersecurity Roadmap and posture. The main 2023 initiatives are listed below, 
grouped according to the aforementioned NIST functions.
1.4.1.5.2 Identify
Under the Identify function, the following initiatives were set up to assist in developing our 
understanding of managing cybersecurity risks to systems, people, assets, data, and capabilities:
 • adoption of the Privileged Access Management (PAM) solution, which enables secure access to 
servers for maintenance purposes without using privileged accounts. Its initial deployment focused 
on the servers running most of the applications that fall under the Company’s ICFR21 scope
 • implementation of all type-A controls according to the requirements of the PSNC (Italy’s 
national cybersecurity perimeter) for our IDV Brand
 • implementation of an Attack Surface Management (ASM) solution (IBM Security Randori22) 
to monitor the Company’s potential vulnerability to cyber attacks 
(20) National Institute of Standards and Technology.
(21) Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
(22) One of the leading ASM solutions for tackling cyber risks.

GOVERNANCE & ECONOMIC
 • implementation of a Cloud Security Posture Management monitoring process to detect 
potential misconfigurations and suspicious activity across multiple clouds
 • adoption of a tool for performing a Shared Folders Security Review, enabling the close 
monitoring of shared areas (i.e., SharePoint sites, file servers, etc.) 
 • assessment of the resilience to ICT risks of some Iveco Group brands as per the Digital 
Operational Resilience Act (DORA), an EU regulatory framework due to come into force 
in January 2025, to determine their cybersecurity posture and define an action plan to fill 
any gaps identified.
1.4.1.5.3 Protect
The Protect function outlines appropriate safeguards to ensure delivery of critical infrastructure 
services. Initiatives deployed in 2023 focused on improvements to the security of data related 
to cloud platforms and intellectual property (IP) through a data loss prevention solution  
combined with a strengthened password policy. Such initiatives included: 
 • implementation of an Identity Threat Protection (ITP) tool to enhance the current Endpoint 
Detection and Response (EDR) solution, incorporating new, additional functionalities aimed at 
detecting and responding to threats related to identity and credentials rather than malware alone
 • implementation of an advanced Smart Internet Access system through the adoption of a 
Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) solution, which ensures safe internet browsing and VPN 
access from endpoints, anytime and anywhere, and secures internet access from sites using 
an integrated approach based on distributed cloud firewalls
 • implementation of Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) , including on exposed critical 
systems 
 • improvement of our Connected Vehicles Cybersecurity through various initiatives at specific 
plants and through new product designs
 • cloud security development to enhance the cybersecurity posture of cloud-based 
environments.
1.4.1.5.4 Detect
The Detect function’s main aim is to identify the likelihood/occurrence of a cybersecurity event.
Two ICT partners, NPO Sistemi and Kyndryl, provide support for 90% of our IT infrastructure. NPO 
Sistemi’s services are compliant with ISO 27001:2013 and ISO 9001:2015 standards. Kyndryl’s 
IT security, networking, cloud, system, and resiliency services are ISO 22301:2012-certified, 
while its IT security services are also ISO 27002:2013-compliant.
To further safeguard confidential information, we protect it against unauthorised access (both 
physical and logical) and limit the number of accounts with privileged access to it.
To prevent information security breaches , we have deployed a complex array of 
complementary measures – involving software, networks, servers, and devices assigned to 
users (such as laptops and smartphones) – to protect data when at rest, in transit or in use. Our 
data loss prevention measures include, but are not limited to: data loss prevention software, 
encryption, advanced anti-malware software, and secure data disposal

(a) An incident’s priority, from high (P0) to low (P3), is determined according to its assigned impact and urgency levels. In 2023, all 
incidents were resolved with zero impact on business activities.
Additionally, we have set up an Information Security Competence Centre dedicated to the 
security of our connected vehicle products (see 3.5.3 Product Safety and Cybersecurity  ).
Vulnerability analysis and management are essential to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, 
and availability of our sensitive information, and to maintain business continuity, protect 
our reputation, and prevent financial losses. Every effort is made to properly identify, report, 
prioritise, and remediate vulnerabilities that pose a significant risk to our Company, through a 
24/7 process that continuously checks for potential vulnerabilities.

GOVERNANCE & ECONOMIC
Risk assessments, vulnerability scanning, and penetration tests are conducted annually to 
ensure the security of our IT infrastructure and information security management systems. These 
tests include the analysis of the external attack surface  – performed using our recently 
acquired cloud-based tool – and simulated hacker attacks.
Iveco Group’s ICT Security conducts an annual information security risk assessment  to 
evaluate our cybersecurity maturity and to identify ICT risks while assessing their likelihood and 
impact. This assessment is based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and performed with 
assistance from external third parties. It is then followed up with continuous risk management 
and improvement measures. In 2023, 20 risks were downgraded to a lower risk level due to the 
implementation of new mitigation measures.
Furthermore, a number of assessments were performed specifically on our IDV Brand and our 
Financial Services business unit, considering the unique nature of these businesses.
Before the disposal of any IT asset, the IT asset management process removes all confidential 
data via a data erasure procedure. The partner in charge of fleet management oversees the 
data-sanitisation of such assets, and the activity is tracked via the asset management tool.
Our Information Security Incident Management Policy stipulates how to respond appropriately 
to any actual or suspected security incident relating to our information and/or information systems. 
Our Security Incident Response Plan, which is tested at least annually, provides a framework of 
procedures, roles, responsibilities, and accountability for incident handling, while enabling breach 
detection, analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, and follow-up in response to incidents. Our 
Security Operations Centre (SOC) is active 24/7 in preventing, detecting, and remediating security 
threats across the corporate network before any impact on business activities occurs. Additionally, 
should there be a computer security breach or incident, we have a dedicated Cyber Security Incident 
Response Team (CSIRT) that coordinates and provides support accordingly.
In 2023, we adopted a new Security Ratings platform by Panorays (in place of our former Bitsight 
solution) to measurably reduce our cyber risk: it provides data-driven, dynamic measurements 
of our cybersecurity performance and oversees the performance of our cybersecurity programme 
through broad measurement, continuous monitoring, and detailed planning. We are also using 
this platform as a third-party risk management (TPRM) solution to evaluate the potential risks 
associated with our partners that deliver ICT services. 
1.4.1.5.5 Respond and Recover
One of the main aims of these specific NIST functions is to develop our ability to take action on 
a detected cybersecurity incident and resume normal operations in a timely manner to minimise 
any impact.
Accordingly, in 2023, as part of our development of and investment in IT security, we engaged 
an external third party, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC), to implement a Crisis Management 
Plan to identify the appropriate structured processes, tools, and skills required to effectively 
manage any crisis caused by interruptions that could disrupt our core business.
1.4.1.5.6 Communication, Training, and Awareness
Every employee using our information systems receives  online training  on information 
security at least once every 3 years, while new hires receive it as part of the onboarding process. 
The Company offers a Cybersecurity Awareness programme consisting of 3 mandatory training 
modules: 
 • Protecting our Information – an entry-level information security course
 • Phishing - Don’t Take the Bait! – an anti-phishing course on avoiding scams and the theft 
of sensitive personal data
 • Smishing and Vishing – Unveil the Cheat  – a specific anti-phishing course on avoiding 
scams and the theft of sensitive personal data on mobile devices.
In 2023, all three modules were delivered to 13,654 employees worldwide, for a total of 
12,425 hours of security training.
The training programme also included simulations (5 campaigns on phishing and 5 on 
smishing, two more than in 2022) to raise employee awareness of real-world phishing attacks 
and how to recognise them. 
To mark Cybersecurity Awareness Month, a number of 60-second videos were released on our 
Intranet portal, addressing security topics like AI and chatbots, oversharing on social media,  
compromised credentials, and VPN usage. 
In addition, a specific mandatory training course on the Open Web Application Security Project 
(OWASP) was launched in October, targeting more than 200 web application developers, both 
employees and consultants. Its goal is to improve basic security awareness and knowledge 
when implementing software for web applications.

GOVERNANCE & ECONOMIC
Our Intranet features 2 dedicated sections – Email and Instant Messaging Guidelines  and 
Information Security  – outlining the most widespread types of malicious/suspicious 
messages (spam, phishing, spear-phishing, etc.), with tips and instructions on identifying them 
and on when and how to notify ICT Security.
1.4.1.6 DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY
Iveco Group implements specific data privacy rules and regulations that govern the way we 
collect and handle personal data (whether in digital or other form) from start to finish, i.e., 
from processing to use, transfer, sharing, possession, and disposal. As stated in our Code of 
Conduct, we are committed to collecting, storing, and processing personal data in compliance 
with all applicable laws, respecting individuals’ rights and minimising data treatment to the 
fullest extent possible. To this end, the Company has built and is continually expanding its own 
Privacy Management framework: a set of policies, guidelines, tools, skills, and resources aimed 
at ensuring compliance with multiple data privacy regulations around the world. 
The Privacy Management framework includes:
 • organisational and technical measures to ensure correct and secure data processing, 
according to the Company’s Data Privacy Policy and the Privacy by Design principle 
 • procedures to collect and respond to privacy-related enquiries from data subjects
 • a comprehensive record of data processing activities, including personal data retention 
schedules/criteria
 • third-party data management.
Compliance with data privacy regulations is monitored by a dedicated unit within our General 
Counsel function, and may be subject to audits by the Internal Audit function.  
In 2023, 12,284 employees worldwide received training on the appropriate handling of 
personal information, for a total of 6,570 hours. In line with the Company’s guidelines, online 
data privacy training will be provided to all employees at least once every 3 years.
During the year, Iveco Group received no substantiated complaints concerning breaches of 
privacy.
1.4.2 Our Control Systems
Integrity and ethics are the principles on which Iveco Group is founded, and intrinsic to all 
its business practices. One of our 5 Values, We do what is right, is a perfect example of such 
principles, and we understand that acting with integrity requires vigilance and commitment. 
We also believe these principles boost our competitiveness, and are a steppingstone to our 
sustainable growth and to building a reputation that our customers, employees, and other 
stakeholders can trust and rely on. Furthermore, it is through our strong integrity and ethics 
culture that we prevent ethics violations.
While we strive to implement these principles in everything we do, we believe they are 
particularly important regarding our compliance with regulations or standards that promote 
sustainable development (such as those related to value distribution, progressive taxation, cash 
transfers, and investments in our people), or that support inclusive growth. 
To further strengthen its integrity, the Company has adopted the following control tools, 
implemented by our departments as appropriate:
 • whistleblowing procedures, overseen by the Compliance function 
 • periodic auditing, overseen by the Internal Audit function
 • monitoring of legal violations, overseen by the Legal Department.
1.4.2.1 WHISTLEBLOWING PROCEDURES
At Iveco Group, employees are encouraged to actively engage in the detection and prevention 
of misconduct by reporting any activity that violates applicable laws, the Code of Conduct 
or Company policies. Reporting potential violations gives the Company the opportunity to 
investigate matters and take corrective action, reducing the risk or potential damage to the 
employee in question, co-workers, the Company itself, or the communities in which it operates.
In 2022, we established a Compliance Helpline , a global reporting tool available in 15 
languages managed by an independent third party. It was set up following consultation 
with representatives from many different functions, including HR, Internal Audit, Legal, and 
Compliance. This communication channel provides our employees, customers, suppliers, and 
other third parties with a dedicated means to report potential violations of applicable laws, the 
Code of Conduct, the Supplier Code of Conduct, or Company policies.

GOVERNANCE & ECONOMIC
As indicated in the Compliance Helpline Policy and on Iveco Group’s website23, reports can be 
submitted (including anonymously, where permitted by law) in the following ways:
 • in person to a manager or other Company representative
 • through the dedicated Compliance Helpline section23 on our corporate website 
 • through the dedicated app, available for Android and iOS
 • through dedicated phone lines (calls are directed to a voice mailbox managed by a third 
party; messages are then transcribed and sent to us anonymously).
Iveco Group employees have an obligation to report misconduct. The Compliance Helpline is an 
important tool meant to encourage reporting and foster a culture of individual and collective 
responsibility for compliance and ethics. This culture is also promoted via our Speaking Up 
global communication campaigns, rolled-out in 2022 and targeting employees worldwide. In 
2023, a communication was circulated throughout the Company to commend the contributions 
of those who bravely stepped forward to expose waste, fraud, and abuse and to raise awareness 
of the importance of the helpline. The Legal and Compliance newsletter containing an article on 
the latest updates to the Compliance Helpline was also posted on our Intranet portal.
During the year, we implemented a brand-new Compliance Helpline system that is more aligned 
with the Company’s needs following the spin-off. The new system has also allowed us to make 
additional local whistleblowing channels available in those countries where the law establishes 
that each legal entity with more than 249 employees must have its own reporting channel, 
which they can use in addition to Iveco Group’s central Compliance Helpline. 
Company policy protects anyone reporting a concern in good faith from retaliation of any 
kind. We also respond to every report submitted through the Compliance Helpline. A global 
case management system, implemented in conjunction with the Compliance Helpline, helps 
us ensure the accurate tracking and timely resolution of investigations, which are primarily 
conducted by the Internal Audit, HR, Legal, and/or Compliance functions.
(23) See Compliace Helpline  
The materiality of all reported matters is evaluated according to criteria approved by the 
Compliance & Ethics Committee. Whether a matter is defined as material depends on aspects 
such as the extent of the potential penalties or monetary losses involved, the seniority of 
the implicated person, or the nature of the alleged violation. Matters defined as material are 
escalated to the Investigation Oversight Sub-Committee (IOS), comprising representatives from 
HR, Internal Audit, and the General Counsel, which  oversees the investigation process and 
agrees on the necessary corrective actions and disciplinary measures. In general, matters with 
the potential to incur penalties or monetary losses in excess of €100,000, or that involve 
allegations against a director or above, or that relate to bribery, fraud, trade compliance, 
accounting or internal controls, are all considered material. Summaries of all such material 
matters, which are collected by geographic area, are reported to the Compliance & Ethics 
Committee and the Audit Committee. 
In 2023, 4 cases were classified as material and reported to the IOS, the Compliance & Ethics 
Committee, and the Audit Committee. 
During the year, the Chief Compliance Officer provided the Audit Committee with a quarterly 
update on the Company’s compliance and ethics activities. Information regularly communicated 
to the Audit Committee relates to: training activities, risk assessment results, emerging 
compliance risks, updates on material compliance and ethics projects, Compliance Helpline 
reports and related statistics, the status of closed and ongoing investigations, and a summary 
of material matters. If a reported matter is substantiated, the Company implements appropriate 
disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. In this regard, the 
Compliance & Ethics Committee has approved specific disciplinary guidelines, so as to clearly 
communicate its expectations with respect to appropriate disciplinary actions and ensure a 
consistent disciplinary approach.

are notified to the relevant corporate departments and senior management. 
In 2023, the Company disclosed the results of 19 internal audits conducted at its main 
operational sites, regarding compliance with anti-corruption and bribery obligations, other 
regulatory requirements, and with the Human Rights Policy, as well as investigations linked to 
matters reported through the Compliance Helpline. The audits revealed substantial compliance 
with the main standards in force. Any violations relating to aspects included in the Code of 
Conduct were managed either through appropriate disciplinary action or through action plans 
to improve internal control procedures. The Internal Audit Department also implemented a 
programme to verify the adherence of Iveco Group’s dealers and authorised workshops to 
vehicle Warranty Manuals, performing 50 third-party dealer audits.

1.4.2.3 FINAL RULINGS AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
1.4.2.3.1 Significant Final Rulings
In this section, Iveco Group reports final court judgments or final arbitration awards that 
individually had an adverse material effect on the Company (referred to as ‘significant final 
rulings’).
In 2023, no significant final rulings were issued against the Company for violations of laws 
in the following areas: environment; rights of local communities and impacts on society; human 
rights; marketing and advertising; taxes; privacy and loss of customer data; anti-competitive 
behaviour and antitrust; intellectual property; contractual liability; product responsibility; 
product and service information and labelling; sales of banned or disputed products; anti-
corruption and anti-bribery; and labour and social security.
1.4.2.3.2 European Commission Settlement
In 2011, Iveco S.p.A. (hereinafter IVECO) – which, following the demerger, became part of 
Iveco Group N.V . – and its competitors in the European Union were subject to an investigation 
by the European Commission (hereinafter the ‘Commission’) into certain business practices in 
the European Union (in the period 1997-2011) in relation to medium and heavy-duty trucks. 
On 19 July 2016, the Commission announced a settlement (hereinafter the ‘Decision’) with 
CNH Industrial, which included a settlement with IVECO. Specifically, IVECO received a reduced 
fine of €494.6 million in exchange for cooperating with the European Commission throughout 
the investigation. Similar decisions were taken by the Commission with reference to other 
competitors. Following the Decision, CNH Industrial N.V ., IVECO, and IVECO Magirus AG (IMAG) 
were named as defendants in many proceedings across Europe and Israel. The extent and 
outcome of these claims cannot be predicted at this time. It is in any case beyond doubt that the 
matters in question are associated with a company that was very different – in terms of culture 
and management – from the current Iveco Group. Furthermore, the Company is committed 
to delivering regular training and to raising management awareness of the importance of 
always complying with competition laws wherever we operate and has, since the investigation, 
implemented a robust antitrust compliance programme aimed at preventing similar conduct 
from happening in the future (see 1.4.1.3 Antitrust and Competition  ).
1.4.2.3.3 FPT Industrial Emissions Investigation
On 22 July 2020, a number of CNH Industrial’s offices in Europe were visited by investigators in 
the context of a request for assistance by the public prosecutors of Frankfurt am Main, Germany 
(later transferred to the public prosecutor’s office in Stuttgart, Germany) and Turin, Italy, in 
relation to alleged non-compliance of two engine models produced by FPT Industrial S.p.A., 
which is now part of Iveco Group. The Italian criminal investigation was concluded in 2023. As 
a result of our full cooperation and ongoing discussions with the investigative authorities, the 
German criminal investigation was also concluded in December 2023. We are also defending 
individual civil claims alleging emissions non-compliance in Germany and Austria. We cannot 
predict at this time the extent and outcome of these individual claims and therefore we did not 
recognise any specific provision in relation thereto. 
1.4.2.3.4 Provisions
As a global Company with a diverse business portfolio, Iveco Group is exposed to numerous 
legal risks in the ordinary course of its business, including, without limitation, dealer and 
supplier litigations, intellectual property right disputes, product warranty and defective product 
claims, product performance, asbestos, personal injuries, regulatory and contractual issues, 
competition law, anti-corruption laws, and other investigation and environmental claims. 
While the Company is committed to regularly revising and reassessing its risk exposure in legal 
proceedings, the outcomes of any current or future proceedings, claims or investigations cannot 
be predicted with certainty. Adverse decisions in one or more of these proceedings, claims or 
investigations could require Iveco Group to pay substantial damages or fines or undertake 
service actions, recall campaigns or other costly actions.

When it is probable that an outflow of resources incorporating economic benefits will be required to 
settle current or future obligations, and this amount can be reliably estimated, Iveco Group recognises 
specific provisions for this purpose (for details, see the 2023 Annual Report, Note 23). 
1.4.2.3.5 Labour and Social Security Disputes
Labour and social security disputes culminating in final court judgments in 2023 involved a total 
payout of 0.01% of labour costs for the year.
In Brazil, such judgments, mainly relating to the interpretation of particularly controversial 
legislation, accounted for 56% of all such judgments against the Company, or approximately 
29% of the Company’s total payout. However, in the specific context of South America, these 
judgments were not exceptional in nature or in number.
In France, on the basis of a claim made by a trade union, a final court judgment was issued 
against the Company recognising the right of the claimant to modest compensation. The trade 
union claimed that the bonus allocation clause of the profit-sharing agreement entered into in 
2014 with 3 trade unions (including the same trade union making the claim) was discriminatory, 
envisaging a double payment for the employees with no absences during the year and for those 
with up to 5 days of sick leave. Such a clause was found to be invalid (but only prospectively, 
with effect from the date of the judgement), as it differentiates between the employees striking 
for up to 5 days and the employees on sick leave for up to 5 days. The contested clause is no 
longer included in profit-sharing agreements.
1.4.3 Public Policy and Interest 
Representation
Iveco Group’s participation in the debate on shaping public policy and defining regulations on 
issues that affect its business, as well as the communities in which it operates, is fundamental 
to help develop workable international standards and guidelines and thus preserve the value 
of its investments. Indeed, this type of engagement, combined with the promotion of public-
private relationships, is crucial to identifying innovative, shared sustainability solutions built on 
high-level standards and guidelines.
In our dialogue with governments, international organisations, local authorities, sector 
associations, and other stakeholders, we contribute our technical expertise and knowledge on 
policies concerning the automotive industry and other sectors related to the transport of people 
and goods, with a focus on products, processes, sustainable mobility, and innovation. We firmly 
believe in contributing to society’s technological advancement, and in cooperating with public 
institutions, universities, and other organisations on research and development into innovative 
solutions in the fields in which we operate. As a result of our proactive approach to external 
institutions, we are able to identify new product development and business opportunities early 
on, and create competitive business conditions that are sustainable over the long term. 
The highest responsibility for Iveco Group’s Public Affairs lies with the Senior Leadership Team (SLT). 
The Public Affairs function is responsible at global level for overseeing advocacy activities, supporting 
our engagement with institutions and stakeholders, and interacting daily with the departments and 
functions of both the Company and its brands. In detail, these responsibilities include: 
 • monitoring future policy trends and engaging with public authorities, trade associations, 
international organisations, the business sector, and NGOs on the institutional and 
regulatory decision-making processes that affect Iveco Group’s product and operations 
strategies
 • advocating with policy makers and other relevant stakeholders
 • protecting and enhancing the Company’s and brands’ profiles and strategies, by proactively 
interacting with external stakeholders and participating in public dialogue
 • supporting our business goals by addressing specific business issues and identifying 
opportunities in the context of institutional and/or diplomatic relations.

1.4.3.1 LOBBYING AND COMPLIANCE WITH STRATEGY AND POLICIES
Interest representation is conducted only where permitted by and in strict compliance with 
applicable laws, including anti-corruption and antitrust laws, and in full compliance with 
our Code of Conduct and related policies and procedures. Iveco Group is registered with the 
European Transparency Register, which is operated jointly by the European Parliament, the 
Council of the European Union, and the European Commission and provides information about 
interest representatives that seek to contribute to the European Union’s decision-making 
processes; the register also provides a code of conduct to regulate their activities. 
In Italy, the Company is also registered with the Italian Transparency Register, set up by the 
Italian Ministry of Economic Development and adopted by drawing upon the same model 
applied across other European institutions, and with the Register of Interest Representatives 
of the Italian Chamber of Deputies. In France, Iveco Group brands are also registered with the 
High Authority for Transparency in Public Life; in Spain, with the Transparency Register of the 
Community of Madrid; and in Germany, with the Lobby Register for interest representation in 
the German Bundestag and Federal Government. 
Iveco Group abides by its US Lobbying Activities and Other Contacts with US Government 
Officials, a compliance policy24 implemented in relation to our Code of Conduct that regulates 
relations with public institutions. 
Our relationships with various types of public and private organisations (including universities 
and research centres) also fall under the purview of our Environmental Policy, since the 
organisations we deal with are stakeholders and our climate change commitments require 
their engagement, in accordance with the objectives of the Paris Agreement.
In order to report potential violations of corporate policies, the Code of Conduct, or applicable 
laws, we have established a dedicated grievance mechanism, the Compliance Helpline, which 
can also be used to report specific violations concerning relations with public institutions.
(24) Compliance policies are available in the Compliance and Ethics section of the Company’s Intranet site.
The Company is a member of many industry and other associations, and of national and 
international advocacy organisations, in which it plays a significant role. The complete list of 
such bodies is available in 4.3.1.1 Membership of Associations  .
In 2023, Iveco Group’s membership fees for trade associations, lobbying activities (including 
climate-related), etc. totalled about €2.1 million globally.

1.4.3.2 PARTNERING WITH TRADE ASSOCIATIONS  
TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE
As a member of various sector associations, Iveco Group is committed to contributing to the 
development of climate change policies and of regulations and standards for the capital goods 
industry, mainly by promoting the use of alternative powertrain solutions and innovative 
vehicles, while participating in the institutional and public debate around mitigating climate 
change and improving air quality. 
In particular, our Public Affairs function focuses on increasing the awareness and active participation 
of institutional stakeholders, the public, and international organisations with regards to:
 • the importance of key issues related to Iveco Group’s product strategy and related 
advocacy, such as sustainable mobility, alternative fuels and propulsions (e.g., natural gas, 
biomethane, hydrogen, and electric and hybrid vehicles), the decarbonisation of transport, 
the reduction of emissions from vehicles and manufacturing, digitalisation, safety, and 
autonomous driving  
 • Iveco Group’s corporate positioning on sustainability, climate change, renewable energy, 
the circular economy, transportation systems, safety, and product innovation.
In 2023, to foster public debate and policy making on the most relevant matters for 
sustainability, such as tackling climate change, we organised and actively participated in 
institutional webinars, conferences, working groups, roundtables, initiatives, and virtual and 
in-person meetings. 
Our fight against climate change at national and global level also includes playing an active 
role as a member of various industry and multi-stakeholder associations, organisations, 
business networks, and think tanks, as part of our commitment to verifying that they operate in 
accordance with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and with our decarbonisation roadmap. 
We conduct an annual review of these associations’ alignment with Iveco Group’s strategy, to 
address among other things any misalignment between their climate change policies and the 
Company’s own climate position.
The following are some examples of the main trade associations that we have engaged with 
during the year that share our position on climate change. 
Partnerships to Fight Climate Change
Trade Association: 
European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA)
Position on climate change 
We share ACEA’s vision for a sustainable future for the transport sector, supporting alternative, 
carbon-neutral fuels and zero-emission technologies to meet the EU’s goals while also focusing 
on safety requirements, circularity, materials and substances, as well as on future trends such as 
automated driving, connectivity, and smart mobility.
Iveco Group is represented both on ACEA’s Board of Directors (BOD) and on its Commercial Vehicle 
Board of Directors (CV BOD), which are composed, respectively, of the CEOs of the member 
companies and the CEOs of the commercial vehicle member companies. 
We also participate in ACEA’s technical working groups and task forces, which are composed of 
experts from member companies who work directly on tackling climate change (e.g., emissions, 
circularity, alternative fuels), safety, materials and substances, trade, alternative fuels, etc.
Climate change is a global challenge that demands collective action and international cooperation; 
a challenge to which the automotive industry will make a key contribution to achieving net-zero 
emissions and carbon neutrality. The European automobile industry is a world leader in technology 
and clean vehicles – with regard to both production and use – and Europe’s number one investor in 
R&D, responsible for 33% of total EU spending on innovation. Much of this goes towards developing 
fuel-efficient technologies and reducing the environmental impact of products and processes. 
ACEA sees the revision and adaptation of vehicle regulations (e.g., those related to the CO2 emissions 
of cars, vans, and heavy-duty vehicles, Euro 7 standards, circularity, and product sustainability) 
as a crucial step in decarbonising road transport and advancing towards enhanced sustainability, 
circularity, and innovation. It also advocates the importance of supportive measures and conditions, 
and of a consistent policy framework, as key enablers of the energy transition in road transport.

Partnerships to Fight Climate Change
Trade Association: 
Hydrogen Europe
Position on climate change 
As a member of Hydrogen Europe, Iveco Group actively participates in several of the association’s 
working groups (e.g., Mobility, Heavy Duty, Sustainability, Funding and Finance, Advocacy) and in 
its Technical Committee. We also participate in the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance 25 and in its 
Mobility Roundtable, representing the road transport industry and contributing to the development 
of a sustainable and competitive industrial-hydrogen economy in the EU. 
Moreover, the Company actively contributes to the association’s H2ero Net Zero strategy, aimed at 
removing barriers to hydrogen investments, contributing to policy making, enabling the development 
of clean hydrogen technologies, and scaling their deployment to deliver net zero by 2050.
Hydrogen Europe brings together various industry players, large companies, and SMEs that support 
the delivery of hydrogen and fuel-cell technologies. Through its partnership with Iveco Group and 
involvement in both the EU Clean Hydrogen Alliance and Important Projects of Common European 
Interest (IPCEI), the association collaborates with public authorities to achieve this objective.
Hydrogen Europe is also actively involved in public private partnerships (PPP) supporting research, 
technological development, and practical demos regarding fuel-cell and hydrogen technologies in 
Europe. Its main policies focus on the role of hydrogen technology as the key to decarbonising the 
EU’s economy, while ensuring essential investments are channelled towards hydrogen applications 
and projects in time to meet the 2030 climate targets.

(25) Initiative of the European Commission and Hydrogen Europe.
Trade Association: 
Brazilian Association of Automotive Vehicle Manufacturers (ANFAVEA)
Position on climate change 
Iveco Group is a member of ANFAVEA, an association established in 1956 comprising 26 members 
from the passenger car, commercial vehicle, and agricultural machinery industries. The Company is 
an active member of ANFAVEA’s Board of Directors and of several of its committees (including Heavy 
Duty, Environment, Safety, Legislative).
The association advocates for decarbonisation in the transport sector, supporting the introduction 
of a diverse range of carbon-neutral solutions including biomethane and other biofuels, hydrogen, 
and electrification. ANFAVEA has taken a leading role in discussions with the Brazilian government 
on the development of policies to reduce carbon emissions. A special focus has been on creating 
a framework to incentivise the local development of new technologies in collaboration with public 
institutions, universities, and research centres. As part of this effort, the Brazilian government 
launched the Route 2030 – Logistics and Mobility Program that, among other things, established a 
mechanism enabling automakers to allocate funds to specific strategic projects. 
ANFAVEA has also taken a prominent stance in supporting fleet renewal initiatives, since it is 
estimated that Brazil has over 500,000 trucks and buses that are more than 20 years old. Beyond 
the considerable environmental repercussions, vehicles approaching their end of life contribute 
significantly to accidents and traffic congestion. For this reason, the association has advocated for 
national and state-level fleet renewal programmes to assist truck and bus owners in acquiring newer 
vehicles and to ensure the proper disposal of end-of-life vehicles.

1.4.3.3 POLITICAL PARTIES
Iveco Group employs the highest standards of transparency and integrity in any and all 
relationships it has with political parties, as well as with their representatives or candidates 
(collectively referred to as Political Parties). Financial contributions to Political Parties are only 
allowed where permitted by law and must be authorised at the appropriate level within each 
legal entity. 
In 2023, no contributions were made to Political Parties. An employee’s political affiliation 
or financial contribution is considered a personal matter and is completely voluntary, including 
contributions made through a Political Action Committee (PAC).
1.5 Risks and Opportunities
1.5.1 Risk Management
1.5.1.1 IVECO GROUP RISK MANAGEMENT
In the course of its business, Iveco Group is exposed, like all organisations of any type and 
size, to internal and external challenges that make both the market and the achievement of 
strategic and business objectives uncertain. In order to effectively manage our business risks 
and achieve our strategic goals in an increasingly unpredictable environment, we have adopted 
an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) system in line with the main national and international 
best practices. This system enables the systematic identification, assessment, management, 
and monitoring of business risks (including environmental, social, and governance); it 
is combined with a coordinated and balanced application of resources, so as to minimise, 
monitor, and control the probability or impact of adverse events or to optimise the realisation 
of opportunities. Risk management is an important component of our overall corporate culture 
and is integral to the achievement of our long-term goals.
The ERM function is headed by the Chief Risk and Internal Audit Officer, who reports 
hierarchically to the CEO and functionally to the Audit Committee, so ensuring independence 
from the business units. The function helps the Company effectively manage and implement 
the risk management framework through facilitation, coordination, monitoring, and 
methodological support. 
The ERM process is also integrated with the strategic sustainability targets of our Sustainability 
Plan, the aspirational goals set out in our Strategic Business Plan, and employee and customer 
safety goals. These targets and goals provide a framework to address the long-term challenges 
of creating value for stakeholders and proactively mitigating their associated risks. 
Our ERM process is based on the framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), as well as on the principles of the Dutch 
Corporate Governance Code (DCGC), and adapted for specific business requirements by 
incorporating Company management expertise and best practices.

Other risks
A risk assessment is a detailed evaluation of the risk events that could impact our strategic 
and management objectives; it takes into account changes in our business and organisational 
model and in our processes and procedures, developments in the external environment 
(from a political, economic, social, technological, and legal perspective), and our industry and 
competitors. The process follows an integrated top-down and bottom-up approach, evaluating 
our residual exposure to current risks as well as our exposure to emerging risks associated with 
the ongoing and evolving internal and external context. 
Although risk assessment is a process that is ongoing throughout the year, a dedicated report 
on our current risk exposure is submitted at least twice yearly (usually in July and December) to 
the Audit Committee, which in turn is required to provide a review of the report. Furthermore, all 
Company levels involved in ERM receive periodic updates and training during the year on ERM 
activities and processes. For example, in 2023, our management and control bodies received 
regular information on so-called ‘black swan’ events, cyber risks, the impacts of climate change, 
our ERM Policy, and the definition of our Risk Appetite Framework.
The 2023 ERM process identified 76 risks, several of which related to significant risk areas such 
as business strategies and operations, competitive factors, social responsibility, environmental 
issues, and regulatory compliance (better detailed in the Risk Factors section of the 2023 
Annual Report). 
According to their likelihood of occurrence and the evaluation of their potential impacts, risks 
are categorised as Top 1, Top 2, or Other Risks, as illustrated in the following matrix:
According to their likelihood of occurrence and potential impacts (both evaluated on a scale from 1 to 4), risks are categorised as Top 1, Top 2, or Other Risks. 

Page 52:
We Go Beyond52 Governance Bodies Ethical Behaviour Risk and Opportunities Creating Prosperity
GOVERNANCE & ECONOMIC
Direct feedback received from each Company level, up to and including the Board of Directors, 
is then used to identify and develop risk mitigation activities as necessary within the business 
or functional area in question, which are subsequently executed by management. These 
activities are designed to mitigate adverse impacts on our strategic goals and on our financial 
and operational performance. We have put in place a robust risk management process and 
internal control system; however, it is not possible to predict, identify or eliminate all risks and 
uncertainties that could impact our business. 
In 2023, within the scope of the ERM process, we have also identified and assessed our climate-
related risks and opportunities (see 2.1 Mitigating Climate Change  ). 
1.5.1.2 EMERGING RISKS
The ERM process also monitors emerging risks, defined as new risks or risks for which the 
impacts are unknown or evolving, and which may therefore be incorporated into risk 
assessment and mitigation activities when appropriate. In 2023, the key emerging risks with 
the potential for significant impact on Iveco Group over the long term (more than 3 years) 
were those associated with the mass availability of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and 
with possible geopolitical developments (as described in the Risk Factors section of the 2023 
Annual Report). 
Despite the significant opportunities offered by AI, it also presents several potential challenges, 
including: increasing and ever-more sophisticated cyberattacks, issues over data privacy and 
sensitive information, intellectual property issues, and difficulties in keeping pace with evolving 
regulations, which may affect a significant part of our operations and require us to adapt our 
strategy. The potential unique competitive advantage and industry disruption offered by new 
generative AI products and business models will require investments in transformational use 
cases, resulting in greater costs, complexity, and risk. This in turn will demand a higher risk 
tolerance, as well as new investment criteria that prioritise strategic value over task- or process-
specific productivity benefits. In order to minimise risk exposure, we have started to implement 
specific mitigating measures, including the provision of adequate training, policy development, 
and solutions/tools, and the continuous monitoring of regulatory changes.
The evolving expectations of possible geopolitical developments increase geopolitical risk, 
particularly regarding political and financial instability and the exacerbation of military conflicts. 
The latter may potentially lead to trade tensions that may escalate into further decoupling, which 
in turn may directly or indirectly affect countries where we operate. The main consequences 
arising from instability or from the exacerbation of existing conflicts and geopolitical risk may 
include supply chain disruption, oil and gas price volatility, terrorist attacks, cyberattacks, and 
lower sales due to sanctions and trade restrictions, which could have an adverse effect on 
our business model, operating results, and financial situation. Our mitigation activities include 
maintaining relations with local authorities, ensuring regular negotiations, and avoiding 
operations in countries under sanctions.
1.5.1.3 RISK APPETITE
In 2023, we adopted a Risk Appetite Framework as a comprehensive and structured approach 
to proactively managing risks while pursuing our strategic objectives. This framework clearly 
and concisely outlines our approach to risk, supporting the Company in navigating uncertainties 
and opportunities with confidence, fostering sustainable growth, and ensuring the protection 
of stakeholders’ interests.
Our risk appetite is set within risk taking and risk acceptance parameters driven by our Strategic 
Business Plan, Code of Conduct, core principles and Values, policies, and applicable laws. To 
protect the interest of our stakeholders, we have defined the following levels of risk appetite:
 • tolerant: high tolerance to risk occurrence, meaning Iveco Group is willing to accept risk 
exposure in pursuing its business objectives 
 • moderately tolerant: moderate tolerance to risk occurrence, meaning Iveco Group is 
comfortable with risk within certain limits
 • moderately averse: aversion to risk occurrence, meaning Iveco Group seeks to minimise the 
occurrence and consequences of unforeseen risks 
 • averse: no acceptance of risks, meaning Iveco Group’s priority is to avoid risk occurrence. 

Page 53:
We Go Beyond53 Governance Bodies Ethical Behaviour Risk and Opportunities Creating Prosperity
GOVERNANCE & ECONOMIC
The Risk Appetite Framework considers, among other things, risk dimensions, i.e., key areas 
where our risk appetite is explicitly defined. These are identified based on a comprehensive 
analysis of industry challenges, our business model, Values, strategic objectives, and ERM risk 
assessment outcomes. For the following risk dimensions, an averse risk appetite has been 
approved:
 • ethics and integrity
 • lawsuits and litigation
 • environment, health, and safety (EHS)
 • compliance with corporate law and regulations
 • product safety
 • human rights.
Other main risks dimensions are classified as having a risk appetite from moderately averse to 
moderately tolerant.
1.5.1.4 ENHANCEMENTS TO THE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS 
The development and implementation of an effective and robust Enterprise Risk Management 
(ERM) process requires ongoing evaluation and improvement. For this reason, we continuously 
enhance our risk management process in compliance with Company principles and international 
best practices. The evolving ERM model comprises the following spheres: 
 • risk governance: which provides a general framework as regards roles, responsibilities, and 
information flows for managing the Company’s main risks 
 • process: which covers all groups of activities implemented by the various actors involved 
to identify, measure, manage, and monitor the main risks that could affect our ability to 
achieve our objectives 
 • reporting: which represents the results of our risk assessment and risk monitoring activities, 
highlighting the most significant risks in terms of likelihood and potential impact, as well 
as our plans for dealing with them. 
In 2023, in order to strengthen our ERM process, the ERM function issued our first ERM Policy 
and our Risk Appetite Framework, while our risk assessment was carried out in parallel with 
the development of our 2024-28 Strategic Business Plan. We also integrated a bottom-up risk 
assessment approach into the latter starting from our existing risk portfolio, which is based on 
an assessment of black swan events, emerging risks, and residual exposure to current risks. 
It should be noted that our 2023 risk assessment includes the main outcomes of our climate 
change risk management process, with the most significant climate-related physical and 
transition risks incorporated into our ERM risk catalogue.
Approximately 20 new risks were identified through this approach. For details on the main 
differences compared to the previous year, see the Risk Factors section of the 2023 Annual 
Report.
As we further develop our ERM process, we aim for a more in-depth quantification of risks 
based on the forecasts of our Strategic Business Plan, and for a direct link with our sustainability 
objectives and our Values. 
1.5.1.5 RISK TRANSFER 
In order to mitigate the unpredictability and financial impact of any detrimental event that is 
insurable, Iveco Group has transferred the respective residual risk exposure to the insurance 
market. Over the years, our changing needs have been clearly reflected in our insurance 
coverage, which has been regularly optimised to decrease our exposure to intrinsic risks 
related to the type of activities we carry out. Global insurance programmes ensure that all our 
companies currently have key risk insurance coverage. The latter includes property (all risks), 
general liability and umbrella excess liability, directors’ and officers’ liability, public offering of 
securities, cyber risk and potential fraud, and environmental liability.
Additional coverage has been arranged locally based on the specific requirements of local 
legislation or of collective labour agreements and/or corporate agreements or regulations, such 
as coverage of product liability, employment practices or general third-party liability. Insurance 
analysis and the transfer of Iveco Group’s risk exposure are conducted in collaboration 
with highly respected insurance brokers, which support this process internationally and are 
responsible for the compliance and management of our insurance programmes at global level.

1.5.2 Supply Chain Risk Management
Any company managing risk proactively must focus not just on its own risk, but also on any 
risk within its supply chain. This dual aspect makes supply chain risk management a priority. 
In 2022, our first year as Iveco Group, we developed a new tool called EVA, which has since fully 
replaced the Company’s former Strategy Reporting tool, providing the same key information 
as its predecessor in addition to several other procurement-specific KPIs. The new tool also 
features a one-page CPO dashboard providing the Chief Procurement Officer with a highly 
detailed summary of supplier performance and reliability information, including a list of the 
most critical suppliers from a business and/or financial perspective. 
In 2023, EVA was enriched with a Purchasing Scorecard that shows different KPIs on a single 
page to provide an overview of the main indicators specific to procurement. This new feature 
allows the user to drill down into each KPI, view trends, and analyse business, quality, and 
financial indicators, in order to evaluate any potential risks and make more informed decisions. 
This is among the reasons why we consider EVA an important business tool, helping the 
Company’s decision-making process by using risk management to anticipate, highlight, and 
prevent potential risk exposures.
Our overall supplier financial risk management process, which is overseen through a tool called 
TIGRAN developed between late 2021 and early 2022, is linked with EVA and with all other 
tools that require supplier financial risk information. TIGRAN ensures the timely updating 
of financial evaluations, either through links with external providers that supply the most 
recently published official data, or through manual input by analysts from the Supplier Risk 
Management team. In critical situations, analysts can upload and update the TIGRAN platform 
with interim financial data, if deemed necessary to enhance control over financial risk. The 
platform’s access to other finance or business areas is currently undergoing testing for release 
in 2024, with different user profiles already developed that grant permissions based on the 
user’s specific role within the Company.

1.6.1 Driving Operations Together 
The Driving Operations Together  (DOT) programme is Iveco Group’s new results-oriented 
approach for continuous improvement, designed to optimise our operations worldwide and 
incorporate sustainability into our processes. The programme brings a new managerial focus to 
drive accountability and a more entrepreneurial mindset across all business areas.
The DOT holistic model aims to deliver this vision by sustaining a culture of operational 
excellence across all Company processes. It is targeted at reducing waste, increasing margins, 
and improving performance across all our value streams, and ultimately at adapting rapidly to 
change.
The DOT Model provides for: 
A Vision, which summarises the programme’s aspirations and future direction, in line with our organisation’s overall purpose. 
The 4 key Focus Areas in which we aim to excel to achieve our vision.
A series of key Enablers such as: innovating with digitalisation; engaging all necessary stakeholders; implementing a robust management system; and ensuring a governance structure to 
sustain cultural change. All of which will help us achieve our DOT objectives. 
Lastly, it provides for specific Guiding Principles that support our objectives and steer us in the achievement of specific targets on the journey towards our vision.

This results-driven approach ensures all of our people are working towards the same goals, 
contributing to the achievement of operational excellence in all business practices. In the short-
to-medium term, the DOT programme will engage all personnel involved in manufacturing and 
supply chain operations, using parallel processes. It will entail applying a set of standards in 
manufacturing to meet both key performance indicators (KPIs) and performance targets, while 
analysing processes within the supply chain so as to optimise them. 
Our DOT model provides for 10 fields of application (i.e., intervention areas), each associated 
with 11 functional commitments that help corporate functions achieve their objectives and 
ensure that each field’s targets are met through the application of a specific set of standards. 
Indeed, this structure enables us to apply technical KPIs and KAIs (key activity indicators), as 
well as corporate performance metrics, to any Company activity. An intrinsic aspect of the DOT 
system is benchmarking, which enables technical content to be dynamically updated to steer 
processes towards the best applications and best market practices.
The DOT programme is built on competitiveness, engagement, and recognition. Skills 
management and information sharing on our technical performance and on the programme’s 
implementation will help us develop expertise and embrace new opportunities, thereby 
supporting growth. This innovative framework guides our new strategy in terms of performance, 
digitalisation, and competitiveness, ensuring common goals for everyone involved in our pursuit 
of operational excellence. Its effective governance and project management are fundamental for 
programme implementation and key to sustaining its momentum, steering actions, increasing 
accountability, and promoting teamwork.
Our DOT programme will further help us pursue several objectives. These include: achieving zero defects on products and processes, zero serious events, and zero environmental impact; 
building competitive sites; creating the teams of the future; improving the efficiency of our structures and processes and the effectiveness of customer-to-order management; and making 
our productivity and new product launch processes more competitive.DOT Objectives

The programme’s implementation can be adapted dynamically to meet the specific needs of our 
sites and offices, whose targets are linked to Company strategy and results measured year on 
year. To establish stronger ties between the functions and facilitate the spread of best practices, 
implementation is guided by two different approaches: 
 • intra-functional, enabling sustainable and incremental growth 
 • inter-functional, enabling breakthrough changes. 
At manufacturing level, the DOT holistic model focuses on specific activity areas; it guides 
our plants towards achieving operational excellence based on their needs and strategies, and 
synergistically defines action flows for each department in order to obtain sustainable results.
When assessing programme implementation and performance, the DOT evaluation system 
introduces a new way of displaying information on benchmark values and on the status of 
individual plants. Comprehensive and integrated evaluations provide continual performance 
and implementation benchmarks against other businesses both within and outside Iveco Group. 
As at 31 December 2023, 21 plants were participating in the programme, accounting for 99.7% 
of plant personnel worldwide and 100% of revenues from sales of products manufactured at 
Company plants26.
Furthermore, 2,062 DOT projects were implemented throughout the year, generating €34.6 
million in savings.

1.6.2 Economic Contribution 
Iveco Group has adopted a set of finance policies, available in the Finance Community section 
of the corporate Intranet, which cover the following main areas:
 • general accounting
 • internal controls
 • management authority and approvals
 • process accounting and management estimates
 • intercompany transactions.
Potential violations of corporate policies, the Code of Conduct, or applicable laws can be 
reported via a dedicated grievance mechanism, the Compliance Helpline.
Information on potential financial risks for Iveco Group can be found in the 2023 Annual Report 
(see Note 30). 
Our Finance function is responsible for: ensuring a global commitment to commercial excellence 
and delivering financial transparency; supporting financially sound business decisions; and 
driving our Company’s inorganic growth through corporate strategy and M&A activities. 
The function is headed by the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), who is a member of the Senior 
Leadership Team (SLT).
Iveco Group N.V . is incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, and has its corporate seat 
in Amsterdam (the Netherlands) and its principal office in Turin (Italy). 
All Iveco Group’s financial data included in this Sustainability Report is taken from the 2023 
Annual Report in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and adopted by the European 
Union (EU IFRS).
We report our operations according to our 7 business units: Truck, Bus, Powertrain, Defence 
Vehicles, ASTRA, Firefighting, and Financial Services. The activities carried out by the first 6 
business units, along with those of the corporate functions, are collectively referred to as 
‘industrial activities’.
With manufacturing, commercial, and financial services companies located in 36 countries, in 
2023 we produced 983,655 units (see 4.5.2 SASB Index  ).   
Our activities fall under two GICS ®27 sub-industries: Construction Machinery & Heavy 
Transportation Equipment, and Automobile Manufacturers (for light trucks only). For details, 
see 4.2.3.2 Skills Matrix Definitions  .

1.6.2.2 DISTRIBUTION OF VALUE ADDED
At Iveco Group, we are committed to creating value and to distributing it to our stakeholders. 
The calculation28 of value added gives us a better understanding of our economic impacts, 
enabling us to determine how much wealth we create, how it is created, and how it is 
distributed to stakeholders.
In 2023, the value added generated by our industrial activities and distributed to our various 
stakeholders totalled €3,379 million, equivalent to 20.8% of revenues.
During the year, we received €27.4 million in grants (including for research and development), 
of which 99.6% in Europe and 0.4% in the Rest of the World.

Value added by Industrial Activities 3,379
(28) The value added, representing the value generated by corporate business activities, was calculated via an internal method as the 
difference between production value and the associated intermediate costs, net of depreciation. The global net value added was then 
divided among beneficiaries as follows: employees (direct remuneration comprising salaries, wages, and severance pay; and indirect 
remuneration consisting of welfare benefits); governments (taxes distributed to governments); financial providers (interest paid on 
borrowed capital); shareholders (dividends paid); Company (share of reinvested profits); and local communities.

1.6.3 Tax Transparency
1.6.3.1 OUR APPROACH TO TAX MATTERS
Everything we do, both within and outside the Company, is according to the highest ethical 
standards as outlined in our Code of Conduct, which applies to every aspect of our business, all 
levels of our organisation, and every geographic area in which we operate. 
The same applies to how we approach tax matters. For this reason, in 2022, the Board of 
Directors of Iveco Group N.V . (hereinafter Iveco Group) – which has collective responsibility 
for the strategy of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, including all joint ventures 
in which the Company holds a controlling interest – approved the Iveco Group Tax Strategy, 
which guarantees that our tax behaviour is consistent with our ethical principles.
The Tax Strategy, publicly available on our corporate website, reflects the set of  values 
recognised as the underlying principles of Iveco Group’s tax approach, and provides the relevant 
guidelines to ensure the Company’s integrity and reputation over time, as well as consistency 
when conducting business affairs and when dealing with tax risks across our entities. 
The Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring that the purposes, principles, and guidelines 
set out in our Tax Strategy are promoted internally, and that its underlying values are applied 
and disseminated consistently. Each update of the Tax Strategy must be approved by the Board 
of Directors. The Audit Committee assists and advises the Board, and acts under authority 
delegated by the Board, with respect to the Tax Strategy thus adopted. 
Iveco Group’s principles are founded on tax sustainability, tax legality, tax transparency, and the 
pursuit of value creation for our stakeholders.

1.6.3.1.1 Our Tax Guidelines 
Iveco Group’s Tax Strategy incorporates a number of guidelines to ensure the effective 
implementation of our tax principles, steering the management of our tax affairs by establishing 
the appropriate processes to guarantee the efficacy and application of these principles. 
These guidelines provide for the following tax practices:
 • transfer pricing: Iveco Group’s cross-border intercompany transactions are regulated, for 
tax purposes, on the basis of the arm’s length principle, as outlined by the OECD30 (in the 
Model Tax Convention and in the Transfer Pricing Guidelines), with the aim of aligning, as 
fairly as possible, the transfer pricing outcomes to value creation. Iveco Group also complies 
with the provisions of OECD Guidelines on transfer pricing documentation
 • aggressive tax planning: Iveco Group does not engage in conduct and/or operations, 
whether domestic or cross-border, that result in purely artificial arrangements devoid of 
economic reality, and from which improper tax advantages can reasonably be expected 
to the extent that they are contrary to the purpose or spirit of the relevant tax provisions 
or regulations
 • low tax jurisdictions and economic substance: Iveco Group is committed to having a 
tax presence only where it carries out substantial economic activity, and therefore does not 
make artificial use of tax havens for the sole purpose of reducing the Company’s tax burden
 • tax whistleblowing: in compliance with the provisions of our Code of Conduct, Iveco Group is 
committed to fully implementing and maintaining a procedure that allows its employees and third 
parties to report alleged irregularities or suspicious conduct in tax matters
 • agree to disagree : in the interests of the Company and its stakeholders, Iveco Group 
supports – even through dispute resolution processes – interpretative positions that are 
considered sound and reasonable, even if not shared by tax authorities, including within 
the framework of cooperative compliance regimes.
(30) Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
1.6.3.2 TAX GOVERNANCE, CONTROL, AND RISK MANAGEMENT
1.6.3.2.1 Governance
Based on Iveco Group’s organisational model, our central Tax Department is responsible for:
 • modifying our Tax Strategy and adapting it to changes in our business model and to 
regulatory requirements (e.g., by proposing updates to our tax risk management system) 
 • identifying optimisation initiatives
 • monitoring key tax issues
 • providing support to other Iveco Group departments. 
The Tax functions across our jurisdictions and business units act in compliance with the 
provisions of our Tax Strategy and under the coordination of the central Tax Department, 
to ensure the correct execution of tax obligations at local level. We see to it that the Tax 
Department is adequately resourced (from a personnel, material, and financial perspective) 
and appropriately organised to perform its functions. It is responsible, among other things, for 
promoting the culture and values of tax compliance, and organises training initiatives for our 
people, including those not part of the Tax Department itself. 
1.6.3.2.2 Tax Risks and Control Management
We have committed to designing and implementing an internal control system to assist in 
the identification, evaluation, and prioritisation of tax risks, followed by a coordinated and 
balanced application of resources to minimise, monitor, and control the probability or impact of 
any adverse events. This system, the Tax Control Framework (TCF), has already been adopted 
by our main companies, and will be progressively extended throughout Iveco Group. Through 
our TCF , which is aligned with OECD Guidelines, we are able to ensure the proper execution 
of tax risk assessments, identify tax risks while verifying the controls in place at operational 
level, and see to it that the roles and responsibilities within our tax management process are 
clearly defined and assigned, with due consideration given to the principles of segregation and 
escalation of decisions. 
The TCF is part of a broader system of internal controls and corporate risk management, in which 
the various components (including the TCF) work in synergy to ensure maximum effectiveness 
and efficiency in protecting Iveco Group from business risks. This synergy is achieved through 
the efficient integration of the various control tools, and by establishing specific information 

Page 63:
We Go Beyond63 Governance Bodies Ethical Behaviour Risk and Opportunities
 Creating Prosperity
GOVERNANCE & ECONOMIC
flows between the different internal control departments, so that each can benefit from the 
results of checks carried out by the others according to their respective spheres of competence.
In accordance with applicable international best practices, Iveco Group’s TCF provides for three 
levels of control against risk . Specifically, a Tax Risk Officer is in charge of second-level 
controls and for the implementation of adequate monitoring to ensure that our internal tax risk 
control system is up-to-date and fit for the mitigation purpose for which it is designed. The Tax 
Risk Officer is a member of a unit within the Tax Department, but does not perform operational 
tax compliance activities or interpret tax regulations, as per the principle of segregation of 
duties. Meanwhile, the third-level controls are overseen by the Internal Audit Department, 
which verifies the effectiveness of the TCF and its compliance with the guidelines provided for 
by Iveco Group’s Tax Strategy.
On an annual basis, the Tax Risk Officer and the Tax Department draw up a report for the Audit 
Committee and the Board of Directors on the TCF’s operational effectiveness in ensuring that 
the Iveco Group entities that have adopted it are in control of their tax processes. The report also 
addresses how the processes in place are actually implemented, maintained, and monitored.
1.6.3.3 STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND CONCERNS OVER TAX 
MATTERS
1.6.3.3.1 Tax Authority Engagement
In accordance with the principles of our Tax Strategy, and in order to enhance our relationships 
of trust with tax authorities, Iveco Group promotes adherence to cooperative compliance 
regimes among those of its entities that are compliant with such respective local regulations. 
In this regard, in December 2023 we were admitted to the Italian cooperative compliance 
regime, with retroactive effect as of fiscal year 2022. Our aim is to gain more tax certainty 
by encouraging our entities that meet the requirements of similar regimes in their respective 
countries to gradually follow suit.
In addition to adhering to cooperative compliance regimes, Iveco Group operates with 
transparency and good faith in all its relations with tax authorities, including in the event of 
tax audits. Moreover, to avoid double taxation, the Company promotes mutual agreement 
procedures for the settlement of international disputes, directly involving the tax authorities 
from the contracting countries.
1.6.3.3.2 Creating Value for Stakeholders
Iveco Group manages its taxes in part through available incentives and provisions that allow 
for the optimisation of its tax burden. Moreover, taxes are managed in compliance with the 
principle of legality, and with the aim of safeguarding the Company’s assets while pursuing its 
main goal to create sustainable value for all stakeholders in the medium and long term.
1.6.3.4 REPORTING
From an ESG perspective, we firmly believe that taxes are a key contributor to the economies 
of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our business activities generate tax revenues for the 
governments of our countries of operation. We therefore intend to provide a timely disclosure 
of the allocation of income taxes paid for fiscal year 2023, reporting the total income taxes 
paid by Iveco Group’s companies by geographic area, including: income tax advance payments; 
income taxes related to the previous fiscal year (i.e., income tax balances related to 2022); 
taxes paid in reference to the tax assessments of previous fiscal years; and withholding taxes 
applied on cross-border payments.

1.6.4 Financial Services
GATE
The Financial Services business unit supports the growth of our industrial activities by developing 
and structuring financial products to increase product sales, profitability, and customer loyalty. 
Its strategy is to grow as a core business unit to support Iveco Group’s business proposition, at 
the same time securing the credit quality of the portfolio, adequate service levels, operational 
effectiveness, customer satisfaction, and business gain. 
In 2023, the Financial Services’ managed portfolio, including the pro-rata portfolio held by non-
consolidated joint ventures, reached approximately €8.3 billion globally. 
The portfolio’s primary products are: 
 • wholesale financing for dealers 
 • retail financing for the purchase or lease of new or used products by end-users
 • non-dealer trade receivables discounted 
 • financing programmes for industrial suppliers.
Financial Services provides support to Iveco Group on all aspects of the management of 
receivables and related risks, in line with its goal to drive best-in-class performance, leveraging 
core competencies and ensuring skills enhancement within the Company. It also oversees 
progressive process standardisation and system integration, as well as the implementation 
of shared policies, all of which drive efficiencies in terms of operations and governance. The 
selection and monitoring of business counterparts is a key element in securing the performance 
of the managed receivables. Business relationships are assessed according to sound know-
your-customer practices, anti-money laundering laws, and Company policies and procedures, 
so as to ensure that third parties’ business counterparts are reputable, qualified, and involved in 
legitimate businesses. The reference framework is regularly updated according to the evolution 
of regulations and to reflect experience gained in operations and business practices.
In 2022, Iveco Group established a new business entity – called Green 
& Advanced Transport Ecosystem (GATE) – offering the long-term, all-
inclusive rental of zero emission vehicles (ZEVs), which are destined to play a major role in 
supporting the industry’s energy transition. GATE has an independent business structure, 
and its employees are dedicated to meeting the needs of electric commercial vehicle 
customers. It started in Italy as a pilot company at the beginning of July 2023, initially 
serving Brand IVECO customers only, giving them access to the propulsion of tomorrow 
through a comprehensive service based on a pay-per-use formula. Throughout 2023 and 
2024, GATE will focus exclusively on light commercial vehicles (LCV), while concurrently 
developing an entire ecosystem for a variety of zero-emission vehicles, with applications 
ranging from last-mile delivery to long haulage. With green technology and equipment at 
its core, this ecosystem will deliver sustainable solutions to customers, leaving them free to 
determine the level of support and flexibility they require to sustain their business. Services 
will include maintenance and repairs, connectivity and telematics, insurance, energy, tyre 
management, and ancillary services.

1.6.5 Investments for 
the Planet and People
1.6.5.1 THE PLANET 
In 2023, Iveco Group’s energy expenditure was approximately €86.7 million. The Company 
invested a total of over €4.4 million in improving energy performance, generating more than 
€3.6 million in savings, and leading to a reduction in energy consumption of approximately 66 
TJ and in CO2 emissions of about 2,822 tons31. Approximately €2.9 million (about 67% of the 
total investment) was spent on the widespread replacement of existing lighting systems with 
LED technology. The remaining initiatives centred on the installation of photovoltaic systems, 
heat pumps, inverters, high-efficiency motors, intelligent stand-by systems on machinery, and 
set-point regulation adjustments according to operational requirements. For details on our

1.6.6 Value Creation Through
Innovative Solutions 
1.6.6.1 QUALITY PRODUCTS THROUGH INNOVATION
Iveco Group’s core business is the design, manufacture, and sale of trucks, commercial vehicles, 
buses, special vehicles, and powertrain applications. The ongoing research into cutting-edge 
solutions and the continuous collaboration with innovative partners enable our brands to 
manufacture products with reduced environmental impact, which not only meet customers’ 
demand for high-performance quality vehicles, but are also reliable, safe, comfortable, and 
competitive in terms of operating costs, thereby enhancing overall profitability. Our approach is 
to meet market demand by delivering products closely aligned to customer requirements, with 
a particular focus on minimising the total cost of ownership (TCO). 
Iveco Group’s Technology & Digital function is the single point of reference for new 
technologies and innovation across the Company. It manages product engineering, digital 
product capabilities, and zero-emissions vehicle programmes for each of our Truck, Bus, and 
Powertrain business units, leveraging technological innovation to accelerate the pace of product 
development and evolution. The Chief Technology & Digital Officer is also a member of our 
Senior Leadership Team (SLT).
For each business unit (BU), the Technology & Digital function: increases profitability, playing 
a leading role in evolving the Company’s business in line with the Strategic Business Plan; 
approaches the value proposition with a mindset focused on end-to-end quality and customer 
service, so as to quickly adapt and respond to customer needs; explores potential partnership 
opportunities to boost the scaling of innovation; and negotiates deals on inorganic growth 
opportunities to acquire expertise while reducing time-to-market.
Within each BU there are several product platforms, organised according to a cross-functional 
model supporting the development of new products and services with the highest quality 
standards in mind. These platforms are the epicentre of decision making for our product lines’ 
life cycles, ensuring speed, business agility, and competitiveness. Every platform is supported 
by all industrial functions, each representing different business needs, and each involved in 
the decision-making process. The product platforms act as a bridge between the industrial 
functions and the BUs. This structure ensures all-round coordination and a focus on business 
results. It also creates further benefits, such as a direct link between BU objectives and product 
plan implementation, greater customer centricity, and the broader involvement (and hence 
responsiveness) of all Company functions. By integrating the product platforms directly within 
our BUs and maintaining this cross-functional alignment, we are able to stay closer to our end 
customers’ needs and deliver our best to them. 
To better meet local customer requirements, some of our product lines are modified or entirely 
redesigned on site. To this end, we have R&D sites in Emerging Markets such as Argentina, 
Brazil, and China, actively engaged in enhancing and expanding Iveco Group’s expertise and 
technologies. The resulting wealth of information is mainly disseminated within the Company 
through web platforms and IT systems, under the responsibility of our global head of R&D. 
Furthermore, our best practices are shared and made accessible to all Iveco Group R&D staff 
worldwide via our corporate Intranet. 
As a side note regarding the above R&D sites, our Company supports the hiring of local talents, 
providing them with training as needed. To further develop our R&D capacity in these local 
markets and accelerate the transfer of knowledge, we also rely on more experienced R&D staff 
relocated from developed markets, as well as on the acquisition (be it direct or through joint 
ventures) of local product designs and knowledge. 
As part of our efforts to adopt innovative solutions, a strategic sustainability target was 
incorporated into our Strategic Business Plan:    to ensure that 100% of new products 
are developed using sustainability/recyclability design criteria by year-end 2026. This 
sustainability target was also included in our Sustainability Plan and as an individual goal in the 
Performance Development Process (PDP).
In 2023, Iveco Group’s R&D expenditure was €888 million, or 5.6% of net revenues of 
Industrial Activities of €15,877 million. R&D involved approximately 3,600 employees at 31 
sites worldwide, with approximately 260 of them located at 6 sites in Emerging Markets. At year 
end, we had a total of 6,054 active patents. As regards the specific investments in low-carbon 
opportunities, Iveco Group complies with the requirements of the EU taxonomy classification 
system, which provides a list of environmentally sustainable economic activities that support 
the EU Green Deal objectives (see 4.3.1.3 EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities  ).

1.6.6.1.1 Collaborating with External Partners
Our Company’s brands have a long tradition of delegating basic research to dedicated partners, 
such as the CRF and IMAMOTER research centres in Italy, and they rely on a number of 
successful collaborations established through the years with a broad network of universities 
across the globe. In Europe, academic partnerships include those with the following universities: 
Politecnico di Torino, Politecnico di Milano, Università degli Studi di Torino, and Università Tor 
Vergata di Roma (Italy); Univerza V Ljubljani (Slovenia); Technische Universiteit Eindhoven (the 
Netherlands); and Vrije Universiteit Brussel (Belgium). In Brazil, they include those with the 
universities Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG) and Pontifícia Universidade Católica 
de Minas Gerais  (PUC-MG). In Australia, the Company collaborates with the Swinburne 
University of Technology.
We have also always been involved in national and international workgroups, actively engaging 
in joint research projects not only with academic institutions, but also with other global entities, 
focusing on the development of new innovations while enhancing our own knowledge and skills. 
This approach has led to a number of formal partnerships, some of which centred on our 
collaboration with business partners and other third parties, others on the implementation of 
distributed creativity through crowd-sourcing, technology licensing, and/or our involvement in 
open-source initiatives:
 • Iveco Group’s collaboration with HTWO (a Hyundai Motor Group brand developing a 
hydrogen fuel cell system) to equip our future range of European hydrogen-powered buses 
with world-leading fuel cell systems
 • FPT Industrial’s agreement on the acquisition of a minority stake in Blue Energy 
Commercial Vehicles Private Ltd., a zero-emission technology company headquartered 
in Pune (India) engaged in the manufacture of clean-energy commercial vehicles under the 
brand Blue Energy Motors
 • the partnership between Brand IVECO and Plus (formerly Plus.ai), global leader in 
autonomous driving solutions for heavy-duty vehicles, to validate Plus’s technology and 
integrate it into our latest-generation IVECO S-WAY heavy-duty truck. 
1.6.6.1.2 Open Innovation
In recent years, to further strengthen our research and development efforts, we have embraced 
a much broader approach to innovation by taking on the challenge of playing an active role 
in the open innovation arena. This has involved expanding our network beyond universities to 
include new, innovative entities, and the active and successful engagement of our brands in 
open innovation, creating value for the Company and its stakeholders through collaborations 
with new, high-tech startups. These partnerships serve a dual purpose: to accelerate the 
technological evolution of our products while enhancing their sustainability, and to support 
the development of startup ecosystems in the local communities in which we operate, creating 
value and prosperity for all.
In an industry where technology is advancing rapidly and competition is fierce, we are able to 
stay one step ahead thanks to a structured scouting process (managed directly by us and/or 
with the assistance of local advisors and business accelerators), which enables us to reach out 
to a few hundred startups each year. 
To seize the best growth and collaboration opportunities available, we have devised a 
comprehensive system of tools that enable us to: participate as a venture client in the co-
development of pilot projects (as a preliminary stage to establishing actual partnerships); make 
minority investments (hence supporting the growth of startups); or execute actual mergers and 
acquisitions. 
2023 was a year full of momentous partnerships with, and investments in, innovative companies 
in different sectors and ecosystems, all sharing the same objective – to boost sustainability by 
minimising the environmental impact of products and processes. Some of these collaborations 
are described below.
 • Reefilla is an innovative Turin-based startup offering the first predictive mobile charging 
service in Italy. It has joined forces with our Brand FPT Industrial, creating a fully circular 
process that allows electric vehicle (EV) batteries to be reused once their service life has 
expired.
 • Blue Energy Commercial Vehicles  is a zero-emission technology company 
headquartered in Pune (India) focused on the decarbonisation of road transport. In 
2022, FPT Industrial made a minority investment in the company, starting a long-term 

Page 69:

GOVERNANCE & ECONOMIC
partnership that will enable the startup to expand and to benefit from our Brand’s twenty 
years of expertise in methane applications. FPT Industrial will also supply its N67 Natural 
Gas engine for the production of a new truck under the brand Blue Energy Motors, to be 
launched on the Indian market. The initial results of this partnership were seen in 2023, 
with over 400 vehicles manufactured using FPT Industrial’s natural gas engines.
 • Plus is a startup in the USA that develops autonomous driving technology for heavy-
duty vehicles leveraging AI algorithms applied to various types of sensors (video cameras, 
radars, and lidars). Our collaboration with the startup led to the launch of a pilot project 
to integrate this technology into a heavy-duty IVECO S-WAY and test it in real-life road 
traffic conditions.
 • ReLearn is an Italian startup that has designed a system using optical sensors and AI to 
monitor a company’s waste production. More specifically, the system is able to monitor 
and report on the quality of separate waste collection, providing feedback on the most 
common errors so as to spread sustainable best practices among employees. A pilot 
project to improve separate waste collection was launched in 2022 at our offices in Turin 
(Italy), involving the installation of 5 smart bins on the premises. Following its success, we 
implemented a second project in 2023 to handle most of the industrial waste generated by 
our Turin plants, so as to improve the quality of waste collection at each site.
1.6.6.2 ECO-DESIGN
One of the most challenging aspects of the design phase is determining and adopting adequate 
sustainability (i.e., eco-design) criteria to evaluate a product’s impact at each stage of its life 
cycle, from conception and component sourcing to production, use, and end of life. Because 
of this, we have established a dedicated Eco-Design working group tasked with defining 
the strategy for increasing the proportion of ecolabelled products in our portfolio, and with 
identifying new design criteria to help us achieve the strategic sustainability target included in 
our Strategic Business Plan:    to ensure that 100% of new products are developed 
using sustainability and/or recyclability design criteria by year-end 2026 . This cross-
functional group comprises members from different areas of expertise, such as technology, 
compliance, procurement, after-sale services, and sustainability. Throughout the year, the group 
explored several life cycle assessment (LCA) approaches to define a consistent and standardised 
eco-design methodology across all product platforms. The goal is to ensure that our portfolio 
features a substantial proportion of products with either an eco-label or an Environmental 
Product Declaration (EPD). Currently, only some of our products – namely, a number of FPT 
Industrial engines – are ISO 14067:2018 certified.
As we finalise the fine-tuning and incorporation of our eco-design criteria, Iveco Group 
continues to work on other fronts to reduce the environmental impact (and total cost of 
ownership) of its products. This effort includes promoting the development of more eco-friendly 
products right from the design phase, aiming at:
 • optimising fuel consumption and energy efficiency
 • reducing CO2 and other polluting emissions
 • selecting components that:
 • have a lower environmental footprint 
 • are easy to dismantle
 • can be repaired or remanufactured
 • can be recycled at product end-of-life
 • do not contain regulated substances
 • enhancing efficiency during use
 • ensuring longer intervals between maintenance cycles
 • reducing noise emissions.
Although we do not always purchase raw materials  directly (with the exception of steel 
used for direct processing), we constantly monitor their overall consumption. When designing 
components for new products (which is done in close collaboration with suppliers), priority is 
given to the use of easily recyclable materials, especially recoverable metals such as aluminium 
and cast iron, thermoplastics, and paints with low solvent content. 
When designing any new product, the estimated water usage throughout its life cycle and the 
potential reduction in customer water use are not relevant, because the product’s total water 
usage over its lifespan and the impact of product use on water quality are minimal in relation 
to overall consumption.

Iveco Group is committed to reducing or eliminating regulated substances  that pose a 
potential risk to human health and the environment from its products and its manufacturing 
operations. To this end, we collect detailed information from our supply chain on the individual 
substances contained in both parts and whole goods. It is a challenging task, given that 
collecting the necessary data requires the cooperation of the entire supply chain, which may be 
as many as ten layers deep. We are also in the process of designing out restricted substances 
and of registering products that fall within the scope of recycling laws. Additionally, the 
Company has adopted the International Material Data System (IMDS) for its entire production 
– an online platform that enables suppliers to upload detailed information on the materials and 
substances used in supply components. Under constant development and improvement, the 
IMDS underwent its latest update in May 2023, introducing a new requirement for suppliers to 
disclose the quantity of recycled plastic and biopolymers in each component, the origin of both 
materials (whether from production waste or end-of-life products), and the type of recycling 
employed (mechanical or chemical). The IMDS allows the monitoring of compliance with: the 
EU REACH34 Regulation No. 1907/2006 and POP35 Regulation No. 2019/1021 with regards to 
vehicles and components; EU RoHS36 Directive No. 2011/65 with regards to marine engines and 
generators; and Directive 2005/64/EC with regards to vehicle reuse, recycling, and recovery.
1.6.6.2.1 LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENTS 
We use life cycle assessments (LCAs) in response to the growing need to measure and reduce 
the environmental impacts of products. To date, we have performed LCA studies on several of 
our products (both vehicles and engines). Given the lack of an official regulatory framework 
of reference, we established a dedicated cross-functional working group to develop a formal, 
standardised LCA methodology based on data granularity and comparability criteria, and to 
obtain better-quality assessment results and a more systematic and structured approach to 
product ecolabelling.

2.1 Mitigating Climate Change
2.1.1 Transitioning to net zero carbon
Conscious of the urgency of climate change challenges and of the major role that 
decarbonisation will play in the short term, Iveco Group has set itself the ambitious goal of 
achieving net zero carbon by 2040 – ten years ahead of the deadline set by the Paris Agreement 
– in accordance with The Climate Pledge signed by the Company. To further address the 
potential impacts of climate change, we have also implemented major projects to improve the 
environmental performance of our manufacturing processes, logistics, and product portfolio. 
As regards the governance of our decarbonisation path, the highest responsibility for defining 
and implementing our decarbonisation strategy lies with our Board of Directors. The Board’s 
ESG Committee is responsible, among other things, for assisting the Board itself in reviewing 
and guiding this strategy, as well as the risk management policies on climate change, and for 
monitoring the implementation of measures to meet climate change targets, such as those for 
CO2 emissions and energy efficiency.
At management level, the highest responsibility for initiatives focusing on energy efficiency 
and on the management of CO 2 emissions at Iveco Group lies with the Senior Leadership 
Team (SLT). The SLT members are also members of the Sustainability Committee, which meets 
monthly and is responsible for defining sustainability strategy and for integrating sustainability 
aspects into operating processes. To ensure focus and accountability, each business unit has full 
responsibility for the global growth and performance of its respective business. The Board’s ESG 
Committee and the Sustainability Committee ensure responsible management of climate risks 
and identify trends and opportunities, including the potential impacts of new products under 
development and of new market trends and conditions.
To encourage deliberate action and commitment, and to further advance our decarbonisation 
efforts, executive compensation at Iveco Group (i.e., our long-term incentive plan) is linked, 
among other things, to the achievement of a strategic sustainability target related to Scope 
1 and 2 emissions (entailing a 50% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 compared to 2019). 
Given the all-pervasiveness of climate change issues, all competent functions (Manufacturing, 
Logistics, Purchasing, Technology & Digital, and all the business units) contribute to the 
achievement of our CO 2 emissions reduction targets according to their respective areas of 
responsibility, through specific projects and initiatives. Moreover, as further evidence of our 
ongoing commitment to managing these issues, a number of specific targets were included in 
2023’s Performance Development Process (PDP) for several of our energy and plant managers. 
As stated in our Environmental Policy1, we are committed to reducing: our impacts on natural 
heritage and biodiversity through the efficient use of energy and natural resources and by using 
the best available technologies and/or technical innovations; energy consumption through 
more efficient production processes and products; and GHG and other polluting emissions from 
production processes, not only by cutting energy consumption but also by promoting renewable 
energy sources. Our aim is to reduce the energy impact of manufacturing processes and the 
risks associated with new legislation and rising energy costs through: the implementation of our 
energy management system; ongoing employee involvement in energy resource conservation 
while raising awareness of its importance; and the realisation of technical and management 
improvement projects. The Company is also committed to minimising the environmental impact 
of its vehicles by developing products that deliver industry-leading performance in terms of fuel 
efficiency, noise and polluting emissions, and recoverability rates. 
As part of our strategy to achieve net zero carbon, we have aligned our financial planning 
with our transition plan, providing details on the relevant capital expenditure (CapEx), 
operating expenditure (OpEx), and turnover related to our economic activities that contribute 
to mitigating climate change as per the EU Taxonomy classification system (see 4.3.1.3 EU 
Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities  ).
To ensure the timely delivery of our decarbonisation strategy, we have defined specific strategic 
sustainability targets for Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. 
For Scope 1 and 2 emissions, we are committed to reducing energy consumption, air pollution 
and, above all, CO2 emissions in our manufacturing processes and to minimising the use of fossil 
fuels. We have set a strategic sustainability target for year-end 2030 for Scope 1 and 2 emissions:  
  to reduce absolute CO emissions by 50% (compared to 2019). To further drive our 
decarbonisation journey, executive compensation (i.e., our long-term incentive plan) is linked, 
among other things, to the achievement of this target. For details on our approach, investments, 
major projects realised, and interim results, see 2.1.3 GHG Emissions (Scope 1 and 2)  . 
(1) The Iveco Group Environmental Policy is available on the Company’s website.

Mitigating Climate Change
 Protecting the Environment Resource Circularity
For Scope 3 emissions, we have set a strategic sustainability target for year-end 2030 and 
incorporated it into our Strategic Business Plan:    to reduce Scope 3 CO  emissions 
by 38% from the use of sold products 2 per vehicle/km (compared to 2022). To reach 
this target, our aim is to see electric vehicles account for at least 35% of our sales by 2030 by 
gradually shifting our vehicle sales towards battery electric vehicles (BEV) and fuel cell electric 
vehicles (FCEV). For details on the implementation of our climate transition plan with regards 
to our products, see 2.1.4.1 Product Decarbonisation Strategy  .
We actively advocate for supporting measures and a consistent policy framework as key 
enablers of the energy transition in road transport. As regards policy engagement, we actively 
promote the rapid implementation of the conditions to enable the widespread adoption of zero 
emission vehicles, such as the creation of refuelling and recharging stations. We monitor and 
analyse the relevant emerging policies and regulatory developments at local and global level, 
and have established specific functions and structures within our respective business units 
and our Technology & Digital function, and developed our strategy accordingly, to ensure full 
compliance with applicable new regulations and laws. The shift in customer demand towards 
sustainable transport solutions, driven by both an increase in climate-related awareness and by 
more stringent regulations, may pose potential risks for manufacturers as this will require them 
to adapt to the evolving market. To counter this, when developing our product portfolio, we 
steer our R&D focus towards sustainable technologies (e.g., biofuels and electric and hydrogen 
propulsion technologies), so ensuring the resilience of our business model. 
(2) The target refers to vehicles manufactured in Europe.

We are committed to reducing emissions from our value chain, specifically from purchased 
goods and services and from logistics. To this end, the Company takes advantage of 
collaborations with strategic business partners, start-ups, and external experts in emerging 
technologies. We have therefore set a strategic sustainability target and incorporated it into 
our Strategic Business Plan:    a 20% reduction in absolute CO  emissions generated 
by key suppliers of purchased goods, services, and capital goods by year-end 2026 
(compared to 2022). It should be noted that this target was revised in 2023 by increasing its 
level of ambition from 20% to 30%, by expanding its scope to include major suppliers, and by 
postponing its deadline from 2026 to 2030. To achieve this target, we ensure ongoing dialogue 
and collaboration with suppliers to share experiences and to find increasingly innovative 
solutions to reduce the environmental footprint of all parties involved.
Climate risk management at Iveco Group is integrated into a Company-wide multidisciplinary risk 
management process designed to identify and assess climate-related risks and opportunities, 
as well as the current and anticipated effects of climate change that are relevant to our business 
model and value chain. The process in place allows us to identify and assess our medium to long-
term transition risks and opportunities, as well as physical risk events that could impact our sites 
and potentially lead to property damage and/or business interruptions in the short and medium-
long term (2030 and 2040). For more information on climate-related risks and opportunities, 
including the scenarios used to assess their potential business implications and to understand 
how they may evolve, see 2.1.2 Climate Risks and Opportunities Management  .

Our path to achieving our net-zero goal by 2040 is supported by our strategic sustainability targets, 
based on the climate-related risks and opportunities identified. Two of these strategic targets – to 
reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, as well as our Scope 3 emissions from the use of sold products 
(the most important category for Iveco Group) by year-end 2030 – were submitted to the SBTi3 for 
validation. However, the SBTi has temporarily suspended target validations and updates for original 
equipment manufacturers (OEM) of new on-road vehicles while a new 1.5°C-aligned pathway for 
the transport sector is being developed. We are therefore awaiting the new industry guidance to see 
whether we need to update our current target before proceeding with target validation.

Iveco Group has developed various indicators and tools to assess its contribution, exposure, 
and resilience to climate change. Annually, the Company reports its climate change impacts and 
performance in its Sustainability Report, according to the requirements of the GRI Standards. 
CO2 emissions are calculated according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, incorporated into 
Company Guidelines. For the GHG Inventory for Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, see 2.1.3.1.6 
CO2 Emissions and 2.1.4 GHG Emissions (Scope 3)  .
Every year, to ensure the credibility and transparency of our progress in implementing our 
climate transition plan, an independent third-party auditor verifies both our direct and indirect 
CO2 emissions, in accordance with the ISO 14064-3:2019 methodology for the verification and 
validation of GHG statements.

2.1.2 Climate Risks
and Opportunities Management
At Iveco Group, climate risk management is integrated into a Company-wide multidisciplinary 
risk management process designed to identify and assess climate-related risks and 
opportunities, as well as the current and anticipated effects of climate change that are relevant 
to our business model and value chain. This process encompasses our direct operations, supply 
chain (upstream), and products (downstream).
Climate-related risks and opportunities span three time horizons, meaning they can be:
 • short-term (0-4 years), as per our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and our climate 
change assessments in relation to physical and transition risks
 • medium-term (4-8 years), as per our Strategic Business Plan and our 2030 climate scenario 
 • long-term (8-18 years), as per our 2040 net zero carbon strategies and targets set to align 
with the Paris Agreement.
In order to gauge the implications of climate-related risks as well as the Company’s level 
of climate resilience and adaptability, taking the Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD) 4 as a starting point, we consider each of the following risk categories 
when identifying and assessing our risks, their likelihood and magnitude of impact, and the 
opportunities they present: 
 • current and emerging regulations
 • technology risk
 • policy and legal risks
 • market risk
 • reputation risk
 • acute physical risk
 • chronic physical risk. 
For a detailed description of the Company’s Governance, strategy, and metrics and targets 
related to climate risk, see the section on Climate-related Disclosures in the 2023 Annual 
Report.
(4) In 2023, the responsibility for monitoring the progress of companies’ climate-related disclosures was transferred from the TCFD to 
the IFRS Foundation (effective as of 2024), following the release of the new IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards. As a result, 
Iveco Group has already started to incorporate the contents of the IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures, with full alignment expected 
by 2024.

2.1.2.1 TRANSITION RISKS
Our transition risk assessment process starts with the identification of key trends and drivers 
relevant to Iveco Group and its industry. In 2023, we did this by following the TCFD guidelines 
and considering the main climate-related risk categories specified therein: Market Risk, Policy 
and Legal Risks, Technology Risk, and Reputation Risk. 
The main drivers identified to evaluate our medium to long-term transition risks and 
opportunities were: market electrification and transport behaviour; current and emerging 
climate-related regulations; developments in technology and renewable fuels; and climate-
related disclosures.
We then created a risk register to map the climate-related transition risks and opportunities 
most relevant to the Company (linking them to the aforementioned drivers), and assessed 
their relevance with a qualitative analysis – along with an in-depth quantitative analysis of a 
number of them.
Risk assessment results were then validated within our Climate Change Risk Management 
(CCRM) framework through a preliminary review by the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
function, followed by a final validation by senior management. The main outcomes were then 
incorporated into our ERM assessment. 
The medium to long-term (2030-2050) analysis of our transition risks and opportunities was 
performed using the RCP 5 1.9 scenario of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC). This scenario is based on various assumptions regarding future emissions, policies, 
and economic trends. We also adopted the NZE2050 6 scenario of the International Energy 
Agency (IEA) to perform a comprehensive analysis of the energy and automotive markets.  
Transition risks are considered significant business disruptors (potentially having a substantive 
financial or strategic impact on business) if they result in any of the following: 
 • a negative effect on one or more key strategies for the Company’s stability and growth 
 • a prolonged suspension of essential business activities
(5) Representative Concentration Pathways are a climate scenario analysis tool (with each scenario describing a potential future 
pathway). RCP 1.9 is a very ambitious scenario, being the IPCC’s lowest emission pathway towards limiting global warming to below 
1.5°C by the end of the century, which is the aspirational goal of the Paris Agreement.
(6) Net zero emissions by 2050.
 • a seizure of key assets or of profits 
 • negative repercussions on the Company’s reputation or image, resulting in: a substantial decrease 
in share price; strained relations with stakeholders; and/or a significant adverse impact on 
rankings, potentially leading to exclusion from financial and sustainability rating indices.
Based on the analysis performed, Iveco Groups’ top (most severe) transition risks are associated 
with uncertainties regarding energy costs, the life cycle of new products, and climate-related 
regulations and disclosures.
2.1.2.2 PHYSICAL RISKS
The first step in our physical risk identification and assessment process consists in evaluating 
the relevance of all such risks for each Iveco Group site within our risk perimeter, through 
the analysis of climate zones and site-specific morphological features (such as altitude and 
proximity to rivers).
We assess our physical risk exposure by taking into account specific drivers for each physical 
event (which is also relevant when selecting suitable data sources). For each physical risk driver, 
the analysis, evaluation, and selection of data tools is based on: 
 • data quality – in terms of resolution of the terrain, estimation accuracy (depending on 
the geographical scale, colour mapping, numerical precision), and the transparency of the 
calculation process
 • time flexibility – the availability of data across different time horizons and (ideally) their 
applicability to all project phases (thus enabling both short and long-term analysis)
 • accessibility – the availability of freely accessible tools with the possibility of replicating 
analyses over time
 • multiple applications – the potential of a tool to be used to assess several physical risks 
concurrently.

Page 78:

ENVIRONMENTAL
Mitigating Climate Change
 Protecting the Environment Resource Circularity
During the subsequent risk evaluation phase, these drivers are transposed onto a matrix and 
classified according to a 4-level scale (high, medium-high, medium-low, low) based on a set of 
impact thresholds specific to each physical risk event. This allows us to identify the economic 
impact of each risk event in terms of property damage (cash flow), business interruptions (EBIT), 
and other impacts or indirect costs (in addition to EBIT or cash flow). 
The net impacts of each physical risk are then quantified and recorded on the ERM impact 
scale, considering each plant’s specific characteristics and any physical mitigators (such as the 
presence of mobile dams for river flooding). The results obtained are then submitted to and 
validated by the relevant owners within Iveco Group that are associated with the selected sites.
In 2023, we performed an analysis over the medium to long term (2026-2040) of each physical 
risk event for each site within our risk perimeter, in order to evaluate any increase or decrease in 
risk exposure. We used the weather patterns of the RCP7 8.5 scenario of the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is based on various assumptions regarding emissions, 
policies, and rising temperature levels.
The main drivers considered when evaluating our medium to long-term physical risks were: data 
tool predictions of specific physical risks; changes in maximum precipitation levels; changes in 
surface wind speed; and changes in maximum temperatures.
As regards physical climate risk adaptation , the industrial risks associated with high-
frequency/high-severity natural hazards are increasingly becoming an issue for large 
manufacturing companies. 
Our Risk Management Centre of Competence analyses such hazards with the support of our loss 
prevention engineering provider and of the technical departments of the insurance and reinsurance 
companies represented on Iveco Group’s insurance panel. This analysis takes place during field 
audits and for all new project developments, using analytical techniques as well as practical, 
cost-effective methodologies delivering optimised risk-mitigation options where feasible.  
The 2023 assessment of our material physical climate risks covered 85% of the Company’s 
insured value8, with completion schedules for implementing mitigation plans typically set at 
less than 5 years. Furthermore, 100% of new projects and initiatives are analysed from the 
earliest stages of development to ensure the highest level of prevention and protection from 
material physical climate risks.
(7) Representative Concentration Pathways are a climate scenario analysis tool (with each scenario describing a potential future 
pathway). The RCP 8.5 scenario assumes a high GHG emission future without effective climate change mitigation policies.
(8) 2023’s total insured value under the control of the Loss Prevention Centre of Competence as at the third quarter of the year.
Any physical risk event that affects our direct operations is considered a significant business 
disruptor (potentially having a substantive financial or strategic impact on business) if it 
results in any of the following: 
 • significant value erosion that could lead to critical financial impacts, jeopardising the 
Company’s market leading position (high impact risk) 
 • significant value erosion that could cause significant financial issues or failure to achieve 
strategic targets (medium-high impact risk).
The aforementioned risks may cause material adverse effects in terms of business interruptions, 
property damage, or other indirect costs, thus impacting the Company’s EBIT and/or cash flow. 
It is predicted that climate change will lead to an increase in water stress and in extreme 
weather events, such as floods, hurricanes, cyclones, tornados, hailstorms, heat waves, and 
bush fires – inevitably disrupting production and component supplies. Based on the 2023 
assessment of Iveco Group sites within the risk perimeter and an initial pilot evaluation of our 
suppliers’ sites, most of our plants are located in areas that are not particularly associated with 
high-risk exposure, with the exception of a few situated in areas susceptible to hailstorms and/
or water stress. However, extreme natural events still pose a risk to the Company given the 
significant damages they can generate. 
Overall, considering the mitigation measures in place and the nature of the risks, our plants’ 
main economic vulnerability is linked to their exposure to river floods, hurricanes, cyclones, and 
tornados, whereas our suppliers’ economic exposure is mainly linked to water stress, hailstorms, 
and cold wave events. Over the year9, we invested a total of €0.29 million in loss prevention 
and mitigation measures , specifically in recommended improvements to align our sites 
to our loss prevention standards. These targeted investments cut our loss expectancies by 
approximately €88 million, resulting in a Global Efficiency Index (GEI) of 0.3310, in line with the 
highest international standards. The goal of our loss-prevention investment strategy is to reduce 
damage to assets and minimise any resulting production stoppages (business interruptions), at 
both site and Company level, through the full or partial adoption of existing physical protection 
recommendations. In 2023, Iveco Group’s loss-prevention investments cut the expected loss 
due to property damage by 13% and due to business interruptions by 87%.
(9) Figures relate to the period from 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2023 (Insurance Year), and therefore in part under our former corporate 
structure.
(10)  The Global Efficiency Index for loss mitigation measures (GEI = cost of protection/reduction of expected damage) is recognised as a 
measure of best practice for industrial risk management.

2.1.3 GHG Emissions
(Scope 1 and 2)
Iveco Group works towards climate change mitigation by reducing its energy consumption and 
by minimising the use of fossil fuels, air pollution sources and, above all, CO2 emissions in its 
manufacturing processes. Managing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and optimising energy 
consumption are prerequisites for the continuous improvement of the Company’s performance 
and the protection of the environment in which it operates.
As stated in our Energy Policy, we are committed to reducing: the use of fossil fuels in favour of 
renewable energy sources; energy consumption through more efficient products and processes; 
and GHG emissions by cutting energy consumption while adopting both conventional and 
innovative technical solutions.
The strategic sustainability targets that we have set for year-end 2030 are: 
  to reduce absolute CO emissions by 50% (compared to 2019)
  to obtain 100% of electricity consumption from renewable sources. 
It should be noted, however, that the second of these two targets was revised in 2023 and 
made more challenging by bringing forward its deadline from 2030 to 2026. 
We apply the Internal Price of Carbon  (IPoC) methodology, a strategic business tool for 
guiding investments to reduce CO 2 emissions. The IPoC allows us to classify and prioritise 
energy saving projects based on their ability to generate the greatest CO2 emissions reductions 
in relation to the investment cost sustained by the Company. The methodology also enables the 
cross-fertilisation at global level of the most effective projects in terms of CO2 reductions based 
on the specific IPoC of each geographic area and plant. 
Our activities also include the analysis of externalities, used to quantify, in monetary terms, the 
impact of a company’s processes on human health, the ecosystem, and the overall landscape, 
and hence on the environment. We assess our externalities using the ExternE 11 methodology 
developed by the International Environment Agency. This enables the tracing of each pollutant 
and/or climate-altering emission from point of emission to the affected receptors (populations, 
crops, forests, buildings, etc.) and the quantification of its impact in terms of costs. These costs 
are called externalities because, despite being generally acknowledged as real costs, they are 
normally overlooked. They are however factored in when quantifying the overall short- and 
long-term economic impact of our energy saving projects.

2.1.3.1 ENERGY MANAGEMENT AND PERFORMANCE
2.1.3.1.1 Responsibility and Organisation
At Iveco Group, we rely on a specific internal organisational structure to oversee issues related 
to the conservation of energy resources. Energy management activities are organised both 
centrally and at plant level, coordinated by the Energy function’s team and Sustainability 
Representative to ensure the necessary alignment and support from across the Company. 
The team is made up of the energy managers and specialists from each business unit and 
geographic area, interacting directly with plants and with the Sustainability Department. In 
line with the strategies defined by our Senior Leadership Team (SLT), the Energy team sets out 
our guidelines and objectives, as well as the best strategies to achieve them; it also manages 
investment budgets for specific projects and monitors the progress of our Energy Action Plan. 
The team also performs internal compliance audits and raises awareness of energy issues 
among management and employees through meetings and campaigns. An IT platform allows 
energy managers to share data reports and energy performance results. Our overall energy 
management structure consists of more than 50 professionals, located at both corporate offices 
and plants.
2.1.3.1.2 Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing Energy Management Systems
In our effort to reduce the energy impact of our manufacturing and non-manufacturing 
processes and the risks associated with new legislation and rising energy costs, we employ two 
robust energy management systems, which cover:
 • energy audits to assess energy use and consumption and to identify areas for energy 
performance improvement
 • specific, measurable, and quantifiable energy performance improvement targets to achieve 
energy savings
 • qualitative objectives associated with actions (in terms of energy behaviour) to reduce the 
amount of energy used
 • the evaluation of our progress in reducing energy consumption
 • the use of clean or green energy
 • investments in innovation and/or R&D to decrease energy consumption 
 • employee training on energy efficiency to raise awareness of reducing energy consumption.

ISO 50001 
CERTIFIED PLANTS
With regard to our manufacturing perimeter, at the end of 2023 all of our 22 plants were 
ISO 50001:2018 certified, representing 100% of our energy consumption within the 
manufacturing perimeter – evidence of our quest to reduce our energy impact 12. The main 
advantage of ISO 50001 certification is its systematic approach to continuous improvement in 
energy performance; this approach leads to a more efficient and rational use of energy, which 
translates into economic benefits and fewer greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
These efforts also applied to our non-manufacturing perimeter, governed by its own energy 
management system, resulting in our logistics hub in San Mauro Torinese (Italy) becoming 
our first ISO 50001:2018 certified non-manufacturing site. We also obtained ISO 50005:2021 
attestation (which provides for a phased approach to ISO 50001:2018 certification) for our 
dealers of property (DOPs) in Trento (Italy), Barcelona and Madrid (Spain), Vitrolles (France), and 
Hamburg, Berlin, Cologne, Mannheim, and Nuremberg (Germany).
2.1.3.1.3 Sharing and Awareness
Promoting employee involvement and awareness of the importance of energy resource 
conservation is key to achieving our improvement targets. 
In 2023, approximately 3,092 hours of training were provided (mainly by internal professionals) 
to 1,694 people across different plants. Training focused on the correct monitoring and 
management of energy performance, the Company’s decarbonisation strategy, and the best 
and latest technologies available.
We introduced several employee initiatives to enhance pro-environmental behaviour and raise 
awareness of a more sustainable lifestyle. For example, energy workshops were organised 
during the year, covering a range of topics of interest to our many energy specialists attending 
from plants worldwide. Two initiatives in particular caught their attention: a remote event on 
high-efficiency electric motors, and Energy Days, held in October at the FPT Industrial plant 
in Foggia (Italy). The latter brought together energy specialists, experts, and enthusiasts from 
different companies and institutions to discuss ideas and best practices on the theme of 
‘Exploring New Frontiers of Sustainable Energy’. 
(12)  For the complete list of plants, see 4.2.1.2 Data Coverage .
Energy efficiency was a key topic of the event, recognised as both a priority and an opportunity 
for companies to reduce operating costs and mitigate climate change. 
These are but a few examples of how sustainability matters have become embedded in our 
daily activities and how they help drive our way of doing business.
2.1.3.1.4 Energy Performance
An efficient energy management system requires effective monitoring of energy performance. 
We have achieved this by adopting specific energy performance indicators (EnPI) to measure 
the benefits and effectiveness of our initiatives, plan improvement measures, and establish new 
and ever-more challenging targets. 
In 2023, we monitored energy performance at each of our plants, as well as their secondary 
vectors and their compliance with our Energy Action Plan, using our Energy Monitoring & 
Targeting (EMT) management and control platform. Additionally, we enhanced the exchange 
and dialogue between plants by means of an Intranet portal focusing on procedures, best 
practices, regulations, corporate Guidelines, and solutions to energy-related issues and 
challenges. The initiative led not only to an increased level of people engagement and 
awareness, but also to numerous technical and management improvement projects involving 
the redesign of processes, equipment conversions and retrofitting for decarbonisation, and 
operational changes to new installations.

In 2023, we invested over €4.4 million in efficiency projects, generating more than €3.6 million 
in savings. The simple payback period is estimated at 1.2 years. The projects led to a reduction 
in energy consumption of approximately 66 TJ and a reduction in CO2 emissions of about 2,822 
tons (as per the market-based method).
Approximately €2.9 million (about 67% of the total investment) was spent on the widespread 
replacement of existing lighting systems with LED technology. The remaining initiatives centred 
on the installation of photovoltaic systems, heat pumps, inverters, high-efficiency motors, 
intelligent stand-by systems on machinery, and set-point regulation adjustments according to 
operational requirements.
A further significant initiative involved heat generation and distribution systems, with 
approximately €1.1 million (about 24% of the total investment) spent on: replacing low-
efficiency burners with new high-efficiency, low-emissions technology; installing solar collectors 
for the production of sanitary hot water; and sectioning distribution networks.

2.1.3.1.6 CO2 Emissions
We calculated our CO2 emissions according to the GHG Protocol standards incorporated into 
Company Guidelines. Our only sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, besides those 
deriving from energy consumption, are associated with the use of hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) 
compounds with global warming potential (GWP). These are present in equipment for air-
conditioning, cooling, fire suppression, and manufacturing. The potential emissions from these 
substances (CO2e) are negligible compared with emissions from energy production: in fact, with 
an incidence of 1.3%, they fall outside the reporting scope15.
(15)  Details on the reporting scope are available in 4.2.1.2 Data Coverage .
In 2023, our CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2)16 were 88,683 tons17, a 4.4% decrease compared 
to the previous year. This was due to a fall in natural gas consumption. As regards CO2 emissions 
performance, measured as our total CO2 emissions divided by hours of production, our 2023 
year-end results improved, with the key performance indicator (KPI) falling by approximately 
8.9% compared to the previous year.

NEW NET ZERO BUS PLANT 
IVECO BUS, our urban, intercity, and tourism bus brand, opened a new 
plant in Foggia (Italy) entirely devoted to the production of zero- and 
low-emission buses. The plant generates net zero CO2 emissions as 100% of its energy 
comes from renewable sources, which include over 1,000 photovoltaic panels producing 
640 MWh per year. Additionally, it has a strong focus on recycling and on reducing energy 
consumption by making use of high-performance construction materials, intelligent LED 
lighting, and harvested rainwater. The investment in the new plant has been partially 
offset by funds from Italy’s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR), and two of the 
latter’s pillars have already been adopted: ‘Green Revolution and Ecological Transition’ and 
‘Infrastructure for Sustainable Mobility’.

2.1.4 GHG Emissions (Scope 3) 
The only way to truly accomplish our transition to net zero carbon is by giving due consideration 
to Scope 3 emissions. To this end, we monitor each of the 15 categories of Scope 3 emissions 
defined by the GHG Protocol18, but our main focus is on our products, logistics, and suppliers. 
As also evidenced by the many life cycle assessments (LCAs) performed on our products, Scope 3 
category 11 – emissions from the use of sold products – has the greatest impact at Iveco Group. 
We have therefore set a CO2 emissions reduction target for this category, based on our Strategic 
Business Plan forecasts for product types and volumes, along with analogous targets for our 
logistics processes and supply chain. 
We have submitted the aforementioned Scope 3 target, as well as a reduction target regarding 
our absolute CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2), to the SBTi19 for validation. However, the SBTi has 
temporarily suspended target validations and updates for original equipment manufacturers 
(OEM) of new on-road vehicles while a new 1.5°C-aligned pathway for the transport sector is 
being developed. We are therefore awaiting the new industry guidance to see whether we need 
to update our current target before proceeding with target validation.

2.1.4.1 PRODUCT DECARBONISATION STRATEGY 
Iveco Group has a highly diversified product portfolio, from IVECO commercial goods vehicles 
to IVECO BUS and HEULIEZ passenger buses, ASTRA off-road trucks, and MAGIRUS firefighting 
vehicles. They each offer a very different range of features to perform the very different tasks 
they were designed for. Adding to this broad product mix is FPT Industrial, which manufactures 
industrial powertrains for trucks, buses, agricultural and construction equipment, boats, and 
power generators. Of course, this diversified offering played a major role in shaping our 
decarbonisation strategy, requiring the technology-neutral approach that we have been 
pursuing for many years now. This approach currently includes propulsion systems ranging from 
traditional technologies to natural gas (NG), biofuels, battery-electric, and hydrogen.
In line with our goal of achieving net zero carbon by 2040, we have set a vehicle CO2 emissions 
reduction target to be achieved by year-end 2030:   a 38% reduction in Scope 3   
CO  emissions from the use of sold products 20 per vehicle/km (compared to 2022). To 
reach this target, we are gradually shifting our vehicle sales towards battery electric vehicles 
(BEV) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV), with the ambition to see electric vehicles account for 
at least 35% of our sales by 2030.
Meanwhile, even though we believe that the majority of vehicles sold in the future will be 
electric, we still foresee a potential market for internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles running 
on sustainable biofuels or other fossil-free fuels, including hydrogen. We also know that, on our 
journey towards decarbonised transport, there will be legislative milestones for CO2 emissions 
globally. For all these reasons, we are continuing to invest in ICEs and after-treatment systems 
to increase fuel efficiency, meet legislative requirements, and remain competitive.
2.1.4.1.1 Internal Combustion Engines
The brand new XC13 engine, to be installed in the new IVECO S-WAY Model Year 2024 launched 
in Barcelona (Spain) in November 2023, is FPT Industrial’s first multifuel, single base engine – an 
example of its Cursor X’s power source concept, which is multi-power, modular, multi-application, and 
mindful (i.e., intelligent). For maximum component standardisation and simple vehicle integration, 
the base engine comes in multiple versions: diesel, natural gas (NG, including biomethane) and, 
currently under development, hydrogen. Besides delivering world-class performance, the new XC13 
engine has the potential to be a primary driver in achieving short- and medium-term CO2 emissions 
(20)  Target refers to vehicles manufactured in Europe.
2   
targets. Indeed, a truck fitted with an XC13 engine generates 9% fewer CO2 emissions (a reduction 
of 9 tons per year) compared to the same truck fitted with a C13 engine (Model Year 2022). The new 
XC13 engine, unveiled for off-road applications at AGRITECHNICA 2023 in Hanover (Germany), will 
help to deliver future CO2 reductions in agricultural and construction applications as well, making it 
a major player in our decarbonisation strategy. 
FPT Industrial’s research is currently focusing on second-generation renewable biofuels, in 
accordance with EN 15940 fuel specifications, and specifically on hydrotreated vegetable oil 
(HVO), also known as green diesel (or XTL). Since 2020, all of the Brand’s engine families have 
been type-approved in this regard, and a number of our buses and coaches have already been 
adapted to run on HVO to reduce their CO 2 emissions. HVO and XTL fuels in general are an 
effective way to tackle the CO 2 emissions of existing fleets, as they are fully compatible with 
current engine technologies and distribution infrastructure. Furthermore, we are seeing an 
increasing number of fuelling stations across Europe distributing HVO as a neat fuel (i.e., not 
mixed or diluted with other fuels). In this regard, Iveco Group signed a letter of intent with 
energy company Eni, which now sells HVOlution (its first diesel fuel produced from 100% 
renewable raw materials) at over 600 fuelling stations in Western Europe. The goal of this 
collaboration is to support the smooth transition from fossil to renewable fuels. 
In 2023, FPT Industrial’s Tector 6.7 engine, which powers the Crossway intercity coach 
produced by our Brand IVECO BUS, was  homologated  for biodiesel B100, thus meeting 
the requirements of EN14214, the European standard for biodiesel. This new version of the 
Crossway is especially well-suited to address the decarbonisation needs of school and urban 
transport, given the biodiesel’s ability to cut CO2 emissions by almost 60% across the well-to 
-wheel cycle compared to traditional diesel.
For internal combustion engines (ICEs), biomethane remains one of the best alternatives 
to diesel in the medium term. All our currently available NG engines are 100% biomethane-
compatible, the many benefits of which include:
 • full compatibility with existing NG technology
 • renewably sourced fuel
 • near zero well-to-wheel CO2 emissions – or even negative emissions (up to 130% fewer 
compared to diesel) if sourced from manure
 • alignment to a circular economy approach.

 Protecting the Environment Resource Circularity
With over 95,000 units sold to date, FPT Industrial has the largest NG engine portfolio on the 
market and is a leader in NG engine sales in Europe. Furthermore, its N67 NG is the only medium-
duty NG engine on the European market. In 2023, this engine was launched on the new IVECO 
Eurocargo truck, delivering up to 10% fewer CO2 emissions compared to the diesel version. It was 
also installed on the GWAY , the new gas midibus (effectively replacing the previous diesel version), 
as part of Iveco Group’s portfolio transition to low-carbon transport solutions. This mid-size NG city 
bus is destined to become a best-seller in the European Union as it provides a sustainable mobility 
solution for narrow streets, mountainous regions, and/or areas of low population density. The N67 
NG will soon also power New Holland’s LNG tractor concept.
Among the existing technologies suitable for NG engine development, the Brand is currently focusing 
on multipoint stoichiometric combustion, the only cost-effective solution to bring emissions in line 
with Euro VI standards. Indeed, thanks to the closed-loop control of the lambda sensor and the 
use of a 3-way catalyst and CNG particulate filter, NG engines can reduce harmful emissions (e.g., 
hydrocarbons and NOX) to very low levels. They are used in commercial vehicles, buses, special 
vehicles, and agricultural equipment, and are available in the Cursor, NEF , and F1 engine series, 
offering customers significant cost benefits throughout the entire service life of vehicles. 
The use of hydrogen as a fuel for ICEs to achieve zero-carbon emissions does not require 
major modifications to current vehicle architectures (whether on- or off-road), and avoids the 
need for an electric motor to provide power assist. FPT Industrial is currently developing its 
H2-ICE technology, designing a new series of engines offering modular, multifuel solutions 
that are simple to install. In this regard, the new XC13 multifuel engine was presented at 
AGRITECHNICA 2023 in its direct hydrogen injection version, and is undergoing trials on 
PRINOTH’s snow groomer prototype.
BIOETHANOL IN BRAZIL 
Bioethanol, widely used for some time in Brazil, is a renewable biofuel 
derived from the fermentation of biomass (mainly waste from sugarcane 
processing) that has the potential to reduce CO2 emissions by 88% throughout the entire 
well-to-wheel cycle compared to diesel equivalents. Biofuels are widespread in Brazil´s 
transport sector, with most passenger cars being flex-fuel vehicles (constituting 91% of 
sales in 2022) able to run on both petrol and ethanol. Moreover, there is a mandatory 
requirement in the country that petrol must contain 27% ethanol. 
Given the broad availability of sugarcane bioethanol, our brand FPT Industrial has 
been testing dual-fuel engines that run on blends of up to 40% bioethanol, as well as 
engines that run on 100% ethanol. Tests were run nationwide on machine and vehicle 
prototypes, both in agricultural and on-road applications, yielding positive results in terms 
of performance and fuel consumption. Between 2021 and 2022, in partnership with the 
Federal University of Itajubá (UNIFEI, in the state of Minas Gerais), FPT Industrial began tests 
on its N67 dual-fuel engine using farnesane (diesel from sugarcane) and either ethanol, 
green hydrogen, or biomethane as a possible fuel for tractors. 
Then, in 2023, it partnered once again with UNIFEI and with German automotive parts 
manufacturer MAHLE to start simulations and testing on its F1C 3.0L Bi-Fuel engine 
running on 100% ethanol or biomethane, as a possible solution for light commercial 
vehicles or serial hybrid buses.

2.1.4.1.2 e-Mobility
Our Brand FPT Industrial has an ePowertrain Team within its Powertrain Product Engineering 
Department that works exclusively on the development of electric vehicle technologies. The 
Brand’s goal is to meet customer needs with a wide range of tailor-made alternative propulsion 
solutions for every type of mission, thus strengthening its positioning in the market as a 
multipower solutions provider. To date, FPT Industrial’s portfolio includes:
 • battery and fuel-cell electric solutions 
 • eDrivelines (eAxles, central drives, and electric drive units)
 • energy storage systems (battery packs)
 • hybrid vehicle solutions (electric assist systems).
In October 2022, FPT Industrial opened its new ePowertrain plant, in Turin (Italy), entirely 
devoted to the production of the Brand’s electric range – i.e., the manufacture of electric 
drivelines as well as the assembly of battery packs. 
As regards ePropulsion, the Brand offers 3 solutions: eAxles, central drives, and electric drive 
units (EDU). 
The eAxle is a compact and flexible solution that transfers power and torque to the wheels 
through the gearbox. It can support 3 vehicle layouts – front, rear, and all-wheel – and 
can be used for different vehicle categories, including light and heavy commercial vehicles. 
Furthermore, thanks to its compact design, the eAxle can be installed in vehicles where space 
is very limited, making it the most efficient of the ePropulsion systems.
The central drive, on the other hand, entails the addition of an electric power unit to the 
traditional propulsion system (a thermal engine), but can nevertheless be installed on existing 
vehicles with minimal impact while maintaining the existing architecture. It is scalable to suit 
different modes, enabling the vehicle to run on all types of propulsion – electric, hybrid, and 
internal combustion. The central drive is the ideal solution for various applications, such as electric 
last-mile intercity missions and full-hybrid long-haul applications. eAxles are suitable for heavy-
duty vehicles such as the IVECO S-eWAY truck, while electric central drives are best for light 
commercial vehicles and minibuses like the IVECO eDaily.
The electric drive unit (EDU) is an independent suspension solution with integrated eMotor 
and inverters that is suitable for passenger cars. FPT Industrial EDUs have been fitted onto the 
Maserati Gran Turismo Folgore: the first is a 300 kW solution on the front axle and the second 
a 600 kW twin motor on the rear axle, both equipped with torque vectoring and a park lock 
system to enhance stability and safety. 
As regards energy storage systems, FPT Industrial offers 3 different battery pack solutions: 
a 37 kWh solution for the IVECO eDaily and for minibuses; a 69 kWh solution for the IVECO 
BUS range; and a 42 kWh solution for off-road vehicles. The complete battery lineup is modular 
(more than one pack can be mounted in parallel). Moreover, NMC pouch cell technology 
allows the battery packs’ energy density to be maximised, ensuring high levels of safety. The 
Brand’s eBS 37 EVO battery is already compliant with the ECE Regulation 100 Rev.3 on electric 
vehicle safety. This battery pack can be reused (and thus its lifespan extended) thanks to the 
Brand’s proprietary battery management system (BMS), while its end-of-life is managed using 
a 4R approach – repair, reconditioning, reuse, and recycle. As per several agreements in place 
with recycling companies in Europe, battery pack recycling is carried out in compliance with 
applicable laws. Meanwhile, the Company is exploring a number of options for battery pack 
reuse once they have been removed from vehicles at the end of their service life, including a 
pilot project launched with Reefilla aimed at reusing FPT Industrial’s eBS 37 electric batteries. 
The new IVECO eDaily – the first-generation, full-electric version of our best-selling IVECO Daily 
commercial van – offers customers a full ecosystem of eMobility services, including a comprehensive 
selection of charging solutions delivered in collaboration with strategic energy partners. Other services 
include the innovative eDaily Routing and IVECO ON Easy Daily apps. The former communicates with 
the vehicle to predict vehicle range, required battery charge to reach a given destination, and precise 
time of arrival. The latter, which can be integrated with the IVECO Driver Pal voice assistant, offers 
vehicle-specific information on performance (health checks, battery levels, etc.), remote scheduling 
of battery recharge and preconditioning, navigation to recharging stations, and more.
IVECO BUS launched its new array of electric models, extending its range of zero-emission 
vehicles and minibuses to meet the demands of urban, peri-urban, and suburban missions: 
 • the CROSSWAY LE ELEC: a new full-electric bus to support sustainable suburban and peri-
urban mobility projects
 • the STREETWAY ELEC: a 12-metre, battery-electric city bus designed to meet the specific 
needs of European and extra-European markets

than 56 million kilometres across 12 European countries 
 • the eDAILY: the latest addition to the DAILY minibus family; this new 100% electric minibus 
is also available in chassis version.
E-BENCH. A NEW AND UNIQUE  
TESTING FACILITY IN EUROPE
In 2023, IVECO BUS officially inaugurated its new testing and validation 
facility called E-BENCH, located at our R&D site in Vénissieux (France), 
the global headquarters of Iveco Group’s bus and coach operations. 
Unique in Europe, this innovative and extremely versatile facility allows the testing of both 
individual components and complete vehicles in simulated driving conditions, including all 
types of missions and climates. E-BENCH boasts extensive testing capabilities, featuring a 
roller dynamometer, a climate bench, a bench for individual components, and a complete 
HIL (hardware-in-the-loop) bench for simultaneously testing all components. Furthermore, 
it has the flexibility to accommodate electric and hydrogen propulsion vehicles. E-BENCH 
comprises interconnected cells for vehicle testing and, most importantly, functional 
models known as SKATE. The main test cell can simulate vehicle dynamics via two loading 
machines while replicating extreme climate conditions and integrating climate functions 
across all seasons, with a temperature range of -15°C to +55°C. This setup allows us to 
thoroughly test vehicle functionality without the actual vehicle, resulting in significant 
advancements in time to market, reliability, and the evolution of the Brand’s eMobility 
solutions.
2.1.4.1.3 Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles
One of the solutions in moving closer to decarbonisation is the use of fuel cell electric vehicles 
(FCEVs), which are particularly suitable for long-haul transport and, in general, for applications 
requiring a trade-off between longer range, higher payload, and lower refuelling time. This applies 
to heavy-duty vehicles, light-duty commercial vehicles, and urban transport vehicles alike.
Brand IVECO’s BE THE CHANGE launch event in Barcelona (Spain) saw the unveiling of the 
IVECO S-eWAY , a heavy-duty electric truck for the European market with a range of up to 800 
kilometres, fitted with Bosch fuel cells and an FPT Industrial eAxle. This first-generation vehicle 
is competing favourably in the toughest heavy-duty missions against very well-established 
fossil diesel engines, despite the latter having powered many generations of vehicles over the 
course of more than a century. 
Within the light-duty range, IVECO and Hyundai unveiled a working prototype of the eDaily 
FCEV , featuring Hyundai’s 90 kW hydrogen fuel cell system and 140 kW e-motor, and a battery 
pack designed by FPT Industrial. The prototype has a 7.2-ton gross vehicle weight (GVW). It 
has been tested in Europe, confirming a range of 350 kilometres, a 3-ton maximum payload, 
and a refuelling time of 15 minutes or less. While the eDaily BEV version is designed for short 
journeys, the eDaily FCEV will be ideal for longer, high-payload missions.
In 2023, IVECO BUS  launched the IVECO BUS E-WAY , fitted with Hyundai 90 kW fuel cells 
and FPT Industrial batteries. In 2023, it brought its zero-emission range to the city with the 
launch of the new E-WAY H2, a fuel cell urban bus. The E-WAY H2 is a 12-metre, low-floor 
bus that can accommodate up to 110 passengers, giving IVECO BUS customers the option 
to choose between two or three access doors. It is fitted with Hyundai’s advanced fuel cell 
system, installed in the rear compartment and powered by 4 hydrogen tanks on the roof. This 
is in addition to a 290 kW SIEMENS ELFA 3 electric engine and an FPT Industrial NMC 69 
kWh battery pack, thanks to which the vehicle consumes less hydrogen and achieves a range 
of up to 450 kilometres (under normal driving conditions). To optimise hydrogen distribution 
and maximise efficiency, on board the E-WAY H2 is our new electric Vehicle Control Platform 
(eVeCoP) software, developed in-house.

2.1.4.1.4 Low-Carbon Products
On the path to decarbonisation, our Company’s brands are committed to adopting clean energy 
solutions and minimising emissions by developing a full range of more efficient, low-emission 
products.
We classify products as low carbon based on the EU Taxonomy for environmentally sustainable 
economic activities (see 4.3.1.3 EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities  ). Total avoided 
emissions are estimated using an internal methodology that considers the number of vehicles 
sold in 2023, the average CO 2 emissions across the entire range, and the average annual 
mileage for each category.

2.1.4.2 LOGISTICS PROCESSES
In managing our logistics processes, we continuously seek sustainable solutions to help 
fight climate change, preserve natural resources, and safeguard health. For this purpose, our 
logistics processes are managed both internally within the value chain, specifically within the 
Manufacturing, Sales, and Procurement functions, and externally, by working with our partners 
to optimise the efficiency of logistics flows to reduce their environmental impact. Sustainable 
logistics bring time and cost efficiencies, emissions reductions, and improved resource utilisation 
and packaging management; they also mitigate indirect impacts on traffic congestion and 
human health. 
As stated in our Environmental Policy, Iveco Group’s approach to low-carbon logistics focuses 
on 3 areas:
Logistics Areas
increasing low-emission transport, adopting intermodal solutions, and optimising transport saturation.
Our Senior Leadership Team (SLT) has the highest responsibility for initiatives aimed at reducing 
the environmental impact of our logistics processes. We have designed our logistics system to 
deliver safety, ergonomics, reduced emissions, and uninterrupted transport logistics flows. This 
approach ensures the effective management and evaluation of logistics projects in line with 
defined standards. Moreover, since the active engagement of our suppliers is integral to the 
efficiency and sustainability of our logistics system, we directly involve them in most of our 
projects and initiatives, working with them to develop and implement the best solutions to 
meet our environmental impact reduction targets. As evidence of our commitment to reducing 
our logistics impacts, we have incorporated a strategic sustainability target into our Strategic 
Business Plan: a    7% reduction in kilos of CO  emissions per ton of goods shipped 
(inbound, outbound, and spare parts) by year-end 2026 (compared to 2022). 
In addition, individual targets were included in the Performance Development Process (PDP) for 
several managers responsible for the main projects involved in reaching the aforementioned target.
Throughout the year, our Transport Logistics Team had to deal with various issues, such as a 
significant increase in urgent shipments by air (mainly from Brazil and China to South America 
and Europe) due to a component shortage among our strategic suppliers. However, an increase in 
vehicle shipments in the second half of the year depleted levels of stock and of vehicles awaiting 
completion, which had been responsible for an increase in CO2 emissions in early 2023.
Despite the challenges, we continue to put initiatives in place to advance sustainable logistics 
processes without compromising service quality or profitability, with a focus on generating 
positive social impacts. Our aim is to reduce the environmental impact of our logistics operations 
by focusing on technologies, procedures, and activities to optimise our use of transport modes, 
intermodal flows, and long-haul transport. 
In 2023, as part of our digitalisation agenda, we launched the Sustainability Tool, a major 
initiative focused on reducing our CO2 emissions. It not only streamlines the calculation of CO2 
emissions from logistics, but also represents a vital opportunity for change management. The 
tool is designed to:
 • automate and standardise the data collection process 
 • increase the frequency of data monitoring
 • perform strategic network-level simulations to cut CO2 emissions.

ENVIRONMENTAL
Mitigating Climate Change
 Protecting the Environment Resource Circularity
We promote the use of road vehicles compliant with the most stringent environmental standards: 
in Europe, for example, specific contractual clauses oblige external transport providers to use 
vehicles compliant with Euro IV standards or higher. Optimising transport capacity is also key 
to limiting costs and environmental impact, which is why we make technical and organisational 
changes to both routes and volumes to optimise and streamline the entire process.
IVECO CONTAINERS 
MANAGEMENT
In 2023, we launched Iveco Containers Management (ICM), a project 
aimed at monitoring the handling of shipping containers and at 
boosting their reuse. To achieve these objectives, we took over our transport service 
provider’s operations, purchasing its returnable plastic and metal containers. These are 
used within our inbound logistics to supply materials to our plants, and are then returned 
to the suppliers to be reused for subsequent deliveries, contributing to a virtuous cycle.
By using returnable containers, we are able to:
 • reduce our consumption of disposable packaging (mainly cardboard and wood), 
thereby cutting costs and waste
 • optimise transport loads
 • increase the capacity and efficiency of packaging and transport 
 • enhance load safety during transport
 • improve the handling of goods and safe warehouse storage
 • use fewer resources and generate fewer CO 2 emissions, benefitting the 
environment.
During its first year, the project handled more than 290,000 returnable containers of 
different types and involved 5 plants in Italy (Brescia, Suzzara, Torino Motori, Torino 
Driveline, and Foggia), 2 in Spain (Madrid and Valladolid), and 130 suppliers. Having 
shown itself to be an effective and sustainable choice, our plan is to expand the ICM 
perimeter in the coming years by investing in more returnable containers and in 
additional logistics flows.
2.1.4.2.1 Monitoring Environmental Performance
In order to substantiate the strategic sustainability target we have set for logistics and the 
relevant improvement projects, we duly monitor some of the environmental aspects considered 
most significant21 for logistics processes. CO2 emissions are affected by:
 • the number of inbound/outbound transport flows
 • our effectiveness at promoting mitigation initiatives among suppliers (e.g., through specific 
contractual clauses)
 • emissions reduction initiatives (e.g., the adoption of intermodal solutions and containment 
of air shipments).
By year-end 2023, the containment initiatives in place had already allowed us to cut CO 2 
emissions by 1.4% compared to the previous year (in terms of kilos of CO 2 emissions per ton 
of goods shipped).

2.1.4.3 SUPPLY CHAIN ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT
Iveco Group suppliers are actively involved in our mission to reduce the environmental impact 
of our activities and fight climate change, in line with our commitments. In fact, to further limit 
the impact of manufacturing processes and products on the environment, our Supplier Code of 
Conduct expressly requires them to optimise their use of resources and minimise polluting and 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It also encourages them to effectively manage waste treatment 
and disposal, and to adopt logistics management processes that limit environmental impact.
(21)  The criteria used to measure the significance of the environmental aspects of logistics processes are the size of their impact as well 
as the Company’s ability to manage and mitigate both the impact and its potential effects on the surrounding environment.

ENVIRONMENTAL
Mitigating Climate Change
 Protecting the Environment Resource Circularity
For these reasons, our suppliers are strongly advised to adopt an environmental management 
system certified according to international standards.
During 2023, we continued to monitor and interact with our supplier network through Open-es, 
the community-based digital platform that we joined in 2022, so as to increase our suppliers’ 
engagement with and awareness of sustainability topics while tracking their sustainability 
performance (see 3.3.3.3 Supplier ESG Assessment  ). We use the Open-es platform to monitor 
environmental aspects in line with the guidelines of the World Economic Forum related to the 
policies, activities, and results concerning:
 • climate change
 • energy efficiency
 • biodiversity
 • water resources
 • circular economy
 • plastic recycling.
The suppliers that registered on the platform in 2023 represent approximately 82% of our 
direct material purchases. The platform is a valuable tool that we use both to communicate 
our priorities and to support suppliers on their path towards sustainability. This interactive 
ecosystem, combined with our ongoing dialogue and collaboration with suppliers, is a means 
to share experiences and find increasingly innovative solutions to reduce the environmental 
footprint of both parties. As part of our assessment of Scope 3 emissions categories, we monitor 
category 1 emissions (from purchased goods and services) and category 2 emissions (from 
capital goods). A strategic sustainability target for the environment was incorporated into our 
Strategic Business Plan:    a 20% reduction in absolute CO  emissions generated 
by key suppliers of purchased goods, services, and capital goods by year-end 2026 
(compared to 2022). It should be noted that this target was revised in 2023 by increasing its 
level of ambition from 20% to 30%, by expanding its scope to include major suppliers, and by 
postponing its deadline from 2026 to 2030.

2.1.4.4 COMMUTING
In our effort to reduce the environmental footprint of employee commuting, we promote 
sustainable mobility by encouraging our people to make use of the full range of available 
transport options, and by subsidising eco-friendly mobility solutions. This approach yields many 
additional benefits that go beyond the reduction of our environmental impact: it enhances our 
people’s wellbeing by reducing commute times, costs, stress, and the risk of accidents, and 
provides opportunities for employees to socialise. 
Iveco Group has implemented several initiatives for sustainable mobility at a number of its 
plants and offices worldwide, collaborating and exploiting all available synergies with its 
neighbouring plants. These projects are designed in collaboration with both local authorities 
and public transport companies.
In Italy, we revised a number of mobility plans for selected sites, at the same time conducting 
an analysis and assessment of employee commuting to/from such locations. The study focused 
on available transport services, methods, and infrastructure, as well as on the CO 2 emissions 
generated by employee commutes, with the aim of identifying further improvement measures 
and initiatives. In 2023, employee commuting in Italy generated 11,271 tons of CO2 emissions. 
At our sites in Brescia, Bolzano, Foggia, Piacenza, San Mauro, Suzzara, Turin, and Vittorio 
Veneto (Italy) we relaunched our carpooling drive via the UP2GO app (following its suspension 
due to the COVID pandemic).
We also offered various prizes as an incentive to encourage employees to commute to work using 
car sharing or alternative transport, such as electric/non-electric bikes and electric scooters. 
At the plant in Vysoke Myto (Czech Republic), employees were able to use the JOBka mobile 
app to carpool when commuting to/from the site. Furthermore, various public train and bus 
services were launched or upgraded, in line with our commitment to encourage our employees 
to use public transport and so reduce CO2 emissions.
In Brazil, France, and Spain, the Company provides shuttle services for employees commuting 
between their workplaces and nearby strategic points. Both the Turin site and the San Mauro 
Torinese logistics hub (Italy) are served by MyShuttle!, an innovative on-demand shuttle service 
that uses IVECO natural gas-powered minibuses. The service can be booked in advance or last

minute, depending on employees’ work needs, using a specially designed proprietary app that 
we developed with VIA Technologies. 
In Germany, the Company partially subsidised costs for 150 employees who used public 
transport on their commutes. 
During the year, we also organised many bike events. At the plant in Vysoke Myto (Czech 
Republic), in May, the initiative Do práce ak ole  (To Work by Bike) saw the participation of 
96 employees, so avoiding 35 tonnes of CO 2 emissions. Prizes were awarded to the greenest 
commuters. In June, the sites in Annonay and Venissieux (France) joined the Mobility Challenge 
initiative, during which they promoted environmentally friendly transport and car sharing as 
well as the use of protective equipment to ensure safety when travelling by bike or scooter.
A further opportunity to reduce the environmental impact of employee commuting is provided 
by the flexible working schemes (see 3.2.7.1.2 Flexible Working  ) that Iveco Group has 
adopted in several of its countries of operation.
2.1.4.5 BUSINESS TRAVEL
At Iveco Group, we continuously monitor the CO 2 emissions associated with our employees’ 
business travel by air, mindful of its environmental impact. In 2023, employee air travel 
managed directly by Company headquarters22 (75% of which was medium haul23) generated 
3,458 tons of CO2 emissions for 11,029 business trips. This figure was calculated according to 
the GHG Protocol by Atmosfair, a climate protection organisation focused on the environmental 
impact of travel. 
Because CO2 is an inevitable by-product of fuel combustion in aircraft24, emissions are undoubtedly 
the most significant environmental impact of air travel. In many instances, however, this mode of 
travel is unavoidable due to the broad geographical distribution of our sites. 
We are able to optimise our business travel and contain our environmental impact by using 
online communication tools to enable employees across the globe to interact effectively. 
Additionally, we leverage advanced online audio/video conferencing and other virtual tools 
that allow our people to work remotely from their offices rather than travel long distances, 
which contributes to reducing emissions and costs. 
(22)  Data refers to Belgium, China, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the UK.
(23)  Medium-haul transfers are those from 500 to 1,600 kilometres.
(24)  According to the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), aircraft emit gases and particles directly into the upper 
troposphere and lower stratosphere, where they: alter atmospheric composition, particularly of greenhouse gases (GHG), including 
carbon dioxide (CO2), ozone (O3), and methane (CH4); trigger the formation of condensation trails; and increase cirrus cloudiness. All 
of these elements modify the absorption and refraction of infrared radiation, hence contributing to the greenhouse effect. Source:

2.2 Protecting the Environment
2.2.1 Our Approach to Protecting our Planet 
Iveco Group is mindful that, at every stage of the production chain – from the selection and use 
of raw materials and natural resources right up to product end-of-life and disposal – it leaves 
an environmental footprint, and so requires a multifaceted approach to minimise its impact. 
Our Environmental Policy, available on our website, outlines our short-, medium-, and long-
term commitments to responsibly managing our environmental aspects (particularly energy, 
natural resources, raw materials, hazardous substances, polluting emissions, waste, natural 
habitats, and biodiversity). It also explicitly reflects our belief that efficient resource use and 
environmental impact reduction are crucial strategies in creating added value for both the 
Company and the communities in which it operates. We thus anticipate risks that could 
potentially impact the environment and human health by applying a precautionary approach 
when designing our products, managing our manufacturing processes, defining logistics 
flows, and managing end-of-life: namely, the precautionary principle introduced by the Rio 
Declaration on Environment and Development25.
An operational grievance mechanism, the Compliance Helpline, is available to our stakeholders 
to report potential violations of corporate policies, the Code of Conduct, or applicable laws.
We are committed to developing products with industry leading performance in terms of fuel 
efficiency, noise and pollutant emissions, and recoverability rate. In this regard, our sense of 
responsibility also extends to our value chain. This means that, wherever we have influence, we 
ask our suppliers, dealers, contractors, and business partners to comply with all environmental 
rules and regulations, and to adopt measures and standards that comply with our Environmental 
Policy, thus contributing to an overall improvement in environmental performance throughout 
the value chain. Furthermore, when evaluating business relationships with potential business 
partners, we take environmental issues into account and conduct due diligence as necessary. 
(25)  Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, approved by the United Nations in 1992.
REDUCING DIESEL COMBUSTION 
POLLUTION
Diesel engine combustion produces a series of pollutants including 
nitrogen oxides (NO X) and particulate matter (PM); their levels in 
exhaust gases mainly depend on the temperature of the combustion chamber, determined 
in the engine design phase. NOX gases are produced at about 1,600°C, while almost all 
PM particles burn up at high temperatures. A choice must therefore be made between 
optimised combustion, producing less PM but more NO X, or less efficient combustion, 
resulting in the emission of less NOX but more PM. Lower PM levels are achievable with 
a Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF), which requires periodic regeneration due to particulate 
build-up over time. NOX  emissions, on the other hand, can be reduced using a Selective 
Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system. FPT Industrial’s diesel engines comply with the highest 
and most stringent regulations on air quality (Euro 6/VI). The Brand’s SCR technology 
dates back to 2005, and has since further advanced significantly. The SCR systems by 
FPT Industrial are currently used in on-road, off-road, and power generation applications, 
and were present in more than 70% of the diesel engines produced as at year-end 2023.
As regards manufacturing processes, in order to make them more effective, efficient, economical, 
and environmentally friendly, we make every effort to streamline systems and technologies, 
improve existing materials and processes, and develop new materials, systems, processes, and/
or techniques. We strive to ensure that all manufacturing processes, systems, and techniques 
are technologically appropriate, technically feasible, economically viable, and eco-friendly. 
The building of our new plants abides by environmental protection criteria, taking account 
of specific local needs and the impact of construction. Newly acquired plants, on the other 
hand, are assessed according to existing processes and operations to determine the measures 
necessary to comply with our environmental management standards. It should also be noted 
that our plants contribute to mitigating the environmental impact of manufacturing processes 
through many voluntary initiatives carried out on site.

Our commitment to improving our environmental footprint is also reflected in the strategic 
sustainability targets incorporated into our Strategic Business Plan:
  75% of industrial water to be recycled at plants worldwide by year-end 2026
  100% of recoverable cores from spare parts sold to be returned to the Company  
by year-end 2030
  15% of net sales from spare parts to be generated by remanufactured components 
by year-end 2026.

2.2.2 Mitigating Plant Impacts
One of our top priorities at Iveco Group is to continuously improve the environmental 
performance of our production processes. This means adopting both conventional and enhanced 
technologies to improve operational efficiencies, and acting responsibly to mitigate their 
environmental impact. It entails implementing a robust environmental management system 
to monitor, measure, and quantify significant environmental aspects, and to set improvement 
targets at both corporate and plant levels. Just as importantly, it implies safeguarding the 
environment based on principles of prevention, protection, information sharing, and people 
engagement, so as to create effective long-term value. 
We use well-established monitoring and reporting systems (such as SPARC 26) and effective 
key performance indicators (KPIs) to track our environmental performance, measure the 
effectiveness of actions taken to achieve our targets, and plan new improvement initiatives. The 
KPIs in place at Iveco Group can be analysed at different levels (plant, business unit, geographic 
area, or Company), which enables the simultaneous and parallel engagement of multiple 
corporate functions at various levels to meet our targets. 
We also perform periodic internal and external benchmarking activities, which help drive the 
continuous improvement of our plants’ environmental performance.
2.2.2.1 RESPONSIBILITY AND ORGANISATION
The highest responsibility for Iveco Group’s environmental protection initiatives lies with our 
Senior Leadership Team (SLT), while the specific projects to reduce the environmental impact of 
our manufacturing processes are the responsibility of plant managers. 
Our central Energy, Environment, Health and Safety (EEHS) function (which serves as a reference 
point for sustainability) coordinates and manages environmental issues as per the Company’s 
Environmental Policy; it implements improvement actions at local level, periodically verifies 
performance against targets, proposes new initiatives, and defines environmental policies. An 
important role is also played by plant employees from other functions/bodies (production lines, 
logistics, manufacturing engineering, etc.) involved with environmental issues in various capacities.
In 2023, we incorporated several individual environmental impact reduction targets into the 
Performance Development Process (PDP) for several managers responsible for the projects 
(26)  Sustainability, Performance, Analysis, Reporting & Compliance.

Page 97:
97
ENVIRONMENTAL
Mitigating Climate Change Protecting the Environment Resource Circularity
indicated in our Sustainability Plan and for various plant managers. These targets aim, among 
other things, at developing new best practices and at identifying and mitigating situations or 
activities at plant level that pose a potential threat to the environment. 
We monitor our environmental performance through centralised systems, which include a 
performance indicator management tool known as SPARC 27, and an EEHS IT platform that 
provides users with training and information tools related to guidelines, procedures, best 
practices, internal reporting procedures, reporting guidelines, ISO 14001 certification, etc.
2.2.2.2 PROCESS CERTIFICATION
To enhance environmental management and performance at Iveco Group, we have committed 
to certifying our plants’ environmental management systems as per the ISO 14001 international 
standard and to maintaining such certifications. To date, 100% of our manufacturing plants 
currently in operation and falling within the scope of application of the Sustainability Report 
are ISO 14001 certified. An ISO 14001 certified environmental management system enables 
the systematic management of environmental aspects under normal and abnormal operating 
conditions as well as in emergencies. In the latter case, it requires the adoption and regular 
verification of emergency plans and procedures, and related staff training. These emergency 
procedures define roles, responsibilities, and responses for tackling anomalous and/or 
emergency situations, to protect both people and the environment. 
Maintaining environmental certification entails annual monitoring with a series of external 
third-party audits carried out by accredited bodies, and certification renewal every 3 years. 
Individual plants are also required to verify the performance of their environmental management 
systems through annual internal audits.

NANOTECHNOLOGY 
IN MANUFACTURING
Iveco Group uses nanotechnologies in the painting process for some of 
its products, specifically during the washing (pretreatment) of surfaces 
preceding the actual painting phase. Indeed, a number of our plants employ thin layer 
technology, through which nanotechnology products/nanoparticles are dosed in process 
tanks to react with the surfaces of metal substrates previously treated with a degreasing 
solution; the chemical-physical reaction triggered forms a layer of zirconium oxide that 
coats the metal surface. This treatment confers excellent resistance to corrosion and 
outstanding paint adhesion, while also reducing environmental impact and enhancing 
process quality and operational performance. The process usually takes place at room 
temperature, which means there is no vapor generation because no heat is applied. 
Chemical concentrations are very low, and product applications (spraying or dipping) 
are automated and performed in enclosed areas. Thin layer technology produces less 
sludge for disposal than traditional technology, and does not require hazardous acid 
cleaning of paint system equipment. It also cuts energy and water consumption, reduces 
wastewater, and requires less maintenance. This technology is currently in use in 2 paint 
shops at 2 plants.

Mitigating Climate Change Protecting the Environment Resource Circularity
2.2.2.3 ENGAGEMENT AND AWARENESS ACTIVITIES
In our effort to promote and disseminate the principles of continuous improvement and 
environmental management both within and outside the Company, we have implemented 
specific communication and training tools to address employees and business partners, and 
have organised targeted events to engage employees’ family members and local communities. 
We also delivered awareness training to our people, focusing on water efficiency management 
programmes, wastewater and chemical product management, waste sorting, and waste 
reduction. In all, in 2023 we provided 17,556 hours of environmental training to our 
employees, including 16,569 hours of on-the-job training for 14,587 individuals (93% of whom 
were hourly) representing 40.5% of the total workforce. 
Employee engagement and awareness were also at the centre of a series of initiatives 
implemented at plant level both at and outside manufacturing sites, some involving local 
communities and schools. 
In Europe, during Global Recycling Day celebrations, our plant in Suzzara (Italy) distributed a 
Cooking Without Waste brochure to all its employees, containing tips on avoiding food waste. It 
also organised a series of sessions with plant staff on water conservation, the circular economy, 
and recycling awareness. Meanwhile, our plant in Valladolid (Spain) collaborated with the 
regional administration to organise an eco-design workshop for 20 students to raise awareness 
of the importance of sustainable design.
In South America, the initiatives at our plants in Cordoba (Argentina) revolved around the 
circular economy. On Children’s Day, the plants donated toy trucks made of cardboard collected 
at their recycling centre to the children of their employees, and shape-sorter toys made from 
their plastic waste to children across the community. Additionally, they used their wood waste 
to build furniture for two local schools (in Los Pozos and Pampa de Achala) and a lookout tower 
(known as a mirador) for the San Martín Urban Nature Reserve. 
As might be expected, our commitment to raising awareness of environmental issues also 
extends to our suppliers and dealers.

2.2.3 Safeguarding Air Quality
One of Iveco Group’s major goals is to reduce its air emissions. The application of advanced 
technologies in our manufacturing processes is critical to meet the improvement targets that we have 
set in this regard. Our main air emissions are carefully monitored, and results systematically recorded, 
through specific programmes and systems that help us verify compliance with existing regulations. 
To date, there are no ozone-depleting substances28 (which are only found in certain equipment 
used for cooling, air conditioning, and climate control) at any of our plants falling within the 
scope of application.
2.2.3.1 VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS
In terms of volatile organic compounds (VOC) 29 emissions, painting has the greatest 
environmental impact of all manufacturing processes at Iveco Group. In 2023, our average 
VOC emissions per square metre painted decreased by 11% compared to 2022 thanks to our 
continuous management and control improvements to manufacturing processes, paired with a 
number of changes and upgrades at plant level.
(28)  Ozone-depleting substances (ODS) are potentially harmful substances that contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer. The 
most significant and harmful are chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), generally used as refrigerants, solvents, and propellants, and 
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), used to replace CFCs.
(29)  Volatile organic compounds (VOC) include compounds such as hydrocarbons, containing only carbon and hydrogen, as well as 
compounds also containing oxygen, chlorine or other elements.

In Europe, our Valladolid plant (Spain) invested €155,000 to optimise the use and recovery of 
cleaning solvents within its paint system (preventing their release into the atmosphere), leading 
to a reduction in VOC emissions of approximately 8,400 kilos.
In South America, our Truck plant in Sete Lagoas (Brazil) replaced its painting robots with 
newer, more advanced models, enhancing paint application efficiency. This €2.5 million 
investment led to an annual reduction in paint consumption, which has cut annual VOC 
emissions by 6,000 kilos. 
2.2.3.2 NOX, SOX, AND DUST EMISSIONS

matter deriving from fossil fuel combustion, since these pollutants can impact the climate, 
ecosystems, and human health.

2.2.4 Water Management
From a global perspective, it is clear to us at Iveco Group that committing to sustainable water 
management is essential given the growth in population (and therefore in water demand) 
worldwide, accompanied as it is by a marked and increasingly widespread scarcity of water 
resources. From a business angle, we recognise the economic importance of proper water 
management to counter the potential risks that water scarcity and other related issues pose to 
the continuity of both the supply chain and industrial processes. Lastly, from a manufacturing 
standpoint, we believe that the proper management of water resources can drive improvement 
and innovation within production processes. 
Iveco Group draws water mainly for industrial use, specifically for painting, cooling, washing, 
and machining, and strives to increase water efficiency within all its industrial processes 
(regional and environmental circumstances permitting). Efforts are made not only at Company 
level, but also at individual plant level, through water use assessments to identify opportunities 
for water efficiency improvements, and operations implemented locally to reduce water 
requirements and wastewater volumes without compromising quality standards. 
Our approach to water management is to increase the use of recycled water to reduce our 
withdrawals from external sources, thus improving water independence and the availability of 
water for local communities. From a broader perspective, given that water is a resource shared 
with other stakeholders, it is important to ensure collaboration on water management, as well 
as joint efforts to improve community health and wellbeing, especially in water-stressed areas 
(see 2.2.4.1 Plants in Water-Stressed Areas  ).
Impact on water resources is an integral part of each plant’s environmental assessment, as 
required by the ISO 14001 standard; for this reason, all of our 22 ISO 14001 certified plants 
(see 4.2.1.2 Data Coverage  ) have a water management plan in place. 

Page 100:
100
ENVIRONMENTAL
Mitigating Climate Change Protecting the Environment Resource Circularity
Iveco Group’s Water Management Guidelines apply to all plants and require them to: 
 • analyse their water consumption and withdrawal/distribution management systems, and 
identify and eliminate leaks and/or waste 
 • identify specific performance indicators and benchmarking for the different manufacturing 
processes 
 • identify the manufacturing processes with the greatest impact on water resources, and 
prioritise the necessary interventions 
 • adopt changes and technological innovations to boost water use efficiency, reduce 
consumption, and improve the quality of wastewater
 • promote water recirculation within individual manufacturing processes and its reuse in 
multiple processes 
 • raise staff awareness of responsible water use, both at work and at home.
All of our targets associated with water management are to be achieved by year-end 2026. Based on two of them, we 
are aiming to achieve a 15% reduction in water withdrawal per production unit at Company plants worldwide, com -
pared to 2019, as well as a 75% Water Recycling Index. As regards the latter, we already recycle 75% of the water 
across our plants. 
In terms of water withdrawal per production unit 30, the key performance indicator (KPI) for 
2023 dropped by almost 9% compared to 2022.
(30) The production unit corresponds to the hour of production. Total manufacturing hours are used to calculate the normalised 
production unit indicator. For the definition of total manufacturing hours, see 4.2.2.1.2 Environmental Data Calculation .

(a) Calculated as total water withdrawal minus total water discharge.
In 2023, several initiatives were carried out to provide a detailed picture of water consumption 
at plant level and reduce our plants’ water footprint. 
In Europe, our plant in Madrid (Spain) was able to increase the quantity of recycled water used 
in its rain test chamber by improving the latter’s recirculation system and by devising a solution 
that enables the reuse of water from the central heating system. With a total investment of 
€54,500, these measures allow for an annual increase in the amount of water recycled by the 
plant of approximately 17,000 cubic metres (and thus a decrease in water withdrawal from the 
municipal supply), generating around €38,000 in estimated cost savings.
In Italy, our plant in Suzzara invested €70,000 in a nanofiltration unit to increase water 
recycling during pretreatment prior to painting. This has cut the plant’s annual demineralised 
water consumption by 13,000 cubic metres, generating about €110,000 in cost savings. 
In addition, the project also led to a reduction of 50,000 kilos in sludge from subsequent 
wastewater treatments.
Meanwhile, our Torino Motori plant equipped its metrology lab with a recirculating cooling 
system, which replaces its former once-through system. This €250,000 investment has led to 
a significant reduction in well water withdrawal (about 100,000 cubic metres per year) and to 
approximately €50,000 in annual cost savings. 
In addition to promoting responsible water withdrawal and introducing appropriate measures 
through ad hoc initiatives, it is extremely important to the Company to safeguard the water 
bodies that receive the effluents from its industrial processes – as reflected in our efforts to 
exceed local wastewater requirements. 
To this end, our plants rely on established operating procedures to ensure that the wastewater 
discharged during their manufacturing processes meets required quality standards. Indeed, 
the 3 wastewater quality indicators applied by Iveco Group – biochemical oxygen demand 
(BOD)31, chemical oxygen demand (COD)32, and total suspended solids (TSS)33 – showed that 
our performance in 2023 was fully compliant with applicable local limits. 
This result was achieved partly thanks to the adoption of specific wastewater treatment systems 
(operated either in-house or by specialised industry partners) that treat the water discharged 
from the plants; this mainly involves physical and chemical processes and, depending on 
wastewater quality, biological treatment. 
(31)  Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) is the total mass of oxygen used by microorganisms, over a specific time period at 20°C, to 
decompose (oxidise) the organic material present in a litre of water (normally expressed in mg/l). The standard test period for BOD 
is 5 days (BOD5).
(32)  Chemical oxygen demand (COD), expressed in milligrams per litre (mg/l), is the quantity of oxygen required for the complete chemical 
oxidation of organic and inorganic compounds present in a sample of water.
(33)  Total suspended solids (TSS) is the parameter used in water quality management and in water purification to indicate the quantity 
of solids present in suspension, which can be separated by vigorous mechanical means such as vacuum filtration or centrifugation 
of the water sample.

As regards substances of concern (SoC), these are defined by local law and restricted 
accordingly, and are therefore considered a priority; consequently, each plant is required to 
monitor and treat SoC discharges as per local provisions. 
It should be noted that our plants do not use wastewater generated by other organisations, nor 
do they channel their effluents for reuse by other organisations.
2.2.4.1 PLANTS IN WATER-STRESSED AREAS
A few of our plants were classified in 2022 as being in areas considered sensitive in terms 
of availability and use of water resources (so-called water-stressed areas 34): our two plants 
in Brescia and the one in Foggia (all in Italy) and our plants in Madrid and Valladolid 
(Spain). These areas were identified using the WRI 35 Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, a mapping 
tool recognised by the major organisations in the field, through which the list of countries that 
contain water-stressed areas is monitored annually to identify Iveco Group plants where specific 
water conservation and protection measures are needed.
Accordingly, the aforementioned plants focused on reducing their water consumption 
throughout the year by implementing targeted measures and initiatives and by setting specific 
improvement targets (see 4.1.3 Life Cycle Thinking  ).
2.2.5 Protecting the Soil and Subsoil
We strive to minimise the risk of environmental impact on the soil and subsoil around our sites. 
In Europe, for example, following the circulation of specific guidelines for monitoring existing 
underground structures, plants periodically carry out the monitoring and inspection of tanks, 
vats, and underground pipes. 
As a result, our Truck plant in Brescia (Italy) decommissioned some of its underground storage 
tanks to prevent any accidental spills contaminating the soil. The activity involved 7 diesel tanks 
and 1 antifreeze tank, for a total volume of 350 cubic metres. 
Similarly, the plant in Suzzara (Italy) removed 5 underground storage tanks (including 3 
previously used for diesel, 1 for antifreeze, and 1 for windshield washer fluid), for a total volume 
of 105 cubic metres.
In 2023, no significant releases of potentially contaminating substances were recorded.

2.2.6 Waste Management
Iveco Group works to optimise manufacturing processes and operations across its plants not 
only to enhance its end products, but also to improve waste management. This means reducing 
the generation of both hazardous and non-hazardous waste while increasing recovery, two key 
aspects of our Environmental Policy. 
The manufacturing processes at our plants normally involve numerous raw materials – such as 
metals, plastics, chemical products, and components – each with their own packaging and each 
generating actual and potential waste-related impacts. The same applies to most manufacturing 
activities, such as assembly, machining, painting, welding, testing, logistics, etc.
When waste generated by our activities is managed by third parties, the latter’s waste collection 
and storage operations are inspected and checked to ensure the waste is handled in line with 
contractual or legislative obligations.
Our commitment to optimising waste management is shared across our plants, which seek 
solutions that facilitate waste recovery and minimise material sent to landfill. To this end, plants 
analyse their production chains to identify areas where waste performance can be improved – 
particularly seeking solutions that increase waste recovery and reuse. They also set up action 
plans and allocate dedicated R&D resources to reduce waste production and limit the associated 
risks. The waste management improvement methods adopted, in order of preference, are waste 
recovery, waste-to-energy conversion, and waste treatment.
In terms of waste disposal, the Company selects appropriate methods either directly or in 
consultation with waste disposal contractors.

The results we achieved in 2023 demonstrate the extent of our commitment to managing 
this important environmental aspect. Indeed, the waste recovered at Company level during 
the year increased compared to 2022, reaching 97.5% of the total waste generated. In terms 
of waste generated per production unit36 compared to 2022, the total waste indicator fell by 
approximately 2% while the hazardous waste indicator fell by 5%. 
These excellent results were made possible by performance improvements in each geographic 
area, and are in line with our commitment to sustainable waste management set out in the 
Iveco Group Sustainability Plan.

At Iveco Group, we understand the importance of protecting and enhancing biodiversity in the 
areas surrounding our plants, in line with our Company policies. 
To assess some of our manufacturing sites near protected areas of particular environmental 
interest, we employ the biodiversity value index (BVI) methodology. It provides for an in-depth 
analysis of ecosystems within a 5-kilometre radius of these sites, determining biodiversity levels 
and identifying improvement measures accordingly. 
Our approach to biodiversity also encompasses a second methodology, known as biodiversity 
risk evaluation (BRE), which focuses on the activities and impact of our plants and on the 
significant risks they may pose to biodiversity and natural resources, regardless of their 
contribution to the overall activities and impacts reported in the surrounding areas. 
The BRE assesses the following 3 main aspects: 
 • assets – the resources available in the region (protected areas, areas with high biodiversity 
value, protected species)
 • footprint – the impact of plant activities on biodiversity, in terms of use of resources and 
polluting emissions 
 • awareness – the level of environmental awareness among plant employees and 
stakeholders in the region. 
The BRE assessment generates a risk map for each plant indicating its potential damage to 
biodiversity. These maps are used to determine improvement measures (which are implemented 
based on the scores assigned to each risk) and to identify standardised indicators (which enable 
a consistent comparison between different plants’ risk maps).
The BRE and BVI methodologies are used to establish a mitigation hierarchy for plant operations 
within areas of high biodiversity value. After an initial screening assessment to identify high-
priority plants located near such sensitive areas, the two methods are applied using a multi-
criteria scoring system to measure the risks to and impacts on biodiversity of such operations. 
Finally, mitigation and restoration measures are implemented based on the main risks identified 
and the potential involvement of local stakeholders. 
Both BRE and BVI measure the potential environmental impact of plant operations on biodiversity 
based on their biodiversity footprint, which is quantified using the ReCiPe 2016 life cycle impact 
assessment method. This translates material and energy inputs and outputs into potential 
In 2023, our plants completed several waste-reduction initiatives, including circularity measures 
and recycling programmes to reduce total waste disposal, to manage its significant impacts, 
and to work towards zero waste across our operations. 
Our Madrid plant (Spain) reduced its total hazardous waste generation by about 17 tons per 
year by sourcing its windshield washer fluid in bulk using tanker trucks instead of the usual 
1,000-litre tanks, which previously were disposed of as waste after use. For an investment of 
about €190,000, the initiative led to approximately €290,000 in annual cost savings.
The Vysoke Myto plant (Czech Republic) reduced its total waste generation by about 7.5 tons 
per year and saved about €99,000 by returning the clean, empty drums used to carry sealant to 
the supplier for reuse, so that now only the drums’ plastic lining is discarded as waste. 
Our plant in Annonay (France) and our Truck plant in Cordoba (Argentina) launched circular 
economy initiatives to reduce the use of disposable plastic cups and bottles, raising awareness 
among employees of the importance of reusing materials to cut waste.

environmental impact scores, which are further aggregated so that the potential damage to 
biodiversity is expressed in time-integrated species loss (TISL, i.e., potential species loss per year). 
The application of both methods often involves external partners and stakeholders; their 
engagement is important both in the risk assessment phase, to measure their level of awareness 
of biodiversity conservation, and in the follow-up phase, when specific mitigation measures are 
implemented. In both cases, partnerships are encouraged with authorities, NGOs, and public or 
private third parties managing protected areas. The methods themselves were developed with 
the support of external partners.
The BVI and BRE methodologies revealed that biodiversity and ecosystem services at all the 
plants assessed to date were generally subject to insignificant levels of risk and impact overall.
Although no specific improvement measures were required following the adoption of these 
methodologies, a number of initiatives are being implemented to protect biodiversity within and 
around the plants that adopted them. Regarding our sites near, bordering, or within protected 
or high-biodiversity areas, the two methodologies have been implemented at about 92% of 
such plants falling within the scope of application; their extension to potentially suitable plants 
will be assessed over the coming years.
ADVANCING ENVIRONMENTAL
PROTECTION
In Europe, the Vysoke Myto  plant (Czech Republic) continued to 
engage in initiatives to protect local flora and fauna by sponsoring the 
Pasicka Wildlife Rescue Station near the village of Bor u Skutce, which rescues injured 
wild animals in the Pardubice region before nursing them back to health and returning 
them to their natural habitat. 
In South America, our plants in Cordoba (Argentina) used their waste materials to build 
a greenhouse for growing native tree species for reforestation. They also planted 300 
seedlings in La Calera Natural Defense Reserve and 250 trees in the Parque General San 
Martín Nature Reserve, with the assistance of Company volunteers and their families. 
2.2.8 Other Environmental 
Indicators
We are also concerned with reducing other environmental indicators, most notably hazardous 
substances and noise emissions to the external environment generated by our equipment and 
manufacturing processes. As regards hazardous substances, no PCBs37 or PCTs38 are present in 
the operations carried out at Iveco Group. 
In 2023, no fines or sanctions for non-compliance related to ecological or environmental issues 
(including water) were imposed on Iveco Group’s plants.
2.2.8.1 SUBSTANCES OF PARTICULAR CONCERN FOR HEALTH AND 
THE ENVIRONMENT
Iveco Group is strongly committed to adopting alternatives to certain substances identified as 
of particular concern for human health and the environment, and especially to studying and 
implementing alternatives to heavy metal-containing products used in painting processes. More 
broadly, we are committed to the sustainable and reduced use of chemicals, with a view to 
environmental protection, waste reduction, and cost savings. 
At each site that handles hazardous substances, the latter are labelled, stored, handled, and 
transported as per all applicable local regulations. 
2.2.8.2 EXTERNAL NOISE GENERATED BY PLANTS 
Iveco Group seeks to minimise the noise impact of its plants, and so encourages the adoption 
of procedures provided for by plant environmental management systems and by the guidelines 
in place (such as those for the design and purchase of new, low-noise machinery).
(37) Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a group of extremely stable chemical compounds with excellent dielectric and heat transfer 
properties, widely used in the past in both the industrial and commercial sectors (e.g., in capacitors and transformers). Because of 
their toxicity to humans and to the environment, PCBs are among the most dangerous pollutants
(38) Polychlorinated terphenyls (PCTs) have physical and chemical properties similar to PCBs, and may contain up to 10% PCBs within 
the product matrix. They have been used as plasticisers, fire retardants, and in various types of coating.

Life cycle thinking is one of Iveco Group’s sustainability priorities, whereby applying a circular 
product life cycle approach ensures resources are used fully and for as long as possible. Our 
goals in this area are:
 • to design all new products in alignment with sustainability and recyclability guidelines, 
looking at materials, technologies, and reuse potential from the very first stage of product 
development in order to maximise the life cycle of our products. Through product life cycle 
assessments (LCAs), we collect data on exact material composition and estimate the 
recyclability rates for each
 • to collect broken or worn-out parts to identify which can be reused, repurposed or recycled, 
and offer our customers a consistent range of remanufactured products, with the aim of 
improving our capability to increase waste recovery and reuse as well as water recycling 
at our plants worldwide 
 • to increase our use of electricity from renewable sources.
Our Circular Approach applies to every phase involved in the lifespan of our products, from their eco-design, using sustainability and/or recyclability criteria, to their subsequent production, distribution, use, repair, end-of-life, and eco-recovery.
During the initial eco-design and production phases, a crucial step consists in the selection of the raw materials and components to be used.
Every effort is then made to optimise the use of renewable electricity and recycled water during the production phase, whereas the focus during the use phase is on biofuels.
The Repair phase involves the remanufacturing of worn components where feasible. When components reach their end-of-life, on the other hand, they are reused or recycled if possible.

2.3.1 Reverse Supply Chain
During the design phase, Iveco Group promotes the development of products using 
raw materials and/or components that can be easily dismantled, repaired, recovered, 
remanufactured or recycled. Every year, our brands supply about 45 million spare parts through 
their dealerships and workshops. In 2023, the percentage of spare parts that could be either 
reused or recycled reached approximately 40%. Our goal is to maximise the adoption of a 
circular economy approach under our 5R project, and to generate new business through the 
centralised management of components over their entire service life. This approach allows us 
to offer customers spare parts of the highest quality, and to manage component end-of-life in 
an environmentally friendly manner. 
Through our 5R project, the cores from spare parts sold are returned to the parent company, 
after which they undergo one of five processes:
 • remanufacture: cores undergo a regeneration process
 • repair: cores are repaired
 • reuse: cores are still functional and are therefore refurbished and sold to customers as 
used
 • recover: cores are disassembled, and the raw materials are either recovered by certified 
suppliers or reintegrated directly into the Company’s production cycle
 • recycle: cores are recycled in an eco-friendly manner by certified companies.
Remanufacturing worn components (cores) reduces waste, reuses materials, and encourages 
recycling. Additionally, by avoiding the extraction of new raw materials, we reduce both energy use 
and greenhouse gas emissions. Remanufacturing cores is an industrial process that ensures the 
same standards of operational performance as new, original equipment components, triggering 
a virtuous cycle of savings in raw materials and reductions in materials going to landfill. This 
process ensures reliability and reduced vehicle downtime for customers at competitive prices. 
Furthermore, remanufactured FPT Industrial engines and transmissions include a 36-month 
warranty, which is three times the genuine parts’ warranty period. Iveco Group manages the 
overall remanufacturing process, from the collection of cores from dealerships to the stocking of 
remanufactured products and their sale to end customers. As a result, our portfolio includes a full 
range of original spare parts to cover the entire life cycle of many of our products, as well as a 
broad selection of remanufactured components. This allows us to offer like-new quality products, 
extended warranties, and good value since remanufactured parts save the customer an average 
30% on list price. A strategic sustainability target for remanufacturing was incorporated into 
our Strategic Business Plan:    to ensure that 15% of net sales from spare parts are 
generated by remanufactured components by year-end 2026.  In 2023, the net sales 
from remanufactured components were 7.7% at global level and 8.9% at European level. This 
sustainability target was also included in the Sustainability Plan and as an individual goal in the 
Performance Development Process (PDP).
The repair process is currently available at our dealers for less complex components, and at our 
plants for FPT Industrial engines. 
For reuse, two options are currently available: the first is the recovery of the main engine 
components that are still in good shape. These are resold as used parts, and often utilised to 
repair vehicles with minimal residual value. After dismantling, the parts are cleaned, inspected, 
allocated a specific part number, and packaged. The benefit to customers is being able to 
purchase a part at half the price of the genuine one. The second option is to buy back unsold 
parts from dealers. These are put on sale, a preferable alternative to them lying unused in the 
warehouse for later disposal.
Recovery is currently only available for noble metals; however, we are working to extend it to 
other metal types. In 2023, we recovered 45% of engine components for selected engines, and 
have a medium-to long-term target of 80%.
Recycling is the final stage of our circular economy approach, applied to rejected parts or 
those not suitable for the other 4 processes. 
In 2022, we began looking into the development of a structured, competitive reverse supply 
chain to identify new approaches to improve our 5R effectiveness, including enhanced 
ICT design and cost-efficient reverse logistics flows. The study is still underway. A strategic 
sustainability target regarding the 5R project was incorporated into our Strategic Business Plan:    
  100% of recoverable cores from spare parts sold to be returned to the Company 
by year-end 2030. This sustainability target was also included in the Sustainability Plan and 
as an individual goal in the Performance Development Process (PDP). As at 31 December 2023, 
we had collected 30% of the recoverable cores from spare parts sold globally, which we reused, 
remanufactured or recycled, for a financial benefit of €119.7 million.

2.3.2 Reusable packaging 
In December 2022, we launched a Packaging Project  to streamline our parts packaging 
processes. With the clear objective of identifying improvement areas to reduce our environmental 
impact, we analysed our entire parts shipping operation, focusing on the two main processes 
that take place in our warehouses: the receipt and storage of parts from suppliers, and the 
selection and packing of parts for shipment to the service network. 
On receiving a shipment, the packaging (almost always made of cardboard) must somehow 
be disposed of. Thanks to shredding machines installed at our warehouses under this project, 
we are now able to reuse carboard packaging rather than discard it. Indeed, shredded into 
perforated strips, it is being employed in place of plastic as a packing filler, protecting and 
separating the individual packages to be shipped to the service network. Based on our 
estimates, the shredding machines at our warehouses in Turin (Italy) alone would allow us to 
recover 1,240 tons of carboard per year for later reuse (with the perforated strips totalling about 
2,455 kilometres in length), and therefore to cut our annual plastic packaging consumption. 
Besides reducing packaging, the project has also allowed us to explore new ways to optimise it 
by saturating box capacity to save space and minimise costs, in line with best practices adopted 
by all our warehouses globally. Since December 2022, the new methods put in place have cut 
our plastic consumption by 53 tons and paper consumption by 3 tons, reducing CO2 emissions 
by about 310 tons. 
While the Packaging Project focuses mainly on the management of spare parts, other initiatives 
launched at our plants in 2023 centre on reducing packaging waste according to the 5Rs of 
waste management – particularly the Reuse principle.
Our plant in Madrid (Spain) focused on reducing the amount of disposable packaging used to 
deliver materials by using reusable containers, which cut the plant’s annual packaging waste by 
approximately 160,000 kilos and its respective disposal costs by circa €200,000.
Meanwhile, our plant in Rorthais (France) managed to reduce its annual cardboard packaging 
waste by approximately 4,000 kilos by investing about €36,000 in the creation of 75 new 
reusable metal containers for supplying materials to the site. It also invested approximately 
€12,000 in a project to reduce its wooden packaging waste, entailing the return of material 
containers to the suppliers for subsequent reuse. This initiative cut the plant’s annual wooden 
packaging waste by approximately 3,000 kilos and its respective disposal costs. 
2.3.3 End-of-Life Batteries
Iveco Group’s end-of-life battery strategy is based on the circular economy model, following 
the 4R approach – repair, refurbish, repurpose, and recycle – to increase batteries’ lifespan, 
decrease their overall environmental impacts, and remain compliant with the principles of 
Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), which holds producers responsible for the entire life 
cycle of their products, from design to end-of-life.
With the introduction of our new electric vehicles, we have started to produce high-voltage 
batteries at our ePowertrain plant in Turin (Italy), and have established a process to manage 
their end-of-life based on EPR principles. Furthermore, to facilitate used battery collection and 
recycling in every European country, we have signed a number of contracts with the service 
providers operating in each. 
Thanks to these agreements, when a customer returns an end-of-life vehicle to a dealership, 
the latter will assess whether the battery is viable for remanufacturing or repurposing, or, if not, 
will contact the relevant service provider to initiate the recycling process. The selected service 
providers, who handle battery collection from dealers and their transport and subsequent 
recycling, have the capability to recycle most battery components and materials through a 
series of disassembly processes.

GIVING USED ELECTRIC-VEHICLE 
BATTERIES A SECOND LIFE
In 2023, FPT Industrial and Reefilla launched a pilot project aimed at 
reusing electric vehicle (EV) batteries once their service life has expired 
– in particular the eBS 37 battery manufactured by FPT Industrial at its ePowertrain 
plant in Turin (Italy) and used in the IVECO eDaily and minibus. Founded in Turin in April 
2021 as part of the I3P startup incubator and supported by Motor Valley Accelerator, 
Reefilla has developed an ecosystem of charging products and services for electric 
mobility. It currently offers predictive mobile charging for commercial fleets and private 
users in Turin and Milan (Italy). When eBS 37 batteries are no longer able to charge EVs, 
they will be sent to Reefilla, which will recover their modules and over 50% of their 
internal components. These will then be reused and installed in Reefilla’s Fillee mobile 
power banks, significantly increasing their charging capacity. The mobile power banks 
will then be delivered to customers by a fleet of electric vans to charge their electric 
vehicles, both on demand and, as the service is predictive, without even having to ask. 
FPT Industrial launched the pilot project just six months after launching production of 
its eBS 37 batteries, creating a fully sustainable life cycle that handles batteries from 
production to reuse. The aim is to actively contribute to the carbon-neutral supply chain 
of electric mobility while promoting the circular economy. Moreover, the solution is 
fully compatible with the new eBS 37 EVO battery, soon to be launched on the market, 
developed entirely by FPT Industrial and fully compliant with the rigorous requirements of 
the ECE Regulation 100 Rev.3. For some time now, FPT Industrial has operated according 
to the 5R approach – Repair, Remanufacture, Reuse, Recover, and Recycle – providing 
customers with a product management methodology and a range of services that ensure 
environmental and financial sustainability throughout the entire life cycle of its products 
and their components.
2.3.4 Giving Vehicles a Second Life 
IVECO Certified Pre-Owned is a new brand (created from IVECO’s former OK TRUCKS brand) 
that reconditions and sells used vehicles following servicing and certification by IVECO itself. 
The new brand demonstrates IVECO’s commitment to sustainability by giving vehicles a 
second life, resulting in a vast offering of IVECO-certified pre-owned commercial vehicles and 
trucks (also available in natural gas versions). The vehicles handled by IVECO Certified Pre-
Owned, which are returned to IVECO through its Buy Back and Trade In programmes, are fully 
inspected and reconditioned before being authorised for resale. After collection by IVECO, they 
are exhaustively assessed by independent third parties, with 120 checks and inspections to 
ensure the condition and operational reliability of the following components: interiors, on-
board electric and electronic systems, cabs, bodywork, chassis, braking systems, engines, fuel 
systems, gearboxes and distributors, clutches, cooling, heating and air-conditioning systems, 
equipment, and hydraulic systems. All servicing and checks follow set procedures using only 
original IVECO parts and components. Once duly reconditioned, and after each in-house 
certification step has been passed, each vehicle is offered to customers as a used vehicle that is 
both reliable and in perfect condition. IVECO Certified Pre-Owned also offers a complete range 
of services, comparable to those for new vehicles. These include the official IVECO warranty 
(valid throughout Europe), regular maintenance and repair programmes, driver and vehicle 
after-sales support, IVECO’s 24/7 Assistance Non-Stop (ANS) freephone service, connectivity 
services, and dedicated, customisable leasing and finance solutions.
The IVECO Certified Pre-Owned network (with over 150 dealerships, mainly in Europe) provides 
a team of professionals to assist customers in selecting the most suitable used vehicles for 
their business needs. This ensures they attain the best value for money and lowest total cost of 
ownership (TCO) – which already benefits from the purchase of a used vehicle. The new brand 
is present in over 25 European countries and is affiliated with the entire network of IVECO 
workshops. This means customers have access to the same standard of service and support as 
if they had purchased a new vehicle fresh from the factory. IVECO’s commitment to extending 
product life cycles through IVECO Certified Pre-Owned supports a sustainable business model, 
as expressed by its new claim: IVECO Certified Pre-Owned: the reliable choice for a sustainable 
second life.

3.1 Human and Labour Rights Management
3.1.1 Our Regulations
At Iveco Group, we work hard to create long-term sustainable value for all our stakeholders, an 
objective that we believe cannot be achieved without respect for fundamental human rights. 
We uphold the protection of these rights in all our operations, and seek to promote respect for 
the same principles by others over whom we have an influence, particularly our contractors, 
suppliers, and all other entities and individuals with whom we have a business relationship. 
Furthermore, we will not establish or continue a relationship with any counterpart that refuses 
to respect the principles of the Iveco Group Code of Conduct, which explicitly endorses the 
protection of human rights.
Our commitment to these principles is also specified in our Human Rights Policy, which 
supplements the Iveco Group Code of Conduct, and in our Supplier Code of Conduct, both of 
which are available on the Company’s website.
While it is the responsibility of all covered persons 1 to ensure respect for human rights, 
our Senior Leadership Team (SLT) retains executive oversight and has responsibility for the 
implementation of the Human Rights Policy. Iveco Group’s Board of Directors oversees the 
policy’s implementation at Company level and is responsible for ensuring adherence to the 
commitments therein, while Company managers are responsible for overseeing its application 
at local level.
The human rights principles included in the aforementioned documents are consistent with 
the spirit and intent of the United Nations’ (UN) Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 
OECD2 Guidelines for Multinational Companies, and the relevant Declaration on Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work of the International Labour Organization (ILO).
(1) Covered persons collectively include: Iveco Group N.V . and its subsidiaries; the directors, officers, and employees of such entities; and 
those acting for or on behalf of such entities, comprising all parties with whom the Company conducts business, including, but not 
limited to: suppliers, service providers, sales representatives, agents, consultants, dealers, distributors, importers, resellers, and joint 
venture partners.
(2) Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
The Company’s Code of Conduct and policies apply to all directors, officers, and employees, as 
well as to those acting for or on behalf of all Iveco Group companies worldwide. As regards our 
suppliers, in addition to their adherence to the values outlined in the Code of Conduct, their 
selection is also based on their social and environmental performance.
Iveco Group handles the risks associated with human rights violations through its Enterprise 
Risk Management (ERM) system. Based on our ERM methodology, a risk is defined as any event 
that could affect our ability to meet our objectives. This approach enables us to identify risks 
and evaluate their significance in a timely manner, giving us the ability to take action to mitigate 
and, where possible, eliminate them.
There are specific procedures in place at Iveco Group to monitor respect for human rights across 
our operations, enabling us to assess the potential impact of our activities in this regard and 
implement mitigating and preventative measures where needed. To this end, a Compliance 
Helpline is available to all Iveco Group employees, customers, suppliers, and other third parties 
to report potential violations of applicable laws, Company policies or the Code of Conduct.
In addition, we offer training on specific human rights issues. In 2023, online training on 
human rights and other Code of Conduct aspects was made available to approximately 12,415 
employees worldwide (salaried and above), for a total of 4,553 hours3, and a specific human 
rights course – Professional Conduct: Supporting an Environment of Respect – was delivered 
to approximately 11,596 employees, for a total of 5,488 hours.

3.1.1.1 HUMAN AND LABOUR RIGHTS FOCUS AREAS
Iveco Group’s approach to the management of human and labour rights focuses on the 
following 8 main areas.
3.1.1.1.1 No Child Labour
As stated in our Code of Conduct, Iveco Group prohibits the employment of child labour – 
specifically, of anyone younger than the minimum legal working age in force where the work 
is carried out and, in any case, of anyone younger than 15, unless an exception is expressly 
provided for by international conventions and by local legislation. We also refrain from 
establishing or maintaining business relationships with suppliers that employ child labour. For 
information on how we address this aspect in the management of our supply chain, see 3.3.1 
Our Management Approach to the Supply Chain  .
3.1.1.1.2 No Forced Labour, Human Trafficking, or any form of Slavery
As set forth in our Human Rights Policy, Iveco Group does not tolerate the use of forced or 
mandatory labour, slavery, human trafficking, or sex trafficking by any covered person4. Human 
trafficking is defined as arranging or facilitating the recruitment, transportation, transfer, 
harbouring, or receipt of people through force, fraud or deception, with the aim of exploiting 
them for profit. It is immaterial whether these people are coerced or deceived into consenting 
to such activities.
Similarly, our Supplier Code of Conduct states that no supplier may employ forced labour or 
engage in any form of human trafficking (whether by force, fraud or coercion), and that all forms 
of involuntary servitude, slavery, forced labour, sex trafficking, and commercial sex activities are 
strictly prohibited. For information on how we address this aspect in the management of our 
supply chain, see 3.3.1 Our Management Approach to the Supply Chain  . 
3.1.1.1.3 Working Conditions
As per our Human Rights Policy, we ensure that all employees receive the legally mandated 
minimum wage and benefits, or higher; and that working conditions, working hours, and 
compensation are fair and comply with the laws, standards, and practices of each country 
of operation. Similarly, overtime at Iveco Group is performed and remunerated according to 
applicable local laws and customs, collective labour agreements, or industry standards. We also 
hire contract workers to respond to temporary needs for manpower during peak production 
times or for other purposes within the limits set by local legislation.
(4) Covered persons collectively include: Iveco Group N.V . and its subsidiaries; the directors, officers, and employees of such entities; and 
those acting for or on behalf of such entities, comprising all parties with whom the Company conducts business, including, but not 
limited to: suppliers, service providers, sales representatives, agents, consultants, dealers, distributors, importers, resellers, and joint 
venture partners.

3.1.1.1.4 No Harassment 
As stated in our Human Rights Policy, harassment can take many forms, all of which are 
considered cruel, inhumane, and/or degrading. We prohibit and do not tolerate any type of 
harassment at Iveco Group. By way of example, racial or sexual harassment, or harassment 
related to other personal characteristics (the purpose or effect of which is to create a hostile 
work environment, violating the dignity of the person who is the victim of such harassment), 
or any type of demand for sexual favours in exchange for a workplace advantage (e.g., as a 
condition for hiring, promoting, or not firing someone) is totally unacceptable to the Company, 
whether it takes place inside or outside the workplace.
3.1.1.1.5 No Discrimination 
As per our Human Rights Policy, Iveco Group does not accept discrimination against employees 
in any form on the basis of: ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, personal or social status, 
health, physical condition, disability, age, nationality, religious or personal beliefs, political 
opinion, or other protected status. The Company recruits and hires employees on the basis of 
their experience, knowledge, and skills, and is committed to providing equal opportunities to all 
employees, both on the job and in their career advancement5.
The head of Human Resources of each business unit/function, in collaboration with all personnel 
managers, is required to ensure that in every aspect of the employment relationship – be 
it recruitment, training, compensation, promotion, transfer, or termination – employees are 
treated according to their abilities to meet job requirements, and all decisions are free from any 
form of discrimination.
Through our Supplier Code of Conduct, our suppliers are also required to treat their workers in 
a fair and non-discriminatory manner, guaranteeing equal opportunities and the absence of any 
policy aimed at, or indirectly resulting in, discrimination towards them on any basis whatsoever, 
including but not limited to: ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, social or personal status, 
health, physical condition, disability, age, nationality, religious or personal beliefs, political 
opinion, or other prohibited basis (in accordance with applicable laws).
For further information on how Iveco Group manages diversity and equal opportunities, see 
3.2.3 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion  .
For information on how we address this aspect in the management of our supply chain, see 
3.3.1 Our Management Approach to the Supply Chain  .
(5) As per Convention No. 111 of the International Labour Organization (ILO).
3.1.1.1.6 No Retaliation
As stated in our Human Rights Policy, it is prohibited at Iveco Group to retaliate in any way 
against someone for reporting in good faith a violation of this or any other Company policy, 
the Code of Conduct, or applicable laws; or for participating in the investigation of a reported 
violation. Any instance of retaliation may result in disciplinary action, up to and including 
termination of employment.
3.1.1.1.7 Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining
As per our Human Rights Policy, Iveco Group recognises that employees are free to join (or 
not join) a trade union, and respects their right to be represented by said unions (or other 
representatives established in accordance with applicable local legislation and practice) and to 
participate in collective bargaining. When engaging in negotiations with such representatives, 
the Company seeks a constructive approach and relationship 6. The same principles apply to 
our suppliers, which are required to allow their workers to freely join associations and bargain 
collectively, in accordance with local law, without interference, discrimination, retaliation, or 
harassment (see 3.3.1 Our Management Approach to the Supply Chain  ).
For further information on freedom of association and collective bargaining, see 3.2.8.1 
Freedom of Association  .
For information on how we address this aspect in the management of our supply chain, see 
3.3.1 Our Management Approach to the Supply Chain  .
3.1.1.1.8 Occupational Health and Safety
At Iveco Group, we consider health and safety in the workplace not only a fundamental 
employee right, but also a key component of our sustainability efforts, a prerequisite of every 
choice we make. 
Our approach to occupational health and safety is both effective and constantly evolving, 
with preventive measures implemented at both individual and collective levels to minimise the 
potential for injury in the workplace. We seek to ensure industry-leading working conditions, 
in accordance with principles of hygiene, industrial ergonomics, and individual organisational 
and operational processes. 
(6) As per Conventions No. 87 and 98 of the International Labour Organization (ILO).
GRI

Human and Labour Rights Management
SOCIAL
Our People Our Suppliers Our Dealership Our Customers Local Communities116
Iveco Group also believes in, and actively promotes, a culture of accident prevention and risk 
awareness among workers, through training and information. All employees are required to 
act responsibly and follow all preventive measures for the protection of health and safety 
as per Company directives, which are circulated via targeted communications, instructions, 
informational material, and training (see the Health and Safety Policy available on the 
Company’s website  ).
Suppliers are also required to provide and maintain a safe work environment in compliance with 
all applicable laws, as per the Supplier Code of Conduct.
For further information on occupational health and safety, see 3.2.5 Occupational Health and 
Safety  .
For information on how we address this aspect in the management of our supply chain, see 
3.3.1 Our Management Approach to the Supply Chain  .
Given the increasing focus on human and labour rights at national and international level, 
Iveco Group endeavours to contribute to the relevant policy debate, such as on the UN 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and regarding EU measures on responsible 
business conduct. Indeed, we have engaged with both Italy’s Inter-ministerial Committee on 
Human Rights and its Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, and with 
sector associations at national and EU level, to address human rights issues from a business 
perspective and share best practices.
3.1.1.2 CONFLICT MINERALS
Another demonstration of Iveco Group’s respect for human rights is its stand against the use 
of natural resources extracted in conflict zones. To this end, we have adopted a compliance 
programme and a Conflict Minerals Policy intended to promote the responsible sourcing 
of tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold  (referred to as conflict minerals or 3TG) from the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and other countries or areas considered at high risk 
of conflict7, where revenues from their extraction have historically funded armed conflict and 
human rights abuses.
(7) See CAHRAs list 
Our Conflict Minerals Policy and the General Purchasing Terms and Conditions (GPTC) require 
affected suppliers to conduct a reasonably comprehensive enquiry into the existence and origins 
of any 3TG in their respective supply chains, and to provide written evidence of due diligence by 
completing the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT), in line with Regulation (EU) 
2017/821 and subsequent amendments. The Company’s due diligence process and measures 
have been designed to conform, in all material respects, with the due diligence framework 
presented by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in its 
2016 publication Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals 
from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas8 (third edition, OECD Publishing), including its 
Supplements on gold, tin, tantalum, and tungsten. This due diligence framework is also known 
as the OECD Guidance.
We are committed to making every reasonable effort to establish, and require affected 
suppliers to disclose, whether the products purchased contain 3TG obtained from sources that 
fund armed conflict or support inhumane treatment in the DRC or other countries or areas 
considered at high risk of conflict7.
We have processes in place to record and act on concerns expressed by employees and others 
about possible improper or unethical business practices or violations of company policies 
(including our Code of Conduct, Supplier Code of Conduct, and Conflict Minerals Policy) or 
applicable laws. This grievance mechanism is described in our Conflict Minerals Policy.
Iveco Group implements globally recognised Compliance Data Exchange (CDX) software 
for conflict mineral management. We chose CDX because it interfaces directly with the 
International Material Data System  (IMDS) that we have used for years to manage 
Substances of Concern (SoC) in our vehicles. Through the CDX software, we are able to evaluate 
the conflict minerals report templates (CMRT) submitted by about 100 suppliers for a sample 
of products, and to automatically verify and file the subsequent reports. This setup also enables 
the suppliers’ direct involvement in a qualitative crosscheck analysis of CMRT templates against 
the chemical compositions stated in the respective Material Data Sheets (MDS). 
(8) See OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas 

Page 117:
Human and Labour Rights Management
SOCIAL
Our People Our Suppliers Our Dealership Our Customers Local Communities117
Of the suppliers requested to complete the CMRT in 2023, 90% did so as per OECD guidelines, 
and our Procurement Department will chase up the remainder. If the products sold to Iveco Group 
are found to contain 3TG, suppliers must identify their sources and discontinue procurement, as 
soon as commercially feasible, of those containing 3TG obtained from sources that fund or support 
inhumane treatment in the DRC or other countries or areas considered at high risk of conflict. We 
reserve the right to reassess future business dealings with suppliers that fail to comply with this 
policy. 
3.1.1.3 RESPONSIBLE USE OF COBALT
Cobalt is becoming an important material for Iveco Group, being a key element in the lithium-
ion rechargeable batteries used in electric vehicles that, as we know, play a significant role 
in reducing greenhouse gas and polluting emissions. Cobalt is also used in the production of 
magnetic, wear-resistant, and high-strength engineering alloys, properties that are all critical 
in efficient vehicle design. 
The world’s largest producer of cobalt is the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), holding 
more than 50% of global cobalt reserves. In recent years, annual cobalt consumption globally 
has trended upwards and is expected to rise significantly over the medium term. However, 
many reports have highlighted concerns over the social and environmental impacts of cobalt 
extraction, including the use of child labour and unsafe working conditions in artisanal cobalt 
mining operations.
Having previously benchmarked various companies’ best practices under our former corporate 
structure, in 2023 we surveyed key lithium-ion battery suppliers on their sourcing information 
in light of our plan to implement a wider due diligence process on the responsible sourcing of 
cobalt throughout our supply chain.
Furthermore, in light of the recently published EU Regulation 2023/1542 on batteries and 
waste batteries that introduced a new due diligence policy for several raw materials contained 
in batteries – cobalt, natural graphite, lithium, and nickel – we have readied ourselves to work 
with our supply chain and all other stakeholders to evaluate the social and environmental risks 
of using them. 
3.1.2 Human Rights Assessments
GRI 
412-1
Iveco Group monitors respect for human rights across its internal operations and throughout its 
supply chain and customer base by means of dedicated processes for each area, as described 
in the following sections.
3.1.2.1 INTERNAL OPERATIONS 
To monitor human rights across internal operations, we have set up a structured process that 
helps us to identify potential risk/non-compliance areas in need of further assessment and to 
implement mitigation measures accordingly, if needed. 
The initial self-assessment phase of this process, overseen by the HR Department in the 
country of reference, covers compliance with our Human Rights Policy and with international 
human rights standards. A second phase of on-site audits analyses any critical issues identified 
through the self-assessments, and then defines any remedial actions needed with a view to 
continuous improvement. 
The Company also conducts detailed human and labour rights risk assessments when acquiring 
significant new businesses, operations, and projects. Such assessments may be conducted 
during the relevant due diligence process and often with the assistance of specialised external 
law firms or other professional advisors.
3.1.2.1.1 Self-Assessments
To monitor respect for human rights within our internal operations9, each year the Company 
conducts an impact assessment survey that involves several countries selected in rotation so as 
to cover 100% of internal operations over the course of 3 years. The aim of the survey, which 
is based on self-assessment questionnaires filled out by Iveco Group’s HR country managers, is 
to identify and prevent any adverse corporate impacts on the following human rights aspects:
 • non-discrimination and the right to equal remuneration (also covering the rights of women, 
indigenous people, and migrants)
 • child labour and young workers
 • forced labour (including, among others, human trafficking)
 • harassment
 • freedom of association (including, among others, the right to collective bargaining)
 • occupational health and safety.
(9) Joint ventures in which Iveco Group holds at least a 51% interest are included in the perimeter.

The impact assessment also focuses on the promotion of local communities’ social and 
economic development based on their specific needs.

(a) Refers to the percentage of employees involved as at the respective year-end. 
In each of the past 2 years and in each geographic area evaluated, the assessment confirmed 
the presence of policies and controls designed to ensure respect for human rights, in line with 
local legal requirements, and did not identify any particular concerns or issues, including in 
relation to child or forced labour and freedom of association. The assessments complied with 
the requirements of Art. 17 and 18 of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, 
201110 (the Ruggie Framework).
Every year, we perform a specific assessment of the entire workforce focusing on the presence 
of child labour across Iveco Group’s legal entities and on the level of compliance with our 
Code of Conduct’s child labour principles. The survey conducted in 2023 on 100% of our total 
workforce11 confirmed that none of our legal entities employed individuals under the statutory 
minimum age for employment or apprenticeship set by local legislation. The survey also showed 
that no minor under the age of 18 employed by Iveco Group under a regular employment or 
apprenticeship contract was exposed to hazardous working conditions12.

Framework 2011.
(11) Survey conducted on the total workforce as at 31 October 2023.
(12) For the purposes of the assessment, hazardous working conditions include: work with dangerous machinery, equipment or tools; the 
manual handling or transport of heavy loads; exposure to hazardous substances, agents or processes; exposure to health-damaging 
temperatures, noise levels, or vibrations; and work under particularly difficult conditions (long hours or night shifts).
3.1.2.1.2 On-site Audits
As per our risk management and internal control process, the self-assessments filled out by 
our HR country managers regarding our performance in upholding human rights across our 
legal entities and internal operations may be verified by our Internal Audit Department through 
specific audit engagements, conducted either on-site or remotely (the latter when in-person 
audits are unnecessary or unsuitable). 
The areas posing a potential risk to human rights are identified based on the outcomes of the 
specific self-assessments, or those of the periodic Risk Assessment (RA) performed by Internal 
Audit. The RA entails examining and evaluating the risk associated with each of the Company’s 
auditable legal entities, units, functions, processes, and cross-functional projects or activities. It 
also considers significant risk information that may emerge from aligned assurance13 activities 
conducted with Iveco Group’s Senior Management and the relevant functions (Enterprise 
Risk Management - ERM; Compliance; Energy, Environment, Health and Safety - EEHS; and 
Sustainability). Additional risks to human rights may also be identified through complaints or 
whistleblowing reports received via the Compliance Helpline. On-site audits are then planned 
accordingly.
On-site audits entail verifying the accuracy and completeness of the information disclosed by 
Iveco Group’s HR country managers, reviewing any documents, and interviewing the managers 
of the areas under audit. A report is drawn up to keep track of all relevant information on 
human rights issues and of any improvement measures identified by the audits. The report 
is subsequently passed on to the relevant corporate functions, along with any mitigation 
measures required.
In 2023, our Internal Audit Department conducted a human rights compliance audit at our 
Bus plant in Vysoke Myto (Czech Republic) to verify the physical condition of its facilities and 
production lines. The audit confirmed that the plant adheres to the human rights principles 
outlined in our Code of Conduct and Human Rights Policy, as well as to local regulations. It also 
suggested the plant take the opportunity to renovate certain aging facilities to ensure excellent 
working conditions are maintained as well as to discourage workers from smoking in common 
areas near the welding shop and assembly line.

3.1.2.2 SUPPLIER EVALUATION
As regards suppliers, it is important to prevent or minimise any environmental or social 
impact arising from or related to the supply chain. To do so, Iveco Group assesses its suppliers 
on sustainability issues by means of sustainability self-assessments, risk assessments, and 
sustainability audits (see 3.3.3.2 Supplier Performance Monitoring   ), and implements a 
specific operational procedure to monitor their compliance and risks. In 2023, we identified 77 
suppliers worldwide as presenting potential risks according to the following criteria: supplier 
turnover, risk associated with the supplier’s country of operation, supplier financial risk, level 
of participation in the assessment process, and risk associated with the specific purchasing 
category. These suppliers were subsequently audited by independent third-party auditors. Issues 
were identified for 11 of them, which agreed to a total of 15 corrective action plans for areas in 
need of improvement in terms of human rights issues.
The improvement measures identified included:
 • promotion of internal communication and engagement
 • facilitation of consultations and provision of up-to-date guidelines and operating 
instructions to all employees
 • formalisation of processes and/or procedures for managing the risk of child labour and 
human rights violations.
Action plans are then monitored via follow-up meetings between each supplier and the 
Company auditor. In the event of defaulting suppliers, further corrective actions are defined and 
implemented in agreement with the competent internal departments. 
According to the assessment process, in 2023 no suppliers were considered at risk in terms of 
child labour, forced/compulsory labour, or violation of either freedom of association or collective 
bargaining. To the Company’s knowledge, there is no use of child or forced labour at the plants 
of its suppliers.
3.1.2.3 CUSTOMERS
Before engaging in a commercial transaction with a customer, Iveco Group conducts a 
due diligence screening and risk assessment. Company names, shareholders, and owners 
are screened against a number of lists – issued, among others, by the UN, the EU, and the 
USA – intended to counter, among other things, human rights violations. As an additional 
measure, when appropriate, the Company ensures that its sales agreements include specific 
end-user contract clauses, or end-user statements and/or undertakings, for certain transactions 
or locations identified as posing a high risk in the risk assessment. In AMEA 14, Iveco Group 
introduced a more robust clause in its sales agreements that specifically refers to the obligation 
of all dealers and other third parties who distribute the Company’s products to comply with 
various human rights requirements when they resell Iveco Group’s products.

3.2 Our People
3.2.1 Context and culture
Our people are the engine that drives Iveco Group’s strategy and its ability to create and deliver 
long-term value. It is therefore a priority for us to accelerate their professional development, 
help them grow, and strengthen their leadership capabilities, improving individual performance 
through full engagement while ensuring a safe working environment. 
To attract and retain talent, it is critical to build and sustain a corporate culture of engagement 
and inclusion, combined with a willingness to promote and discuss this culture openly. For this 
reason, we believe in complete transparency when showing people how we do things, and have 
created an appealing employee value proposition (EVP) as a foundation for our sustainable 
evolution. 
Our Company is continually evolving to advance a sustainable society through growth, 
innovation, and highly engaged people. This requires a well-defined strategy, a purpose, and 
values in which engagement is the glue that holds everyone together, ensuring we are all 
moving in the same direction. 
Developing an inclusive and engaging work environment is part of our business strategy that 
we presented to investors in November 2021. Indeed, engagement, diversity, and inclusion are 
the foundations of our sustainable development and underpin the work we do on Company 
culture and human capital management.
Our commitment to our people is stated in our Code of Conduct, Human Rights Policy, and 
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Policy. The Code of Conduct and corporate policies were approved 
by the Board of Directors and distributed to all employees, and are available on our website 
and Intranet portal.
The highest responsibility for matters concerning our people lies with the Senior Leadership 
Team (SLT). From an operational point of view, the Chief Human Resources & IT Officer, who is 
also a member of the SLT, is responsible for the management of our people (including diversity, 
equity and inclusion, industrial relations, compensation and benefits, training and development, 
organisation, facilities, wellbeing, etc.).
Health and safety protection in the workplace, on the other hand, is promoted in every area 
and country of operation by a dedicated organisational structure (Energy, Environment, Health 
and Safety – EEHS), established within the scope of the Manufacturing function (see 3.2.5 
Occupational Health and Safety  ). 
In 2023, specific targets were included in the Performance Development Process (PDP) for most 
of the managers responsible for our people. Our commitment to our people is also reflected in 
the strategic sustainability targets incorporated into our Strategic Business Plan, to be achieved 
by year-end 2026: to ensure that 23% of management positions are held by women, and to 
reduce the employee injury frequency rate by 40% (compared to 2019). It should be noted that 
the first of these two targets was already achieved in 2023, and we have therefore changed 
its metrics and perimeter. Additionally, we have revised the second target, making it more 
challenging by expanding its perimeter (to include agency workers), and set a new target 
regarding gender pay equity. As a result, the updated strategic sustainability targets are: 
  to ensure that 30% of office positions are held by female office workers 15 by 
year-end 2028
  to reduce the injury frequency rate by 40% by year-end 2026 (compared to 
2019)
  to maintain gender pay equity16 across the organisation, and have it certified by 
a third party by year-end 2026.
Several grievance reporting mechanisms, such as the Compliance Helpline, are available to 
our people to report potential violations of corporate policies, the Code of Conduct, or other 
applicable laws.
(15) Office employees exclude hourly employees and Senior Leadership Team (SLT) members.
(16) Iveco Group assesses gaps in gender pay equity using multilinear regression. This analysis is performed in the countries of operation 
with a headcount of 100 or more.

Purpose and Values 3.2.1.1 VOICE: TRANSFORMING OUR CULTURE
As soon as Iveco Group was established in 2022, we wasted no time in embarking on our 
Voice cultural transformation journey – transformative in that it is as much a change in culture 
as in mindset, intended to go beyond corporate archetypes by giving voice to everyone within 
the Company when it comes to its growth and evolution. Our primary focus during this first 
stage of the journey was hence on engagement, acting on the principle that it is everyone’s 
responsibility. 
The first step in the Voice journey was to build Iveco Group’s identity and define its purpose and 
Values by listening to everyone in the Company. It was important to engage as many people as 
possible – our people first and foremost, as well as our customers and partners – using multiple 
means to reach them, including our first-ever Voice Engagement Survey (see 3.2.6.5 People 
Satisfaction and Engagement Surveys  ). This led to the definition of Iveco Group’s purpose, 
Values, and Behaviours.  
Using a bottom-up approach involving everyone within our Company, we defined our 5 
key Values, which were further translated into Behaviours. The use of ‘we’ emphasises the 
importance of adopting a collective approach in everything we do: 
 • We go beyond the obvious: this is about innovation, about taking the road less travelled, 
about being brave enough to explore and find unique solutions. It is what differentiates us 
from our competitors. 
 • We contribute diverse strengths: each of us is unique, and so is each of our brands. We 
come with a broad portfolio of strengths, and we work as a team to utilise them. 
 • We take ownership: we take responsibility and aim to achieve high quality results. 
 • We do what is right: this is about ethics and integrity, and about doing certain things 
simply because they are the right thing to do, such as promoting diversity. 
 • We collaborate to win: what we achieve together as a Company is greater than the sum 
of individual achievements.

SOCIAL
We also laid the foundations for a culture of continuous feedback, strongly promoting two-
way feedback by upskilling people across the Company and by creating opportunities and 
role modelling for it. Two-way feedback involves asking for feedback, giving feedback, holding 
meaningful conversations, and acting upon it. Being a two-way exchange, a focus area was 
upskilling our managers, required not only to provide feedback to those under their supervision, 
but also to request feedback on their own performance and areas for improvement.
2023 marked phase two of our Voice journey . Our main goal was to drive it forward, 
making it more structured and granular so as to deliver pragmatic solutions and anchor all of 
our processes to the purpose and Values identified. 
As a result, the journey’s primary focus in 2023 was on development  (see 3.2.6 People 
Development  ) and on connecting the dots to ensure that everything linked back to our new 
purpose and Values; this translated into a wealth of fully cohesive and consistent programmes 
and learning initiatives. From a culture perspective, it led to:
The corporate behaviours linked to our 5 key Values, are as 
follows:
Explore and enable new and better ways of doing things. 
Empower the unique qualities and contributions of each col -
league.
Take full responsibility for achieving high quality work.
Do what is right for our people, customers and communities.
And collaborate effectively to achieve exceptional collective 
outcomes.
 • the identification of a Leadership Framework (see 3.2.6.2 Talent Management and 
Succession Planning  ), which reflects what leadership means to Iveco Group
 • the updating of our talent review process to make it more human-centric, shifting from 
our former Performance Management system to our inclusive Performance Development 
Process (PDP)
 • the introduction of a Leadership Lab, delivering numerous learning and development 
materials and initiatives, accessible to everyone within the Company
 • the definition of a new employee value proposition (EVP), fully aligned with our purpose 
and Values.

3.2.2 Our Workforce in Detail
As at 31 December 2023, Iveco Group had 36,037 employees, an increase of 426 from the 
35,611 employees at year-end 2022. The change was mainly attributable to the difference 
between new hires (approximately 3,500) and departures (approximately 3,300) during the 
year. A further increase of approximately 200 employees was due to several changes in the 
scope of operations, mainly related to the insourcing of personnel from Stellantis (primarily 
from Custom Operations, HR, and Accounting Services), to the acquisition of the full and sole 
ownership of the former Nikola IVECO Europe joint venture in Germany, and to the sale of one 
dealer of property in France. 
Excluding the changes in the scope of operations, the workforce increase compared to year-
end 2022 was attributable mainly to the hiring of approximately 200 employees (salaried and 
above) in the research and development areas to strengthen the pool of skills and competencies 
for project activities focused on adopting innovative automotive technologies to advance 
technology transitions, particularly in the Light Commercial Vehicles, Bus, Electrification, Digital, 
and Electronics product lines.
Approximately 20 employees (salaried and above) were also hired in the Financial Services 
business unit to support GATE (Green & Advanced Transport Ecosystem), a new Iveco Group 
company managing long-term, all-inclusive rental models for electric trucks and vans, which 
will be a powerful component of the industry’s energy transition.
The increase in Europe in temporary and permanent workers in manufacturing due to growing 
production volumes driven by market demand, mainly in the Bus, Defence, Powertrain, and Truck 
business units, was offset by the manufacturing workforce reductions in Latin America.

And 3.4% in the rest of the world.
By age group, the new hires were as follows:
51.8% were in the 30 to 50 age group.
41% were under 30.
And 7.2% were over 50.
In 2023, there were approximately 3,300 departures from the Company, 21% of which were 
collective redundancies following the reorganisation or rationalisation of operations, in some 
instances initiated in previous years. Whenever possible, redundancies were managed through 
social welfare mechanisms provided for by law, and through social programmes established 
in collaboration with trade unions and aimed at minimising the impact on employees. In 
all, 21.2% of the collective redundancies were managed through voluntary resignations or 
employment contract termination by mutual consent with exit incentives at sites affected by 
collective dismissals; 19% were early terminations of fixed-term contracts; and 10.9% were 
employment contract terminations at the Company’s initiative, with payment of severance 
packages and other supporting measures more favourable than required by law, as per 
agreements with unions and/or employee representatives. The remaining redundancies were 
managed by applying the legal requirements, which were also implemented to determine the 
economic conditions for the affected employees.
The Company also provides opportunities for transfers between business units. During the year, 
151 Iveco Group employees transferred between legal entities within the same country, while 
36 transferred to a different country.
More details on turnover data are available in the Appendix  (see 4.3.3.1 Our Workforce in 
Numbers  ).
97% of the Company’s current employment agreements are permanent contracts, 98% of 
which are full-time. Temporary contracts represent 3% of all contracts. During the year, 1,200 
contracts were converted into permanent contracts, 27% of which with female employees. 
In Europe, there were 51 so-called non-guaranteed hours employees17, of whom 49 were male 
and 2 female. 
Temporary hiring takes place in response to a temporary need for personnel, in line with applicable 
laws and the provisions of collective labour agreements (CLAs). As at 31 December 2023, agency 
contracts accounted for around 3,100 of personnel. Most of these were hourly workers within the 
Manufacturing function. The number of hourly agency workers slightly increased in the first part of 
the year, but fell by 9% in the last part, partly due to the conversion of about 800 agency contracts 
into permanent employment contracts. This type of contract is entered into or renewed according 
to business needs, as per applicable legislation and CLA provisions, and is thus ultimately subject 
to variation in relation to specific market requirements.
There were also 3,305 contractors 18 throughout the year, providing general services such as 
canteen work, cleaning, waste management, and maintenance.
(17) Non-guaranteed hours employees are those not guaranteed a minimum or fixed number of working hours per day, week or month, 
but who may need to make themselves available for work as required (e.g., casual employees, employees with zero-hour contracts, 
on-call employees), as defined by the GRI Standards (GRI 2-7).
(18) This figure is expressed as full-time equivalent (FTE) and calculated based on total hours worked.

3.2.3 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
Iveco Group does not accept discrimination against employees in any form on the basis of: 
ethnicity, race, gender, sexual orientation, personal or social status, health, physical condition, 
disability, age, nationality, religious or personal beliefs, political opinion, or other protected 
status. The Code of Conduct states that harassment of any kind, such as racial or sexual 
harassment, bullying, or harassment related to other personal characteristics, which has 
the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of the person subjected to such harassment, is 
unacceptable within the Company – whether it takes place inside or outside the workplace. 
We are committed to complying with all applicable laws prohibiting intimidation, bullying, or 
harassment of any kind (sexual or otherwise). 
At Iveco Group, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) is not merely an initiative. It is integral to 
our strategy. It is what we do and how we do things, organically embedded in all our processes 
and decisions. We don’t work towards DEI because of compliance issues: we do it because it 
is the right thing to do, because it is one of our Values, and because it is what we believe in.
The responsibility for diversity, equity, and inclusion lies primarily with our Senior Leadership 
Team (SLT), led by our CEO, which is committed to creating a truly diverse and inclusive 
workplace where everyone benefits from equal opportunities based on their abilities and skills. 
We have also established a DEI Council to oversee and promote diversity, equity, and inclusion 
within the Company.
Within the Human Resources & IT function, the Talent Management Department is responsible 
for creating DEI programmes and initiatives and for promoting such a culture at all corporate 
levels in coordination with the HR heads of each business unit/function. This ensures that, 
in every aspect of the employment relationship – be it recruitment, training, compensation, 
promotion, or relocation – employees are treated based on their ability to meet the requirements 
of the job, and all decisions are free from any form of discrimination. 
Our DEI strategy was defined based on the following 6 key pillars, which identify the areas we 
will work on as a Company, using a bottom-up approach: 
 • awareness and communication, regarding how we manage our key messaging and 
storytelling 
 • career development programmes, which should be specifically tailored to employee 
diversity 
 • wellbeing at work, which entails reviewing both the policy and process for how we handle 
maternity and paternity leave, as well as introducing and aligning mental health support
 • the employee value proposition (EVP), encompassing how we attract, onboard, and retain 
diverse candidates 
 • gender pay gap, currently being audited by an external third party 
 • hiring and mobility processes, designed to counteract bias. 
We recruit and hire employees on the basis of their experience, knowledge, and skills, and 
are committed to providing equal opportunities to all, both on the job and in their career 
advancement, as stated in our Human Rights Policy available on the Company’s website and 
Intranet portal. 
Given our global presence, there may be differences in legislation among the countries where 
we operate, as well as different levels of awareness, concern, and ability among employees in 
applying the principles of non-discrimination. Our Code of Conduct and specific policies ensure 
that the same standards are applied worldwide. Indeed, as stated in the Code of Conduct itself, 
Company standards supersede in jurisdictions where legislation is more lenient. 
To further strengthen our DEI efforts and outcomes, a strategic sustainability target was 
incorporated into our Strategic Business Plan: 23% of management positions to be held by 
women by year-end 2026. This KPI was also included in the Company Bonus Plan to provide goal 
alignment and as an incentive to reach the 2026 objective. In 2023, we exceeded this target, as 
the percentage of management positions held by women at Iveco Group was 24%. We therefore 
revised it by changing its metrics and perimeter. The updated target is:   to ensure that 30% 
of office positions are held by female office workers19 by year-end 2028.
In line with our Voice cultural transformation journey, the big item on our agenda for 2023’s 
initiatives was inclusion. So, in addition to raising bias awareness, we put significant effort into 
creating an inclusive language. This led to the development of:

DIVERSITY EQUITY and INCLUSION MANIFESTO
Each of us is one of a kind.
We are unique people,
and we represent unique brands.
What unites us is our shared journey.
We go beyond, together.
We respect each other and everyone around us, 
fostering an open, supportive workplace,
listening to each other without bias,
valuing every perspective.
We are encouraged to be ourselves.
We contribute diverse strengths.
When everyone has the same opportunity,
the horizon shines brighter for all of us.
When we combine our unique qualities,
we spark creativity and innovation.
Together, we move faster, we travel further,
we climb higher.
Driving progress, beyond all boundaries,
Winning together.
To bring our manifesto to life through concrete action, we realised several initiatives in the DEI 
space – both at global and local level – to help reach our DEI targets. Some of these initiatives 
are described below.
We rolled out a global training initiative called The Hidden Biases of Good People that aims at 
creating awareness and reducing potential unconscious bias among our people. Offered via both 
online and classroom training in 7 languages, it was completed by over 3,200 managers in 2023.
We also implemented various local programmes20 aimed at attracting diverse candidates while 
raising awareness and improving understanding of inclusion topics. 
In partnership with the Siglo 21 University, we joined Siglo 21: Social & Labour Inclusion in Latin 
America, an initiative offering 3-month work opportunities at our Company to 18 people with 
cognitive disabilities, as part of the university’s Diploma in Competences for Social and Labour 
Inclusion.
In Spain, we took part in the Employment Fair for People with Disabilities, an event promoting 
the integration of professionals with disabilities.
In France, employees participated in DuoDay, an initiative that helps create work opportunities and 
supports people with disabilities.
Meanwhile, we confirmed our unwavering commitment to raising awareness of gender topics, and 
especially the pressing issue of violence against women, by taking part in several initiatives. 
One of these was our Red Bench project, during which we installed 28 benches at our various sites, 
with the keen participation of over 2,400 colleagues who helped paint them red, symbolising our 
dedication to raising awareness of violence against women. 
Furthermore, by collaborating with ActionAid in France, Italy, and Portugal, we will continue 
to provide our support in 2024 against gender inequalities and contribute to empowering 
and creating economic opportunities for all women, including marginalised and low-income 
women.
At a more detailed level, gender equity is a focal point for the Company. Women at Iveco Group 
constitute 19.1% of the global workforce. Female employees are mainly concentrated in the 30-50 
year age group, and in the group with a length of service of up to 5 years. More than 64% of the 
Company’s part-time employees are female, and 34.5% of temporary contracts are with women.
(20) Programmes were implemented in Spain, France, Brazil, Italy, the USA, the UK, Austria, Poland, China, South Africa, Argentina, and 
Australia.

In 2023, our female employees by professional category were as follows:
hourly: 49.9%.
salaried: 23.8%.

In 2023, our female employees by region were as follows:

11% in South America.
0.2% in North America.
And 3.7% in the rest of the world.
A survey monitoring the employment of people with disabilities is conducted every 2 years. 
The last such survey21 was carried out in 2022 in 13 countries (where the law requires companies 
to employ a minimum percentage of workers with disabilities), covering more than 90% of our 
global personnel. The survey showed that differently abled workers in these countries make 
up 5.3% of the total workforce. It also showed that differently abled women account for 
36% of the total surveyed. In all of our other countries of operation, there is no legislation 
establishing minimum quotas for the employment of people with disabilities, although in some 
cases other forms of protection exist (i.e., related to working hours or workplace environments).  
In these countries, there are objective limitations to reporting the number of differently abled 
workers, as the information is sensitive and often subject to data protection legislation.  
As a result, the Company is only aware of employees’ personal status if they choose to disclose it. 
(21) Survey carried out on 31 October 2022 in Austria, Brazil, China, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia, Spain, South 
Africa, Türkiye, and Ukraine.
During the year, we also carried out an employee nationality survey22 at Iveco Group legal 
entities in 7 countries, comprising 83% of our workforce worldwide. The survey evidenced that 
7% of employees were of a nationality other than the country surveyed. It should be noted 
that this percentage was higher for female employees (8%) than for male employees (6%). 
Germany, Italy, and Belgium were the countries where our legal entities employed the highest 
percentage of workers of a nationality other than that of the host country (14% in Germany, 
9% in Italy, and 8% in Belgium). For female workers, the figure was 14% in Germany, 13% in 
Belgium, and 11% in Italy.

CAREER DEVELOPMENT FOR WOMEN
During the year, we realised numerous initiatives aimed at supporting 
employees’ development and growth. For example, we launched the We 
Talk Series: Women Empowerment, featuring a number of 1-hour live talks given by women 
employees who shared their career stories and journeys to inspire their colleagues, exchange 
ideas, and build relationships through networking. In 2023, we partnered once again with 
the WINConference23, during which a group of our senior female employees from across 
Iveco Group attended a career development and networking programme aimed at inspiring 
leadership and bringing organisations together to share best practices. The partnership also 
saw both men and women from our Company involved in a number of events to raise 
awareness of gender equity topics and best practices. Mulheres Protagonistas, in Brazil, is a 
specific training programme for women at the start of their careers that aims to contribute to 
their development and professional growth. Themes covered include: women’s positioning 
in the labour market, professional values and objectives, and career plans. Lastly, the I-Talk 
initiative within our Truck business unit was launched to support female leadership and help 
women cope with bias against female leaders. At the heart of this initiative are women in 
senior positions sharing their stories with more junior female colleagues to inspire them and 
support their development.

3.2.4 Compensation
Iveco Group’s approach to compensation is based on equitable criteria to ensure that all 
employees benefit from an inclusive work environment and equal opportunities. Our Company 
is committed to providing a base salary that, in compliance with local regulations, is competitive 
with the local market, affordable from a business perspective, and in line with our achieve 
and earn philosophy. Our compensation approach comprises several different components, 
delivering a comprehensive package that rewards employees for their contribution to the 
Company’s results, allowing them to share in the business success they helped to create. 
Our base salary, benefits, and short- and long-term incentives are determined by market-driven 
benchmarks; this ensures that all our employees in the different markets around the world 
are treated fairly and objectively. The specific criteria for adjustments focus on closing gaps 
with respect to market position, giving priority to top performers. Variable compensation, on 
the other hand, is determined according to each employee’s individual contribution, which is 
assessed through a rigorous annual performance evaluation applied consistently throughout 
the entire Company to all eligible employees worldwide. Additionally, we employ a formal, 
monitored process to ensure our core equity and fairness principles are applied to compensation 
levels, annual salary reviews, and promotions alike. These reviews are in line with our reward 
philosophy. 
Thanks to the combination of the above measures, the Company’s overall compensation 
approach guarantees equal treatment for all individuals regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, 
religious belief, disability, sexual orientation, or other such factors or attributes.
3.2.4.1 EQUAL PAY
Recognising the importance of ensuring a fair approach to pay that is free from bias, we are 
committed to ensuring pay equity as a good business practice. This means equal pay for like 
work, for work of equal value, and for work rated as equivalent, regardless of an employee’s 
gender or other defining characteristics.
We also acknowledge the possibility of acceptable differences in pay for similar work, 
provided they are based on fair and objective criteria such as performance, education, or other 
measurable job-related characteristics. 
We uphold and maintain pay equity throughout the organisation by:
 • reviewing and adjusting pay ranges each year and ensuring their compliance with local 
statutory requirements, which vary by country and reflect the prevailing local market pay 
rates for the roles in question
 • monitoring the starting salaries of new employees to ensure they are fairly aligned with our 
pay ranges. To this end, before any employment offer is made, the HR team verifies that the 
salary being offered falls within predefined pay ranges (regardless of the candidate’s salary 
history), which reduces the likelihood of importing pay inequities from previous employers
 • monitoring salaries following internal promotions, with the HR team ensuring (as for new 
hires) that the starting salary for any promotion complies with local statutory requirements
 • consistently reviewing and adjusting pay ranges to ensure their continued relevance 
throughout the year.
We are committed to conducting an annual review of base salaries for nearly all employees 
in most of our countries of operation (around 99% of our workforce), and to using statistical 
analysis (specifically multilinear regression) to identify and promptly address any unexplained 
gender pay gaps. 
The analysis performed in 2023 revealed marginal differences in pay between genders, falling 
within an acceptable threshold of +/-5%. Regardless, our commitment to monitoring any 
unexplained gender pay gaps remains unchanged.
3.2.4.2 LOCAL MINIMUM WAGES
In many countries, minimum wage levels are established by law (although in some countries 
there may be regional, state or other internal variations). Where no specific law exists, a 
minimum wage may be established by collective bargaining agreements between employer 
associations and trade union representatives. This, for example, is the case in Italy, Germany, 
and Belgium, where pay and employment conditions are negotiated at regional or national 
level with the possibility of further agreements on their application or supplementary terms 
and conditions at company level. There are other instances in which minimum wage levels are 
established based on specific economic, social, and political circumstances and therefore do not 
allow for cross border comparisons.

201-3; 401-2
In 2023, we analysed a number of our countries of operation, representing 99% of our 
employees, to evaluate the adequacy of entry-level wages in each. In all countries involved, 
our entry-level wages 24 were at or above the statutory minimum, or the collective labour 
agreements, as shown in the following graph.
(24) In accordance with the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards), an entry-level wage is defined as the full-time wage in the lowest 
employment category, on the basis of Company practice, policy, or agreements between the Company and trade unions. Interns and apprentices are 
not considered. For each country, results are based on the sector with the lowest entry-level wage. Figures reported are as at 31 October 2023.
3.2.4.3 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
Benefits often make up a meaningful part of the employees’ total compensation package, 
with a value that goes beyond their salaries and cash incentives. For this reason, we offer 
a competitive range of benefits normally available to all full-time employees, and in many 
countries also to part-time or temporary employees. Benefits may differ according to an 
individual’s position and country of employment. 
We conducted a survey on 99% of our workforce worldwide, covering all our major sites as at 
31 October 2023, on the availability and adoption of various Company benefits (e.g., pension 
plans, supplemental health plans, financial support for those with accident-related permanent 
disabilities, life insurance, employee cafeterias or meal vouchers, etc.). Survey results are shown 
in the following table.

According to the survey, approximately 80% of our employees were eligible for a supplementary 
pension plan, and 67% of them had joined one (representing 54% of the total population 
surveyed). 
Supplementary pension plans fall into 2 categories: 
 • defined contribution pension plans, in which contributions (by the employee, the Company, 
or both) are defined at the outset, and benefits paid out depend on the total payments into 
the pension fund and the financial returns of the fund itself 
 • defined benefit pension plans, in which benefits paid out to employees are defined at the 
outset, while contributions may vary over time to guarantee the predefined benefit. 
Most existing pension plans at Iveco Group companies are defined contribution plans. 
In addition, nearly all our legal entities participate in supplemental health care plans , the 
majority being insurance-based. Levels of coverage vary by country, depending on the public 
health care system, tax and regulatory restrictions, and local market conditions. The survey 
showed that approximately 80% of our employees were also eligible for a supplemental health 
plan, and about 74% of the eligible workforce had joined one. 
During the year, we continued to promote a healthy lifestyle through wellness programmes (see 
3.2.7.1.1 Health and Wellbeing Initiatives   ) and by facilitating access to dedicated sports 
facilities.
3.2.5 Occupational Health 
and Safety 
Our occupational health and safety strategy leverages effective preventive and protective 
measures, implemented both collectively and individually, to minimise risk of injury in 
the workplace. We apply principles of industrial hygiene and ergonomics to our managing 
processes (at both organisational and operational level) to ensure optimal working conditions, 
and adopt the highest standards (even in the countries where regulatory requirements are less 
stringent), believing this to be the best way to achieve excellence. 
Under our safety management system, employees are integral to creating a culture of accident 
prevention and risk awareness, and are actively involved in identifying and reporting any actual 
or potential work-related hazards (e.g., by filling in specific forms). This proactive approach, 
combined with other tools such as training and awareness campaigns, allows us to share 
common, ethical occupational health and safety principles across the Company, and achieve 
improvement targets more effectively. 
In 2023, the Company delivered 189,272 hours of occupational health and safety training 
(of which 94,291 on the job). This included general training as well as training on specific 
work-related hazards (e.g., working at heights or in confined spaces, and safely handling and 
managing hazardous substances) and other topics (e.g., personal protective equipment, or PPE). 
The training’s aim is to raise awareness and reduce operational health and safety incidents. 
On-the-job training involved 21,854 employees (representing 60.6% of the total workforce), 
83.8% of whom were hourly. Specific refresher courses on safety rules and procedures are also 
delivered each year to contractors and agency workers.
We also require our suppliers and partners to comply with worker health and safety regulations, 
thus promoting high standards across the value chain to achieve continuous improvement. 
These principles are outlined in our Health and Safety Policy, adopted by the Company at its 
foundation, available in 7 languages to all employees and interested stakeholders via our 
website. The policy applies to all workers, including contractors and agency workers. 
We involve all employees and their representatives in the development, implementation, and 
evaluation of the occupational health and safety management system by: 
 • arranging periodic meetings 
 • consulting with them to identify hazards, assess risks, define controls and preventive measures, 
and analyse incidents (presenting any such items at the above-mentioned meetings)

 • engaging them in the development and revision of occupational health and safety 
objectives and policies 
 • collecting their feedback on the preventive measures adopted, on the organisation of 
the occupational health and safety management system, and on working methods and 
procedures. 
Safety is a priority across the Company, as evidenced by the compliance of our management 
systems with the ISO 45001 international standard (see 3.2.5.2 Certification Process  ). 
We use consolidated monitoring and reporting systems – such as the SPARC (Sustainability, 
Performance, Analysis, Reporting, and Compliance) system – to track health and safety 
performance, measure the effectiveness of actions taken to achieve targets, and plan new 
improvement initiatives, all through the management of appropriate key performance indicators 
(KPIs). These indicators can be analysed at different levels (plant, business unit, geographic area, 
or Company), thus enabling the simultaneous engagement of different corporate functions at 
various levels to meet the targets set. We also perform periodic benchmarking, which helps 
drive the continuous improvement of our plants’ health and safety performance. We have set 
ambitious annual targets for occupational health and safety, taking account of the particular 
work, experience, and technical advancement involved, while safeguarding employee health 
and the surrounding work environment. These targets, included in our Sustainability Plan, are 
pursued by implementing the continuous improvement processes of our safety management 
systems. Furthermore, a specific strategic sustainability target was included in our Strategic 
Business Plan:   to reduce the injury frequency rate by 40% by year-end 2026 
(compared to 2019). It should be noted that we revised this target in 2023, making it more 
challenging by expanding its perimeter (to include agency workers).
We consistently carry out health and safety hazard identification and risk assessments for both 
routine and non-routine activities at 100% of our plants, so as to establish specific action 
plans with quantified targets to address them. These action plans are prioritised based on 
risk assessment results, and the short-, medium-, and long-term countermeasures identified 
accordingly may include the modification or replacement of activities, materials, or processes, 
particularly regarding the design (or redesign) of work areas, processes, and work organisation. 
The effectiveness of these activities is verified via periodic internal audits and management 
reviews.
Risk assessments are conducted for normal, abnormal, and emergency conditions – as 
emergencies also require assessments and action plans to ensure they are dealt with promptly 
and effectively. 
In addition, newly acquired plants are assessed based on existing processes and activities, 
to determine what interventions are necessary to achieve health and safety management 
compliance with Iveco Group’s standards.
SAFETY IN E-VEHICLE PRODUCTION
We currently have at least 6 plants directly engaged in the manufacture 
of e-vehicles, with additional sites involved in their management. To 
provide expert support to all such plants and sites on the safe management of e-vehicles, 
in 2023 we launched a pilot project at our plant in Brescia (Italy) providing for an in-depth 
analysis of e-vehicle production and the subsequent development of risk assessment 
guidelines, operational and emergency procedures, technical countermeasures, and 
training programmes. This information was then circulated to other plants interested 
in e-vehicle production via our new EEHS Portal, designed for sharing documents, 
procedures, best practices, news, etc. with our global EEHS Community. The project was 
subsequently rolled out to the other plants involved in e-vehicle production.
3.2.5.1 RESPONSIBILITY AND ORGANISATION
We have established a consistent global organisational structure to safeguard and promote 
occupational health and safety in our activities across the countries in which we operate. 
Specific responsibilities in the fields of health and safety are defined in compliance with 
national regulations, and assigned by employers with clearly identified areas of accountability. 
Management at our plants and in the workplace rests with local employers. Employee health 
management (e.g., health monitoring, medical appointments, preventive consultations,

CERTIFIED PLANTS
vaccinations) is handled through in-house occupational medical services delivered by specially 
hired professionals, and through similar external services regulated by ad hoc consulting 
agreements. 
The highest responsibility for initiatives focusing on occupational health and safety at the 
Company lies with the Senior Leadership Team (SLT). 
Our central Energy, Environment, Health and Safety (EEHS) function (which serves as a reference 
point for sustainability) coordinates and manages health and safety issues as per Iveco Group’s 
Health and Safety Policy. It periodically verifies performance against targets, proposes new 
initiatives, and defines health and safety policies. Each plant’s EEHS unit is responsible for 
dealing with occupational health and safety issues, as well as for providing specialised technical 
assistance to production managers and to those in charge of other processes at site level. 
Moreover, each plant manager is responsible for implementing specific projects to manage the 
occupational health and safety impact of manufacturing processes. 
Lastly, our Board of Directors’ ESG Committee is regularly informed of health and safety results, 
and comments where appropriate. 
Individual health and safety targets were included in our Performance Development Process 
(PDP) for plant managers and for most of the managers responsible for the projects indicated 
in the 2023 Sustainability Plan.
3.2.5.2 CERTIFICATION PROCESS
The Company voluntarily certified its occupational health and safety management systems 
as per the ISO 45001 international standard, covering 22 Iveco Group manufacturing plants 
worldwide and accounting for 21,964 employees. Certifications are by accredited international 
bodies that are, in turn, continuously and rigorously monitored by other international 
organisations; they are issued following thorough checks, attesting to the high levels of 
reliability of our systems and effectiveness of our operational and procedural standards. 
In 2023, we certified our occupational health and safety management systems as per ISO 45001 
at some of our non-manufacturing sites, accounting for 3,865 employees at 8 different sites. 
This means that 30 Iveco Group sites worldwide (manufacturing and non-manufacturing) are 
now ISO 45001 compliant – covering 25,829 employees (about 72.2% of the employees within 
the reporting scope), as well as 2,694 contractors and 3,165 agency workers (representing, 
respectively, 81.5% and 93.7% of the relative populations within the reporting scope). All joint 
venture plants in which Iveco Group has at least a 51% interest are also ISO 45001 compliant.

3.2.5.3 SAFETY CULTURE
The Company’s Health and Safety Policy promotes individual participation through 
communication and awareness activities designed to stimulate and motivate our staff to 
play an active role in the overall improvement process. This approach is particularly important 
in a multinational and interdisciplinary environment involving many cultures, multiple legal 
frameworks, and large numbers of people.
In 2023, we implemented several initiatives to promote a culture of safety and shared standards 
across the Company, including training and awareness activities to create a safer workplace. 
A few examples follow. 
New global guidelines on safety training were distributed to all our plants worldwide. Going 
beyond local legal requirements, they provide for 4 stages that guide employees through 
theoretical training, practical on-the-job training, practice (application of acquired skills), and 
subsequent follow-up over a number of weeks in relation to safety at work. Targeted at new 
hires and at workers changing positions within the Company, these guidelines aim to ensure 
an effective health and safety induction process, so as to increase safety awareness and make 
safety rules and behaviours part of employees’ daily routine.
At local level, our plants in Brescia (Italy) and Bourbon-Lancy (France) both launched projects 
inspired by the first-hand account of a severely injured victim of a workplace accident (from an 
external company). 
Specific safety culture training was delivered in Argentina and Brazil to raise employee 
awareness of various non-manufacturing safety issues, such as the safe movement of vehicles 
and pedestrians. Still in Brazil, several health and safety campaigns – such as our Internal Week 
for the Environment and Accident Prevention (SIPAMA) – were organised to increase employee 
health and safety awareness and thus minimise the risk of injury and occupational illness in 
the workplace.

CARING ABOUT OUR PEOPLE’S  
HEALTH
Our people’s health and wellbeing is an absolute priority, and so we 
again launched several health initiatives during the year. In Italy, 
new software was introduced at all in-house medical facilities to manage employees’ 
medical check-ups. Developed by our central EEHS Department in collaboration with one 
of our suppliers and our occupational physicians, the software handles employee medical 
records and streamlines patient management. At our plant in Vysoke Myto (Czech 
Republic), the Health Week Programme saw specialists delivering talks on health, lifestyle, 
and psychohygiene, as well as other health initiatives such as eye tests, skin checks, blood 
pressure tests, and general health checks. At our plants in Sete Lagoas (Brazil), mental 
health specialists gave several lectures to plant employees on psychological wellbeing 
and suicide prevention. Further health initiatives included: educating employees about 
activities that may strain the spine, including cell phone use; online newsletters and 
guidelines to raise employee awareness of breast cancer and prostate cancer; and a 
questionnaire to monitor employees with chronic illnesses (diabetes, hypertension, 
cardiopathies, mental health issues, and osteo-skeletal conditions).
3.2.5.4 HEALTH AND SAFETY PERFORMANCE
3.2.5.4.1 Accident Rates
Accident rates are a clear indicator of how successful a company is at preventing occupational 
accidents. Owing to our many initiatives, the overall injury frequency rate in 2023 was 1.775 
injuries per 1,000,000 hours worked, a 26.7% drop compared to the result achieved the 
previous year. Safety data relates to approximately 99.8% of employees within the reporting 
scope25.
(25) The non-manufacturing data refers only to sites with a workforce of more than 30 people.

(a) The injury frequency rate is the number of injuries (work-related and non-work related, for employee and agency workers, resulting 
in at least 1 day of absence, excluding the day on which the event occurred) divided by the number of hours worked, multiplied by 
1,000,000.
 The base year (2019) injury frequency rate is equal to 2.758 injuries per 1,000,000 hours worked. For information on the rationale 
for choosing 2019 as the base year, see 4.2.2.1 Approach to Data Calculation  .
(b) The employee injury frequency rate is the number of employee injuries (work-related and non-work related, resulting in at least 1 day 
of absence, excluding the day on which the event occurred) divided by the number of hours worked, multiplied by 1,000,000.
(c) The rate of high-consequence work-related injuries is the number of such injuries reported divided by the number of hours worked, 
multiplied by 1,000,000.
(d)  The rate of recordable work-related injuries is the number of such injuries reported divided by the number of hours worked, multiplied 
by 1,000,000.
In the event of a work-related incident, a team is set up to conduct a field investigation 
and draw up a report to describe the event, analyse the root cause, and identify necessary 
countermeasures. During the follow-up, the team verifies the effectiveness of the 
countermeasures adopted, standardises them, and extends them to other areas subject to 
analogous risks to avoid any similar events in the future.

Calculation  .
In 2023, 725 near misses 26 were reported and analysed. The remedial actions deemed 
necessary and implemented thereafter led to enhanced preventive measures contributing to 
further improvement. In addition, to improve the management of events (such as injuries, 
incidents requiring first aid, and near misses), unsafe acts, and unsafe conditions, and to 
enhance the effectiveness of the preventive measures in place, several activities were carried out 
across the Company to develop and disseminate tools for collecting data on such occurrences 
and for analysing and tracking them.
An analysis of lost-time injuries highlighted that the main types of employee work-related 
injuries fell under one of the following 4 categories: fractures/dislocations/crushing; contusions/
bruises/abrasions; lacerations/punctures; and strains/sprains. For contractors, the main 
categories were: contusions/bruises/abrasions and fractures/dislocations/crushing. For agency 
workers, they were: contusions/bruises/abrasions and fractures/dislocations/crushing.
(26) Near miss: an unplanned event that did not result in injury, illness, or damage, but had the potential to do so.
As regards the Employee Occupational Illness Frequency Rate, the cases of recordable work-related ill health per 1,000,000 hours 
worked were as follows:
In 2023: 0.052.
in 2022: 0.073. 
and in 2021: 0.122.
The analysis also showed that around 80% of the injuries were due to unsafe acts and 20% 
to unsafe conditions. 
3.2.5.4.2 Occupational Diseases
Specific occupational disease indicators reflect a company’s success in ensuring a healthy work 
environment for its employees. Occupational diseases are the result of lengthy, gradual, and 
progressive exposures during work activities to chemical, physical or biological agents harmful 
to workers. 
We continually monitor occupational diseases in order to identify persistent working conditions 
that may have caused their onset, assess any residual risks and, if necessary, implement 
corrective and improvement measures to prevent recurrence.
In 2023, there were 3 cases of occupational disease involving employees ascertained by the 
relevant insurance authorities in the countries of reference, while there were no cases of 
occupational disease involving contractors or agency workers operating at Iveco Group facilities 
worldwide.
Hazards with the potential to cause occupational illness are determined through risk 
assessments at each site; ergonomics issues were identified as the main such hazard in 2023. 
For the measures adopted or underway to eliminate these hazards and minimise risks, see 
3.2.5.5.2 Workstation Ergonomics  .

3.2.5.5 SAFEGUARDING HEALTH
At Iveco Group, safeguarding employee health means more than reducing accidents and 
illnesses by identifying and eliminating hazards and minimising risks. In fact, we do our best to 
promote the psychological and physical wellbeing of our people through specific disease and 
disorder prevention programmes, backed up by assistance and support services (see 3.2.7.1.1 
Health and Wellbeing Initiatives  ). 
We also strive to ensure industry-leading working conditions in accordance with hygiene 
principles (including fully functioning WASH 27 services), industrial ergonomics, individual 
organisational and operational processes (including preventive measures for noise exposure), 
and protocols in response to pandemics such as COVID-19.
3.2.5.5.1 Work-Related Stress
We have implemented several initiatives to assess work-related stress, including the adoption of a 
structured risk analysis process focusing specifically on our health and safety data. This risk analysis 
is tailored to the specific nature, aspects, and characteristics of our Company’s workplace and 
environment, and complies with the specific regulations in each country of operation. Since risk 
assessments for work-related stress are influenced by environmental, cultural, and psychosocial 
factors, we have also developed a training programme for employees at all levels to ensure the 
objectivity of risk assessments within any given country. Consequently, assessment outcomes may 
differ from country to country. The systematic assessment of this type of risk helps us identify the 
most appropriate mitigation tools and promote employee wellbeing at all Company plants. The 
outcomes of this process are continually monitored to assess the effectiveness of the measures in 
place (e.g., through opinion surveys) and to implement new tools.
3.2.5.5.2 Workstation Ergonomics
We monitor workstation ergonomics at all plants across each geographic area, so as to prevent 
potential problems before they arise and identify and contain any critical situations. The 
probability and severity of an injury can be reduced by taking account of human physiology and 
of how people interact with equipment, right from the design phase of working environments.
To improve health, safety, and comfort, as well as employee performance, we make use of in-
house expertise to study workplace ergonomics, often through virtual simulations and often in 
close collaboration with eminent universities. 
(27) Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene. Acronym broadly adopted in the international development context and in the emergency sector with 
reference to access to adequate water supplies, sanitation facilities, and hygiene services.
The following are a few examples of the initiatives implemented in 2023 to improve ergonomics 
at various Iveco Group sites. At the plants in Valladolid (Spain) and Vysoke Myto (Czech 
Republic), ergonomics improvements were made in the paint shop to minimise excessive strain 
and postural load for plant workers. The Valladolid plant also adopted measures to reduce both 
exposure to chemicals and the risk of falls. In Cordoba (Argentina), several initiatives were 
launched to improve ergonomics in the workplace, facilitate parts handling, and eliminate or 
reduce repetitive movements and manual lifting for employees. Ergonomic workstations were 
also installed. In Sete Lagoas (Brazil), technical measures were introduced and the production 
process was modified to minimise risks related to the manual handling of parts, incorrect 
posture, and manual lifting.
ROAD SAFETY
Road safety awareness is vitally important both at and outside our 
plants. In Europe and South America, this issue was addressed through 
training, talks, and technical measures.
In Sete Lagoas  (Brazil), the Risk Perception  project delivered dynamic road safety 
training by simulating blind spots around industrial vehicles, so as to raise awareness 
among both drivers and pedestrians. During Road Safety Week, several talks were held 
with employees to alert them to the risks of not complying with road safety regulations; 
the focus was on road accident prevention, with car and motorcycle wrecks displayed 
at the plant entrance. Actors were also hired as part of our efforts to encourage safe 
behaviour and so help prevent road accidents.
In all, almost 2,000 employees were involved in our road safety and accident prevention 
initiatives throughout the year.

3.2.6 People Development
3.2.6.1 PERFORMANCE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
Our new Performance Development Process (PDP), launched in 2023, is based on a new 
concept: using dialogue for development and setting goals and objectives through both a 
top-down and bottom-up process. Our main goal was to ensure a talent assessment process 
where development is just as prominent as performance measurement, and where the overall 
assessment is more transparent. In other words, our mission was to make it more human-centric 
and to enhance engagement throughout the Company, since various studies have shown that 
this improves performance.
The new PDP introduces more review checkpoints between managers and employees 
throughout the year to provide frequent feedback on performance, customising the process 
to each individual. This involves continuous two-way feedback conversations – a development 
dialogue rather than just a performance one – focusing on goal achievement and adherence to 
Company-endorsed Behaviours as much as on each person’s aspirations, needs, and potential. 
To make the new system more inclusive, we decided to step away from our former numerical 
evaluation scale and adopt a word-based one, which we believe is more personal, more mindful 
of our people, and delivers a more positive message. Employees are evaluated not only on what 
they did, but also on how they did it, and the feedback provided is a means not only to motivate 
those involved but also to encourage open and positive relationships. 
The outcomes and areas identified for improvement are openly discussed between manager 
and employee, paving the way for employee performance improvement. Upon completion, 
employees can access their respective evaluations online. Furthermore, at any moment in the 
process, they can enter details on their professional aspirations and request specific training 
(such as coaching, exposure to senior management, etc.) to address the areas identified for 
improvement. This unique skills mapping and appraisal process is supported by IT systems that 
give managers full access to up-to-date information on the people within their organisational 
unit, and on those indirectly in their reporting line. Individual employee evaluations are therefore 
also accessible to and can be examined by senior management within the organisational 
structure. 
The main point is that our PDP provides a concerted, transparent, and above all individual-
focused management framework for employee development. 
During the year, 11,590 employees (salaried and above) were assessed via our PDP . The 
percentage of women engaged in the process was the same as the percentage of women 
employed by the Company. Furthermore, specific performance development (PD) training was 
delivered to managers and employees worldwide. 
Each employee is assessed through the PDP according to eligibility guidelines (for example, 
the employee must have worked at the Company for more than 3 months). Apart from a few 
exceptions where the PDP does not apply (for example, joint ventures in China), 100% of 
salaried-and-above employees worldwide take part in the process. 
In line with our achieve and earn philosophy, designed to promote a culture of excellence and 
rewards, PD assessment results are used to determine the individual contribution component 
of eligible employees’ variable compensation. This demonstrates the extent to which we value 
a results-driven culture and reward both achievements and behaviours.
In 2023, we set key sustainability targets related to our social, environmental, and climate 
change efforts (with the social ones also focusing on diversity, equity, and inclusion). These 
targets (the achievement of which affects variable compensation) were incorporated into the 
PDP , and duly assessed for relevant employees at different levels of the Company, including 
Sustainability project leaders, Energy managers, Environment, Health and Safety managers, and 
other staff at plant level.

3.2.6.2 TALENT MANAGEMENT AND SUCCESSION PLANNING
Universities, social media platforms, career events, and job fairs are a focal point of our 
recruiting efforts around the world. We support several universities, which affords us privileged 
relationships, a strong presence on campus, and regular student internships. In some cases, we 
directly sponsor individual postgraduate students to carry out research projects on Company 
premises. In others, we award university scholarships to students studying in areas where we 
intend to recruit. 
Iveco Group operates in a dynamic, highly competitive industry where success is achieved by 
identifying talented individuals within the Company, and by appointing the right people to key 
positions. These objectives are at the core of our recently introduced talent review process, 
through which we identify those with the potential to further grow within the organisation in 
order to fast-track and support their development. The talent review process was designed to 
reflect our cultural transformation, and in 2023 it was implemented uniformly across Company 
functions, business units, and levels. 
We started by defining our Leadership Framework, which articulates what leadership means 
at Iveco Group. It is built around 9 competencies and we are continually developing new 
learning modules to help our managers and leaders improve in each of them.

The Framework is applied consistently to ensure Company-wide alignment, providing a common 
language that everyone understands and that facilitates open discussion. Harnessing and 
implementing these competencies demands two-way communication and mutual exchange, 
which makes both leadership mechanisms and goals transparent and accessible to all. The 
Leadership Framework represents our way of stepping away from conventional models that 
see leadership as a closed box, in which leaders’ mindsets and opinions of colleagues remain 
inscrutable. This approach reflects our Values of collaboration, openness, and transparency. The 
Framework is used to identify people’s potential, strengths, and development areas.
People are first assessed by their managers, which is followed by discussions in talent roundtable 
meetings involving leadership teams at all levels to align and validate the assessment. These 
roundtables ensure that any decisions about our talents are made collectively, transparently, 
and objectively, which minimises bias and further supports our DEI commitment.
After talent validation, manager and employee engage in a two-way Dialogue for Development 
to ensure alignment with the Leadership Framework assessment, identify clear development 
areas, and define a development plan.
The individuals identified as talents are offered development opportunities (formal training 
combined with exposure to senior management and on-the-job training), which allow them 
to gain experience while enabling us to develop effective succession plans that give priority 
to candidates from within Iveco Group. Indeed, in 2023, 57% of open positions across the 
Company were filled by internal candidates28. 
More broadly, we deem it important to develop internal human resources. To this end, 41% 
of new manager level appointments in 2023 were internal candidates, the remaining 59% 
external hires.
In all countries of operation, we encourage the appointment of local managers. However, we 
may opt for international appointments if considered to be development opportunities for 
talented individuals, or to ensure that specific skills and expertise are transferred between 
countries. In that case, the appointed manager is required to invest in the selection and 
development of a local successor.

3.2.6.3 LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT
At Iveco Group, we believe that employee development is key to engagement and retention, 
both of which are crucial to our health, growth, and sustainability. That is why we leverage 
several forms of training to ensure employees can fulfil their potential, while allowing the 
Company to share its operational and business know-how, as well as its strategy and Values. 
In 2023, Iveco Group invested approximately €17 million 29 in learning and development 
initiatives at global level, demonstrating a strong commitment to the growth of our people at 
all levels.
This figure includes not only the pure cost of training under our ON LEARN learning 
management system (LMS), which was approximatively €0.9 million (see 3.2.6.3.4 Training in 
Numbers  ), but all other costs of people development initiatives, including those managed 
outside the ON LEARN LMS platform (including, but not limited to: training materials, MBA 
and masters programmes, coaching, and costs related to the design of customised learning 
journeys, particularly under the functional and technical academies).
In line with the human-centric approach of our Voice journey, we believe the development 
process is so much more than just training, involving areas such as coaching, mentoring, 
knowledge sharing and, above all, mutual exchange. For these reasons, we refer to it as a 
‘learning’ process in our development approach.

Our learning model is designed to enable a more effective and flexible response to evolving 
training needs arising from changes within the Company and in the economic environment. 
Indeed, our learning strategy is business-oriented, built around content areas such as: 
 • the fundamentals (soft skills, IT and software tools, language training, compliance)
 • the Leadership Lab (to build and strengthen the 9 competencies of the Leadership 
Framework)
 • technical, functional, and job-specific skills. 
All of the aforementioned learning opportunities are accessible to all employees and consistent 
throughout the Company.
Learning at Iveco Group entails a 4-step process: training needs identification, content development, 
programme delivery, and reporting. Ownership of each lies with different functions and business 
units, depending on which areas of content or expertise need to be improved. 
We manage our overall learning process through an internet-based global learning management 
system, known as the ON LEARN platform. It allows the most effective and comprehensive 
learning process for each employee to be defined and managed based on business, location, 
and/or specific individual needs, and builds upon our academies and training programmes 
specific to our business units and functions. 
Dialogue for Development (integrated into both the Performance Development Process and 
the Talent Review Process) is an opportunity for our people to reflect on their strengths and 
professional aspirations, discuss them with their managers, and together define the most 
appropriate development actions to support their personal growth during the year and 
beyond. Each development plan is therefore unique and requires employees to play an active 
role in identifying their needs, defining the most appropriate development actions, and taking 
responsibility for their own growth. Identified actions are then shared with respective Human 
Resources (HR), evaluated, and implemented according to needs and priorities. 
The role of the manager is to help ensure that individuals see how their aspirations, goals, and 
passions align with Company mission, goals, and strategies, and to support people in realising their 
potential.
Training effectiveness and efficiency are monitored and measured based on the participants’ 
satisfaction with the initiatives delivered and improvements in their knowledge/skills; in some 
cases, depending on the learning path, the Company also provides structured follow-ups. 
Our Talent Management Department facilitates the overall training process by providing support 
to other functions and across business units, focusing on the priorities that support our strategy. 
The Talent Management team centrally monitors: 
 • numbers of participants involved in training initiatives 
 • hours of training 
 • leadership development.
3.2.6.3.1 The Leadership Lab
The Leadership Lab, one of the pillars of our learning model, was created in 2023 as part of 
our cultural transformation journey to build and strengthen our people’s leadership skills at all 
Company levels.
The Leadership Lab contents are designed in line with our Leadership Framework, and currently 
include:
 • the Group Leadership Programme  (GLP): a learning journey for people identified as 
talents (see 3.2.6.4 Employee Development Programmes and Talent Retention  )
 • Leadership Essentials : a series of 9 courses, each covering a different Leadership 
Framework competency. The live, online or classroom-based sessions are available in 7 
languages to all office-based employees, regardless of their role or level. The contents 
of each have been designed to ensure consistency and alignment with our Values and 
culture. We launched 3 new courses in 2023: Decision Making & Accountability; Build 
Relationships & Network; Empower & Develop People
 • Moments That Matter : a set of resources (live or recorded webinars, manuals, other 
materials, etc.) to support managers in specific moments of the employee’s journey 
(Performance Development, Leadership Framework Assessment, Voice Dialogue & Action).
3.2.6.3.2 Functional Academies
The rapid pace of technological advancement makes it increasingly important to provide 
individuals with the right technical and job-specific skills to support our business strategies. 
Within this context, our Functional Academies play a crucial role in helping our people to 
acquire, enhance, and update their technical skills, essential for us to thrive and stay competitive.

COLLECTED THROUGH THE  
DOT PROGRAMME
In addition to the DOT programme, focused on the development of our plant employees, 
we have 5 functional academies: the Financial Services Academy, Finance Academy, IVECO 
Academy (covering IVECO products), Change Academy (targeted at our Truck business unit’s 
sales and marketing employees), and Technology & Digital Academy.
Both functional and technical training are managed through our global learning management 
system, known as the ON LEARN platform.
3.2.6.3.3 People Development through the DOT Programme
At Iveco Group, we apply the principles of our Driving Operations Together (DOT) programme, 
which promotes the integrated management of all aspects within an organisation. The DOT 
holistic model supports a culture of operational excellence across the Company and paves the way 
for a consistent and shared approach applied by everyone and aimed at best-in-class standards.  
As at 31 December 2023, 21 plants were participating in the programme, accounting for 99.7% 
of plant personnel worldwide and 100% of revenues from sales of products manufactured 
at Company plants 30. The DOT programme is designed to enrich our ecosystem with a new 
managerial focus that encourages a more proactive mindset. This is why our employees play a 
pivotal role in the programme, as reflected by one of its 11 commitments explicitly centred on 
people, recognising their essential role in our pursuit of excellence. The aim of this commitment is 
to shape the teams of the future through effective knowledge and skill development, while raising 
awareness of, and building a strong culture around, improvements in safety, sustainability, quality, 
products, processes, and logistics. It therefore helps us establish a robust competency development 
system within each plant, based on continuous skills gap analysis and evaluation, on the definition 
of targeted training to fill that gap, and on the development of appropriate learning paths.
The development of our people entails addressing some important challenges: 
 • zero accidents – creating a safety culture 
 • zero human errors – ensuring seamless interaction between people and systems, so as to 
improve process competencies 
 • developing outstanding technical professionals who can assess any facility’s current status, 
develop action plans to reach the desired status, and implement efficient and effective 
maintenance systems 
 • developing employees’ skills and competencies 
(30) The percentage is calculated on 22 plants; for the complete list of these plants, see 4.2.1.2 Data Coverage  .
 • achieving excellent process control through the correct implementation of quality 
procedures 
 • involving and motivating people to assume responsibilities within a continuous 
improvement environment.
Our leadership approach to managing employee engagement ensures that our people’s 
wellbeing and input are valued, driven by the belief that the more passionate and engaged 
people are, the more productive they are, and the more their suggestions are heard, the 
more they become involved and feel valued by the Company. Indeed, the DOT programme’s 
framework enables our people to share their contributions and suggest improvement projects 
(known as kaizen) to optimise processes, which boosts their engagement while contributing to 
the Company’s growth. Through their suggestions and the direct role they play in projects, our 
employees drive continuous improvement and contribute the most to it. 
The use of tools to share information and collect suggestions is well established at Iveco Group. 
In 2023, about 77,900 employee suggestions were collected across the plants where DOT 
principles are applied, with an average of 4 per employee. Furthermore, 2,062 DOT projects 
were implemented throughout the year, generating €34.6 million in savings.
ENGAGING PEOPLE THROUGH DOT
Our plant in Madrid (Spain), in collaboration with the Madrid 
Employment Agency, set up IVECO Lab , a training academy that 
provides theoretical and practical training directly at the plant, for a total of 100 hours per 
participant. The Lab creates a pool of candidates from which the Company can select new 
hires who are already trained and aligned with the plant’s quality and safety standards 
and practices, so reducing recruitment and learning times. Launched in October 2023, the 
first training courses involved 25 people, who obtained an average overall mark of 9.4/10 
in their final exam. The Madrid plant also launched DOTflix, an interactive web-based 
training platform, which was also used throughout the year to release training videos 
to increase awareness of the plant’s key performance indicators (KPIs) and of the impact 
that employees’ actions may have on achieving targets.

Our development strategy relies on a combination of both external experts from various fields 
to ensure that our people stay abreast of the latest technological developments, theories, and 
approaches, and in-house experts to enhance efficiency and consistently promote a culture of 
internal knowledge sharing and continuous learning.
In 2023, we were able to optimise cost effectiveness by scaling up existing programmes in which 
we had invested in previous years, making them accessible to more people without incurring 
additional expenses. Additionally, we provided courses to develop internal trainers who, in turn, 
teach other colleagues, thereby increasing training availability across the organisation.
As regards the training provided exclusively under our ON LEARN LMS platform (and covered 
by the circa €0.9 million investment), in 2023, Iveco Group delivered a total of 433,045 training 
hours to 24,996 employees, of whom 78.9% were men and 21.1% were women.

3.2.6.4 EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES AND TALENT 
RETENTION
Iveco Group firmly believes that a more skilled, engaged, and knowledgeable workforce is not 
only strongly correlated with improved performance, but also crucial to the sustainability of 
our business. 
Our development programmes are designed to foster a culture of continuous learning and 
growth; integral to our strategy, they empower our employees to acquire new skills, adapt to 
changing business environments, and make innovative contributions to achieving our goals. 
Moreover, our initiatives aim to promote a sense of belonging, while reducing turnover and 
increasing retention.
In 2023, as part of our Leadership Lab offer, we launched the Group Leadership Programme 
(GLP), a structured learning journey targeted at people within the Company identified as high-
potential talents. The programme explores the 3 dimensions of our Leadership Framework, 
providing our people with new tools, knowledge, and opportunities for networking, reflection, 
and interaction among colleagues from different departments and geographies. Spanning a 
5-month period, the GLP is structured into 4 workshops (2 webinars and 2 in-person sessions) 
and 3 action-learning moments during which participants are engaged in individual activities, 
group coaching, and peer coaching.
The programme’s main objectives are: 
 • to provide a better understanding of what leadership is at Iveco Group
 • to equip our leaders with the right mindset and tools to grow into strong leaders (based on 
the 9 competencies of the Leadership Framework)
 • to increase the engagement of participants, enabling them in turn to further engage their 
teams and further enhance their people’s development (which translates into business 
benefits in terms of productivity, innovation, and inclusion)
 • to build a network that can be leveraged to encourage further interaction and collaboration 
beyond the programme itself.
In 2023, 119 people participated in the Group Leadership Programme, divided into two cohorts 
(59 attended GLP1 and 60 attended GLP2).
3.2.6.4.1 Outplacement
The Company has specific programmes in place to manage career transitions, helping 
employees move on to new jobs and find their bearings in the job market. In some countries, 
we also offer outplacement services outsourced to carefully selected external partners. Based 
on specific needs, and at the Company’s discretion, outplacement services are also offered to 
managers.
3.2.6.5 PEOPLE SATISFACTION AND ENGAGEMENT SURVEYS
At Iveco Group, we use people satisfaction and engagement surveys not only for measuring 
the level of employee satisfaction and engagement, but also for identifying improvement 
opportunities that meet the needs and expectations of the entire Company. 
We also collect the information from exit surveys and/or interviews with departing employees 
worldwide. The goal is to understand what employees look for in a new organisation and 
gain awareness of any potential areas of dissatisfaction. Departing employees are asked to 
complete a questionnaire on management, career development, Company culture, and the 
work environment. The HR Department consolidates this data and shares specific business unit 
feedback with the relevant managers, in order to address specific matters of concern within 
each area.

Similarly, new hires are required to fill out questionnaires after 30 and 210 days of employment, 
providing valuable feedback on their first months at the Company.
In 2022, we embarked on our Voice cultural transformation programme, starting with a 
Voice Engagement Survey with very specific aims in mind. On the one hand, it was set up 
to measure and monitor our employees’ levels of engagement, addressing aspects such as 
job satisfaction, sense of purpose, clarity of expectations, and feeling of inclusion. After filling 
out the questionnaire, participants were asked to take part in the so-called Dialogue & Action 
sessions, held at each team level across the Company to discuss survey results and agree/follow 
up on specific actions for improvement. These sessions involved more than 1,800 teams.

On the other hand, the survey was also designed to find out what our own people think the 
Company’s purpose and Values should be. Like the overall cultural journey, it centres on a 
bottom-up approach by which we listen and give voice to the entire organisation, thus working 
from the inside out. Indeed, it was the first time we had involved everyone in a project of 
this kind. In line with our cultural transformation strategy, the Voice Engagement Survey is 
conducted on an annual basis. In 2023, it was sent out to approximately 35,000 people in 44 
countries, of whom 30,805 responded. 
ENGAGING OUR PEOPLE AT THE 
BOURBON-LANCY PLANT
Inspired by the results of our 2023 Voice Survey, our plant in Bourbon 
Lancy (France) launched two new, major engagement initiatives: a 
monthly plant magazine and its own buddy system, called Company Buddy, which pairs 
a new hire with a suitable and carefully chosen employee who serves as their guide. The 
monthly magazine is prepared by a working group at the plant with the aim of sharing 
the latter’s targets and challenges more effectively across all levels of the company, so 
further engaging our employees and empowering them to become even more central 
to our processes. The topics covered include: the month’s main news, the new XC13 
engine’s launch status, workplace safety, and the latest figures on production, product 
quality defects, safety, company headcount, and other HR topics. The Company Buddy 
system pairing an employee with a new arrival or intern, on the other hand, is all about 
structured meetings and activities designed to pass on useful information, practical 
advice, and other sometimes unspoken aspects of our corporate culture that so often 
help newcomers integrate more easily. The designated ‘buddies’ may have a different 
background and skill set to the newcomers, but will have gained sufficient experience at 
Iveco Group to excel as guides. The pairing is not based on a hierarchical relationship, but 
rather leverages the interpersonal skills of the two individuals involved, so as to ensure an 
ideal match and ultimately optimise an employee’s journey from the outset.

3.2.7 Welfare and Wellbeing
It is common practice at Iveco Group to offer our employees wellbeing initiatives in addition to 
traditional benefits (such as health care), going beyond our legal obligations in the countries 
where we operate. Time and money saving initiatives and flexible working arrangements help 
our people balance their personal commitments, while family initiatives, engagement with the 
community, and involvement in Company life cultivate employee motivation, pride, and a sense 
of belonging in the workplace.
3.2.7.1 WORK-LIFE BALANCE
At Iveco Group, we recognise that our people’s wellbeing is directly linked to how well they 
can balance their professional and personal commitments; for this reason, we offer several 
programmes and services to help employees meet these obligations. 
Childcare is an area where managing costs and time is crucial. We provide various types of 
assistance to our employees, including childcare nurseries, discounts at local day care centres, 
direct subsidies, school kits, and the flexible use of benefit funds for childcare expenses.
On-site services help our people make the best use of their time during working hours. In 
many locations, we offer on-site canteens, snack shops, and other meal services or vouchers. 
Additional types of assistance include: laundry and dry-cleaning services or discounts at certain 
locations in the USA, Switzerland, Italy, and Argentina; on-site banking and other financial 
services (including virtual workshops); and on-site fitness equipment available at some 
locations.
3.2.7.1.1 Health and Wellbeing Initiatives
Throughout the year, we engaged our people in many health programmes as well as awareness 
initiatives on health risks and preventive measures.
In support of new mothers, designated lactation/breastfeeding spaces ensuring hygiene and 
privacy continued to be made available at sites in Argentina, Brazil, Czech Republic, China, 
Switzerland, and the USA.

3.2.7.1.2 Flexible Working
At Iveco Group, we believe in improving employee wellbeing through flexible work arrangements, 
as permitted by local customs and regulations, by the organisational requirements in place, and 
by the job requirements of each position. By allowing flexible working hours, including part-
time employment, we help our employees reconcile work demands with family responsibilities, 
enabling them to manage their time to suit their needs (such as those related to childcare, care 
for the elderly, or other personal matters). These measures help us establish and maintain a 
positive working environment for all employees. 
In 2023, we carried out a survey on the flexible working arrangements we offer to our people, 
focusing on flexible working hours and parental and other forms of leave. The wide-ranging 
results helped us identify appropriate action for improving employee work-life balance. The 
survey revealed that approximately 94% of the employees surveyed31 made use of flextime. A 
separate survey32 showed that, between January and October 2023, 9,230 employees (about 
26% of Iveco Group’s total workforce) took leave to care for family members, for personal 
treatment and care (excluding all forms of compulsory leave for illness), or for study and 
sabbatical leave. 
Overall, 23.5 % of the above leaves (defined by Company policy or by agreements with trade 
unions or employee representatives) were more favourable than required by law, and 30% of 
the more favourable conditions were granted to female employees.
There are also some instances in which the Company grants paid personal or family leaves. 
This is the case in Germany and Poland (which represent 8.4% of the total workforce), where 
employees can take paid leave to care for a sick child. In Italy, France, Belgium, Poland, and 
Brazil (which represent 60% of the total workforce), employees are granted paid leave for 
weddings/civil unions and upon the death of a family member. 
In 2023, the type of leave most taken by employees was family-related (taken by 5,172 people, 
representing 56% of total leaves), with 17.8% of this taken by female workers. Leave taken for 
personal treatment and care amounted to 30.7% of the total, with about 34% of this taken by 
female workers. Education leave represented 12.8% of the total, 83.2% of which was taken by 
male workers. Sabbatical leave was 0.5%. 
(31) Survey of all Company employees, excluding hourlies, carried out on 31 October 2023.
(32) Survey of all Company employees carried out on 31 October 2023.
We believe such benefits help build a healthier, more motivated, and sustainable workforce that 
actively participates in the Company’s success.
In 2023, the following types of leave were taken by employees:
family care: 56%.
personal care: 30.7%. 
study: 12.8%.
and sabbatical: 0.5%.
During the year, we launched new initiatives across the Company and continued to expand 
a number of schemes that give our people the flexibility to work from different locations. The 
Work from Home scheme, which allows people to work from home for up to 12 days per month, 
has been further extended and is now available in 30 countries.
Meanwhile, 11,961 people globally befitted from a flexible work schedule that allows them to 
choose the time they clock in and out (within limits set by local policy). 
In Brazil, an hour bank allows employees to convert overtime hours into time off. They also 
receive an allowance for working from home, where applicable. 
In Italy, we offer the Venerdì Breve (Short Friday) scheme, in which people can vary the number 
of hours worked per day, provided they work their set contractual hours per week (e.g., 8.5 
hours from Monday to Thursday and 6 hours on Friday).

3.2.7.1.3 Parental Leave
The equal opportunities offered by Iveco Group with regards to maternity, paternity, and 
adoption are evidence of our commitment to encouraging both female and male employees 
to balance parental responsibilities with their careers. We grant parental leaves to all our 
employees in compliance with local regulations (labour law requirements may vary from country 
to country), collective labour agreements, and Company policies. 
In 2023, 1,671 employees 33, approximately 4.6% of Company personnel, took maternity, 
paternity, adoption, or breastfeeding leave. In terms of gender, 67.1% of overall leave was 
taken by male workers. Paternity leave accounted for 59.5% of the total, while maternity leave 
for 26.2%. Breastfeeding leave accounted for 14.3% and there were no adoption leaves. In 
France, Germany, Italy, and Spain (which represent 71.3% of total employees), our people are 
entitled to at least 11 weeks of paid maternity or paternity leave.
(33) Survey covering the period from 1 January to 31 October 2023.
In some cases, the conditions of parental leave granted by Iveco Group are more favourable 
than those required by law. In Argentina, for example, Company policy provides for 1 additional 
month of paid leave at the end of maternity leave, followed by 8 weeks of working from 
home to ease the transition back to on-site work. In the USA, due to their size, Iveco Group 
companies do not meet the requirements of the Family Medical Leave Act, which provides for 
up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for family or medical reasons; however, as per Company policy, 
employees are allowed up to 12 weeks of paid maternity leave. In the UK, by law, employees 
can take up to 2 weeks of paternity leave, paid at the relevant statutory rate or at 90% of their 
average weekly earnings (whichever is lower); however, our Company policy provides for the 
first 3 days to be paid in full, and the remaining days at statutory pay. In France, there is no 
statutory breastfeeding leave, the law stipulating an absence of 1 hour a day (30 minutes in the 
morning and 30 minutes in the afternoon); however, in accordance with a specific agreement 
between Iveco Group and the trade unions, our companies allow 8 weeks of breastfeeding 
leave, paid at 75% of the employee’s gross earnings.

3.2.7.2 SENSE OF BELONGING AND PRIDE
We have developed various initiatives to foster our employees’ sense of belonging and pride in 
the Company, such as volunteering, our Family Days, scholarship programmes for employees’ 
children, and sport events. 
To foster a sense of belonging, we also planned many activities worldwide especially for 
our people’s families. In December, the Iveco Group Industrial Village in Turin (Italy) was 
transformed into a winter circus hosting a children’s party, enjoyed by their families. Young 
children were met with gifts and festive surprises, games, activities, and entertainment. Festive 
holiday events were also held at many of our locations, bringing together our teams and 
families to celebrate our achievements and results, which is one of the ways we show our 
gratitude to our people and foster a sense of belonging. We organised Family Days in Argentina, 
Czech Republic, France, Italy, and India.
In 2023, about 5,200 people at various Iveco Group sites donated 24,987 hours to  
volunteering activities, with numerous initiatives realised to focus on helping people, society, 
and the environment. For instance, in response to the earthquake that struck Türkiye in February 
2023, our local employees volunteered to collect quilts, clothes, essential items, and food and 
deliver them to those affected by the natural disaster. A particularly impactful event was the 
Volunteering Day organised during our first Sustainability and DEI Week, which saw hundreds 
of employees work side-by-side with NGOs in various cities, including Bangkok (Thailand), 
Cordoba (Argentina), Istanbul (Türkiye), Madrid (Spain), Shanghai (China), Sete Lagoas (Brazil), 
Ulm (Germany), Vysoke Myto (Czech Republic), and Turin (Italy). The Volunteering Day held at 
our Italian headquarters helped raise funds for Rise Against Hunger, a non-profit movement to 
end hunger.
Through our long-standing grants and scholarship  programme – the Sergio Marchionne 
Student Achievement Awards – we offered our employees’ children a chance to qualify for 
grants based on their level of academic excellence. In 2023, around 180 pupils were awarded. 
We also focused on sport and recreational activities, which give our people an opportunity 
to network in addition to benefitting their health; in some cases, they also serve a broader social 
purpose. In 2023, around 2,000 people were involved in marathons, cycling races, and walks.
SUSTAINABILITY AND DEI WEEK
In June 2023, Iveco Group launched a new Company-wide initiative, 
its first Sustainability and Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) Week. We 
kicked off the event with a panel discussion among our CEO, our Chief Public Affairs & 
Sustainability Officer, our Chief HR & IT Officer, and the Chief Programs Officer of Rise 
Against Hunger. Every day thereafter saw different senior leaders hosting live streams 
and panel discussions to explore the 4 sustainability priorities that define our ESG 
strategy: carbon footprint, workplace and product safety, life cycle thinking, and inclusion 
and engagement. The Sustainability and DEI Week was also an opportunity to focus on 
Iveco Group’s efforts to build an increasingly inclusive workplace. A pivotal moment was 
the release of our DEI Manifesto and DEI Playbook, the latter providing tips, examples, 
and definitions to help foster a culture of inclusion. The week also featured numerous 
activities, including networking initiatives, training sessions, discussion groups, and an 
awareness campaign coinciding with Pride Month.

3.2.8 Industrial Relations
Iveco Group qualifies as an EU-scale group of undertakings, and is therefore subject to 
regulatory provisions designed to improve workers’ rights to information and consultation 
through the establishment of a European Works Council (EWC). Requests to begin negotiations 
on the establishment of an EWC were received by the Company from the trade unions in 
two different countries in July and October 2023, respectively. Procedures were subsequently 
initiated, in accordance with applicable legislation, for employee representatives to establish 
a Special Negotiating Body (SNB) responsible for negotiating with management on the 
establishment of the EWC and for determining, among others things: the scope of the EWC’s 
duties and powers, its size and composition, the powers and length of the EWC members’ 
mandate, and the information and consultation process.
3.2.8.1 FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION
As stated in the Iveco Group Code of Conduct, we recognise and respect the right of our 
employees to be represented by trade unions or other representatives established or appointed 
as per local applicable law. 
A survey on unionisation was carried out during the year (figures as at 31 October 2023) in 
most of the Company’s countries of operation, each of which has its own specific legislation 
regulating freedom of association. In certain countries, no surveys on the level of trade union 
representation can be conducted because an employee’s union membership is considered a 
private matter and, as such, is not communicated to the employer. 
At the time of the survey, 9 countries were excluded due to data privacy protection (accounting 
for 20% of Iveco Group employees), whilst 19 countries (accounting for 3% of the population 
mapped) had no employees affiliated with a trade union. 
It should be noted that the absence of employee affiliations with trade unions does not prevent 
employees from establishing representation bodies with information, consultation, and negotiation 
rights. This is the case in Romania and Poland, for instance, where around 220 Iveco Group employees 
(representing 20% of the workforce of the 19 countries with no employee affiliations to trade unions) 
elected such a representative body with information, consultation, and negotiation rights.
In 2023, employee Union Membership by country was as follows: 
ETHIOPIA: 78.3%.
CHINA: 77.5%.
ARGENTINA: 60.9%.
SPAIN: 60.1%.
ITALY: 41.2%.
CZECH REPUBLIC: 32.4%.
And BRAZIL: 0.4%.
3.2.8.1.1 Representative Bodies
Representative bodies, normally elected by workers at their respective plants, have the right to 
be informed and/or consulted and/or to enter negotiations on issues that, as defined by law 
or applicable collective agreements, may regard health and safety in the workplace, wages 
and benefits, operational issues (working hours, shifts, collective vacations, etc.), training, 
equal opportunities, company restructuring, collective redundancies, etc. In the countries of 
the European Union, the establishment of employee representative bodies is envisaged for 
companies and/or sites where employee numbers exceed the minimum limits specified by 
national laws or procedures.

A survey carried out on 31 October 2023 in all of Iveco Group’s countries of operation, involving 
99.9% of its global headcount, revealed the absence of any employee representative bodies in 
21 of those countries (accounting for approximately 3.7% of the workforce surveyed). 
Worldwide, more than 94% of our employees are covered by representative bodies.
3.2.8.1.2 Joint Committees
A survey34 conducted in October 2023 showed that 84.2% of Iveco Group employees worldwide 
were represented by occupational health and safety joint committees (i.e., committees made up 
of both Company and worker representatives). 
In Italy, for example, the health and safety joint committees at plant/site level are made up, on 
the workers’ side, of a number of selected employee health and safety representatives; and on 
the Company’s side, of the employer or representative, the Human Resources (HR) manager 
or representative, and the head of the Prevention and Protection Service. These health and 
safety joint committees convene at least once a month, and carry out the information and 
consultation duties required by Italian law. They also have specific rights to prior information 
and/or consultation as well as power of proposal, for instance in relation to: 
 • the implementation of health and safety programmes, initiatives, guidelines, and good 
practices defined by the Organo Paritetico Health and Safety 35 (OPHS), which was 
established according to the collective labour agreement (CLA) in force 
 • the proposal and evaluation of measures aimed at the ongoing improvement of health and 
safety in the workplace
 • the introduction of new technologies in the workplace – mainly of digital content (Industry 
4.0) and relating to the health and safety of workers 
 • the analysis and evaluation of workstation ergonomics according to the standards 
recognised and applied by Iveco Group, CNH Industrial, and Stellantis, as specified in a 
technical annex of the CLA. 
(34) Data based on a survey of 97.8 % of Iveco Group’s global headcount.
(35) Joint health and safety body.
Globally, joint committees addressing equal opportunities, training, and pay were found to 
represent 32.2%, 17.2%, and 7.3%, respectively, of the employees surveyed, while more than 
60% of them were represented by joint committees that deal with other issues. These include: 
 • several joint committees established in Italy under the CLA, such as the National 
Joint Committee, the National Joint Committee on Welfare, the National Equal 
Opportunity Joint Committee, and joint committees on organisation and production 
systems at plant and/or production department level 
 • joint committees for the management of apprenticeships and for social issues 
relating to individual workers, in place in various countries 
 • joint committees on housing, employee transportation, childcare, and cafeterias, in 
place in various countries.
In 2023, the distribution of joint committees was as follows:
occupational health & safety: 37%.
equal opportunities: 19.3%.
training: 8.4%.
compensation: 4.6%.
other: 30.7%.

3.2.8.2 COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS
As at 31 December 2023, collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) covered over 90% of 
Company employees 36. This is an average figure, the actual percentage depending on local 
practices and regulations, as shown in the following table. It should be noted that about 70% 
of the agreements reached in 2023 were signed with unions or employee representatives 
representing more than 50% of Company employees. Meanwhile, 4.1 % of the Iveco Group 
employees surveyed are located in countries where CBAs are unavailable; for almost 10% of 
this population, the Company determines employment terms and conditions based on the CBAs 
covering its other employees in other countries, or on the CBAs in force at other organisations.

3.2.8.3 COLLECTIVE LABOUR AGREEMENTS IN DETAIL
In 2023, Iveco Group signed a total of 133 collective labour agreements (CLAs) at either 
Company or plant level, 11 of which included provisions on health and safety matters. 
The following is a summary of the main wage and regulatory agreements signed during the 
year with Company legal entities: 
 • in France, agreements were reached in the last quarter of 2023 providing for wage 
increases as of early 2024 that take into account the loss of purchasing power suffered by 
the employees in 2023
 • in the Czech Republic, where an agreement had been reached in late 2022 on renewing 
the CLA for 2023 in consideration of rising inflation in the country (mainly due to the 
critical geopolitical situation), the 2024 negotiations were brought forward to the latter 
part of 2023 and are currently still under way
 • in Brazil, agreements were reached providing for a percentage pay increase similar to 
the average inflation rate, and for the alignment of benefits and working conditions with 
those applied across the country’s industrial sectors. Consensus was also reached on profit 
sharing agreements, providing for payments linked to the achievement of targets related 
to production and sales volumes, market share, quality, and absenteeism 
 • in Argentina, agreements were entered into on a quarterly basis to increase hourly 
employees’ wages to match the level of inflation. The signing of multiple agreements has 
been a standard and long-standing practice in South America, where hyperinflation is an 
issue. In fact, Argentina had one of the world’s highest inflation rates in 2023, surpassing 
200% – its highest in over three decades. An additional agreement was signed in March 
2023 on the applicable terms and conditions in the event of temporary layoffs for hourly 
employees, who will be entitled to receive 75% of their wages during any period of work 
suspension. A further agreement was entered into in November 2023, providing for the 
payment of a Holiday Bonus to the entire hourly workforce

COLLECTIVE LABOUR AGREEMENT 
RENEWAL IN ITALY
In March 2023, Iveco Group, Stellantis, CNH Industrial, and Ferrari 
signed a new collective labour agreement (CLA) with trade unions 
FIM-CISL, UILM-UIL, UGL Metalmeccanici, FISMIC, and AQCF-R. The regulatory provisions 
of the new CLA will be effective until 31 December 2026, while the economic terms will 
be effective until 31 December 2024.
The agreement, which applies to approximately 13,950 Iveco Group employees (not 
managers) in Italy, will also strengthen the Company’s relations with trade unions 
as it provides for the establishment of a National Observatory on Industrial and 
Organisational Policies made up of a representative from the National Secretariat for 
each of the signatory trade unions of the CLA and of representatives from the signatory 
companies. The Observatory’s objective is to share company information, particularly 
regarding production and employment trends, the implementation of strategic plans, 
related investments, and the ongoing industrial transformation, with a specific focus on 
the energy and green transition. The new CLA has several new provisions, including:
 • an increase in the contractual base salary as of March 2023, closely aligned with 
the 2022 average inflation rate, and a further 4.5% increase as of January 2024 
 • 2 lump sum payments (to be made in April and July 2023), and an additional €200 
as a flexible benefit to be used exclusively for the purchase of goods and services 
offered through a designated welfare platform
 • the application of the performance bonus introduced in 2022, with minor 
modifications 
 • additional provisions aimed at improving employee work-life balance
 • additional clauses aimed at balancing individual needs with the operational needs 
of the Company.
On 28 April 2023, an agreement was also reached with the relevant trade union regarding 
the renewal of the CLA applicable to all managers employed in Italy at Iveco Group, 
Stellantis, CNH Industrial, and Ferrari. This new agreement applies to approximately 350 
Iveco Group managers in Italy.

3.2.8.4 MINIMUM NOTICE PERIOD FOR OPERATIONAL CHANGES
In the European Union  (EU), the Council Directive 2001/23/EC stipulates that, should a 
contractual sale or merger result in the transfer of a business, plant, or parts thereof, an 
information and consultation procedure must be conducted with employee representatives. 
The procedure must be initiated a reasonable period of time prior to the transfer. Moreover, the 
Council Directive 98/59/EC, on the approximation of the laws of the EU member states relating to 
collective redundancies, requires employers to hold consultations with workers’ representatives 
whenever collective redundancies are being contemplated. Accordingly, Iveco Group subsidiaries 
comply with the regulatory provisions resulting from the adoption of the above directives in each 
individual EU member state. 
In Brazil, although bargaining is not mandatory in the event of a contractual sale or merger 
resulting in the transfer of a business, plant, or parts thereof, Iveco Group’s approach is to 
implement a direct and formal communication process with both employees and unions. Talks 
generally focus on minimising social impacts, if any. 
In Argentina, where the number of unionised workers is high, Iveco Group ensures frequent, 
in-depth dialogue with union representatives, and all Company initiatives involving operational 
changes (including dismissals) are discussed with unions in advance (even though this is not 
required by law). 
In both Brazil and Argentina , operational changes such as the deployment of new 
technologies to improve work efficiency, quality, competitiveness, or employee health and 
safety, are preceded by formal negotiations with labour unions, according to the specific 
terms and conditions of collective bargaining agreements. This negotiation procedure must be 
initiated a reasonable period of time prior to any change; when necessary, changes are made 
gradually so as to ensure employees are duly prepared. 
In the USA, the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN), which 
applies whether a site is unionised or not, requires employers with 100 or more full-time workers 
to give a minimum of 60 days’ notice for any action that will cause at least 50 employees at a 
single site to lose their jobs. 
In China, operational changes specifically covered by law (e.g., due to serious difficulties in 
production and/or business operations, the introduction of major technological innovations, or 
business model reviews) causing 20 or more employees, or 10% of the workforce, to lose their 
jobs, require a consultation either with unions or with the entire workforce; the Labour Bureau 
must be given 30 days’ notice of the workforce reduction plan. 
In Russia, the minimum notice period required in the event of operational changes is 2 months. 
The Company must also notify the local employment centre in advance if mass redundancies 
are planned. 
In South Africa, a 60-day consultation period is required, followed by 30 days’ notice of any 
operational changes.
3.2.8.5 RESTRUCTURING AND REORGANISATION
Iveco Group’s best practice, in part derived from past experience under the corporate structure 
in place until 31 December 2021, is to make every effort to minimise the social impacts of any 
restructuring or reorganisation. In fact, this is also customary practice in all countries where 
the law requires consultations or negotiations with workers’ representatives or trade unions 
in the event of either. If permitted by the regulations in force 37, the Company minimises the 
social impacts of restructuring and reorganisation by adopting a series of measures, either 
individually or in combination, such as: retraining, internal mobility programmes, individual 
follow-up consultations with employees, reduced working hours, outplacement services, early 
retirement, and/or compensation more favourable than required by law.
In Italy, the dismissal process affecting the workers at the FPT Industrial plant in Pregnana 
Milanese, which started in the third quarter of 2019, was finalised at the end of April 2023 
through an agreement with the trade unions signed in the presence of representatives of the 
Lombardy Region. Of the 63 workers still employed in April 2023, 3 accepted relocation to Turin 
under conditions more favourable than required by law, while 60 were collectively dismissed. 
The collective dismissal agreement conditions also exceeded legal requirements, offering early 
retirement incentives for those meeting the retirement criteria within 2 years, and an incentive 
for other employees opting to leave. The incentives were higher for employees taking care of 
children or parents with disabilities, and higher still for workers with disabilities. 
(37) For example, early retirement is applicable only if provided for by the law of the country in question. Furthermore, unless supported 
by an adequate scheme formally recognised by the relevant public pension system, any solution mandating early retirement risks 
harming rather than helping employees.

SOCIAL
A 12-month outplacement was also envisaged by the agreement for all workers, excluding 
those on early retirement. The redundancies of the 240 workers still employed at year-end 
2020 were managed through an extended process developed within the framework of the 
tripartite dialogue involving regional and national institutions and trade unions. This process 
was executed under conditions more favourable than required by law: 35% of workers 
accepted relocation (with incentives) to another FPT Industrial or Iveco Group site; 17% took 
early retirement with incentives; 23% agreed to terminate the employment relationship; and 
25% were collectively dismissed, effective from 1 May 2023.The reorganisation plan at the 
FPT Industrial plant in Foggia (aimed at dealing with the labour surplus and at relaunching the 
site) started during the third quarter of 2021, with the implementation of a 24-month solidarity 
agreement as of August of that year. Due to the early completion of the site’s restructuring 
activities, aimed at changing the plant’s mission (from producing exclusively on-road engines 
to producing a mix of both on- and off-road engines, further expanding both the internal 
and external customer base), and to the increase in production volumes, it was possible to 
terminate the solidarity contract as of 24 February 2023, i.e., 6 months earlier than expected. 
The reorganisation did not involve the dismissal of any workers at the site.
In Germany, in December 2023, a reconciliation of interest agreement was reached with the 
Iveco Magirus AG works council, providing for the dismissal of a maximum of 10 workers at the 
Hildesheim site by year-end 2024, as part of a strategic restructuring aimed at increasing the 
profitability of the pre-owned vehicles business. The social plan to mitigate the impact of the 
redundancies will be negotiated in 2024.
In Brazil, 2023’s significant market contraction (of almost 50% compared to the previous 
year) required the implementation of a restructuring plan at the Sete Lagoas plant for both On-
Highway Brasil Ltda and FPT Industrial Brasil Ltda. Holiday entitlements were brought forward 
and employees choosing voluntary turnover were not replaced. Downsizing was carried out 
gradually, from January to September, at around 50 workers per month as production needs 
fell, for a total of about 470 dismissals (including about 130 temporary workers), satisfying 
all legal requirements, including in relation to the financial provisions to which the affected 
employees were entitled. In August, an agreement with the trade union was reached providing 
for flexibility measures aimed at mitigating social impacts whilst satisfying Company needs. 
The agreement provides for a new and more flexible hour bank, and allows Iveco Group to 
implement temporary layoffs if necessary – meaning it can suspend employee contracts as 
needed, with salaries partly paid by the government and partly by the Company. During the 
temporary layoff period (which can be between 2 and 5 months), the Company must provide 
professional qualification courses for the affected employees, who in turn must meet minimum 
course attendance requirements. The job positions are kept open for the employees in question 
during the temporary layoff period and for 90 days thereafter. About 240 employees were laid 
off in October and 800 in November and December. It is expected that about 800 employees 
will be recalled to work in mid-January 2024.
In Argentina, a restructuring plan was launched in late 2023 in response to early indications 
pointing to a notable fall in demand in 2024 for brands IVECO and FPT Industrial. Within this 
context, by year-end 2023, the employment contracts of about 120 permanent employees 
were terminated by mutual consent, with individually agreed incentives. As always, there were 
discussions with the trade union to minimise the impact of redundancies on company climate.
3.2.8.6 LABOUR UNREST
In France, the level of labour unrest in 2023 more than doubled compared to the previous 
year. Most of the strikes were related to external initiatives (impacting other companies as 
well), mainly in protest against the pension reform. Only 26.6% of strikes were initiated by our 
internal trade unions, primarily to oppose the pension reform and only minimally in relation to 
annual wage negotiations.
In Italy, the overall level of labour unrest in 2023 led to a 135% increase in hours lost due to 
strikes compared to the previous year. It should be noted that almost 80% of these strike hours 
were due to external factors unrelated to the Company (an increase compared to the 50% 
reported in 2022). 
In our other countries of operation, the overall levels of labour unrest during the year were 
either zero or negligible.

3.3 Our Suppliers 
3.3.1 Our Management Approach to the Supply Chain
In keeping with previous years, we continued to take a responsible approach to the management 
of our entire supply chain. From small local companies to large multinational organisations, we 
remained focused on forging relationships that go beyond commercial transactions, working 
hard to build long-lasting and mutually beneficial collaborations with eminent and qualified 
partners that share our Company’s principles. The way we see it, supply chain sustainability 
means strategically and effectively promoting a sense of shared responsibility beyond corporate 
boundaries. This means that, in addition to the established priorities at the heart of supply 
chain management – quality, price, and lead times – we are fundamentally committed to 
advocating socially and environmentally responsible practices across our entire supply chain, 
while spreading a culture of sustainability among those Company employees who work with 
our suppliers every day.
Relationships based on open dialogue and collaboration foster efficiency, quality, innovation 
and, above all, a shared commitment to achieving sustainability targets, creating undeniable 
mutual benefits for both Company and suppliers. Furthermore, all parties involved stand to gain 
from long-term relationships centred on the implementation and monitoring of high standards 
of sustainability, because this reduces potential risks, ensures continuity of supply, and improves 
overall sustainability along the entire supply chain, mitigating reputational risks that could 
affect the Company’s credibility.
Iveco Group’s purchases are managed by our Group Procurement and respective business 
unit Procurement teams within the Supply Chain function, which operates globally through 
dedicated structures, by product line and sourcing areas. These Procurement teams define 
strategies and guidelines to build and strengthen alliances with our suppliers, offering them 
stability and development opportunities by leveraging our broad product portfolio.
The highest responsibility for Iveco Group’s sustainability in supply chain management lies 
with our Senior Leadership Team (SLT). Meanwhile, a dedicated Governance, Performance, 
and Sustainability Management Team (established within the Supply Chain Leadership Team) 
is responsible for monitoring our suppliers’ compliance with the Supplier Code of Conduct 
and their sustainability assessment process. In 2023, supply chain sustainability targets were 
included in the Performance Development Process (PDP) for most managers involved in supply 
chain management. 
In conjunction with the Iveco Group Code of Conduct, our Supplier Code of Conduct provides 
a framework for responsible supply chain management. Available in 6 languages on the 
corporate website and via our Supplier Portal, it stipulates suppliers’ compliance with local 
legislation and their respect for:
LABOUR AND HUMAN RIGHTS

Human and Labour Rights Management Our People Our Suppliers Our Dealership Our Customers Local Communities
The Supplier Code of Conduct applies to our entire supply chain, and requires suppliers to work 
with Iveco Group to enforce the Code itself and to pass on its principles to their respective 
employees, subsidiaries, affiliates, and subcontractors. To ensure the consistent alignment of our 
supply chain and purchasing practices with the Supplier Code of Conduct, suppliers undergo 
an Ethical Check every 3 years. This assessment is conducted by an external third party, using 
a dedicated reporting system that allows us to monitor any potential issues that may require 
further clarification or investigation. This periodic monitoring is regulated by Company policies 
and procedures designed to ensure supplier compliance.
In 2023, a training module on Iveco Group’s Supplier Code of Conduct was developed and 
delivered to both our supplier base and our employees.
All suppliers must comply with applicable laws (including, but not limited to, anti-corruption 
and antitrust regulations) and with our Supplier Code of Conduct, and are obliged to report any 
suspected violations thereof to the Company. To this end, they have access to an operational 
grievance mechanism, the Compliance Helpline (details of which are available in the Supplier 
Code of Conduct), to report potential violations of corporate policies, the Code of Conduct, 
or applicable laws. Any violations by suppliers may result in the termination of the business 
relationship with Iveco Group.
Two strategic sustainability targets for our suppliers were incorporated into our Strategic 
Business Plan: 
   100% of Tier 1 suppliers to be involved in sustainability self-assessment by 
year-end 2026
   a 100% increase in the number of collaboration projects with suppliers to 
improve products’ sustainability performance by year-end 2026 (compared to 
2021).
3.3.2 Supplier Profile
Iveco Group manages purchases worth almost €10.4 billion, with a total network of 1,926 
direct material suppliers. In 2023, 19 new eligible suppliers were added to our network, while 
there were no significant changes to supply chain structure and no additional outsourcing 
of activities. Our top 150 suppliers are considered strategic suppliers, not only because 
they generate 79% of the total value of purchases, but also because of the length of each 
relationship and the extent of each supplier’s production capacity and capability for handling 
spare parts.

In 2023, our total purchases by origin
were: 
Europe: 6.8 billion euros.
South America: 0.5 billion euros.
rest of the world: 0.3 billion euros.
The targets we have set ourselves include developing local skills, transferring our technical 
and managerial expertise, and strengthening local businesses. We strive to build strong long-
term relationships with local suppliers as this presents fewer risks associated with business 
operations and optimises costs.
Significant amounts are spent on local suppliers38: in 2023, the contracts signed with them by 
Iveco Group accounted for 97% of our procurement costs. Furthermore, 97% of these contracts 
were signed in Europe, which is our primary location of operation39.
(38) Local suppliers are those oper ating in the same country as the Iveco Group plant in question.
(39) T he significant locations of operation are defined by total direct material purchases. Europe represents our primary location of
operation as its direct material purchases account for 88% of the total value of our purchases.
In 2023, our total purchases by product type were: 
Vehicle dynamics: 26.6%.
Engines & after-treatment systems: 16.8%.
Steel: 17%.
Cabs: 15%.
Electrical & electronics: 14%.
Casting & machining: 9.6%.
Other: 1%.
Although we do not always purchase raw materials directly (one exception being steel used 
for direct processing), we constantly monitor their overall consumption and general price 
trends. In 2023, the main raw materials used in semi-finished goods purchased by the Company 
were steel and cast iron (including scrap), plastics and resins, rubber, and other miscellaneous 
materials (including PGMs 40 such as platinum, palladium, and rhodium, and high-voltage 
battery materials such as lithium, nickel, and cobalt).

(accounting for approximately 85.7% of direct material purchases) in the following categories:
 • casting and machining: 9%
 • cabs: 15%
 • electrical and electronics: 14%
 • engines and after-treatment systems: 19%
 • steel: 18%
 • vehicle dynamics: 24%
 • other: 1%.
Of the suppliers involved in the analysis, 94.3% were in Europe, 4.3% in South America, and 
1.4% in the Rest of the World. 
We recognise that the continuous monitoring of economic factors is essential to good supply 
chain management. The tool that we use for financial risk assessments (called TIGRAN, 
replacing our previous FS3 system) gives our supply chain managers access to the suppliers’ 
financial assessments. The tool is continually updated with confidential information provided 
by the suppliers themselves and with information contained in any financial reports. The results 
of this evaluation, which are generated automatically and checked by an analyst, allow us to 
classify suppliers according to their category of financial risk. Suppliers in particular difficulty 
are monitored weekly to prevent or minimise the risk of any interruptions to the supply chain.

3.3.3 Sustainability in Supplier 
Management 
3.3.3.1 SUPPLIER SELECTION
Considerable effort went into ensuring the full integration of environmental and social 
sustainability standards into our supplier management system. Selecting and codifying new 
suppliers is an operational phase of the procurement process that is regulated by specific 
internal procedures. Selection is based not only on the quality and competitiveness of supplier 
products and services, but also on supplier compliance with our Company’s social, ethical, and 
environmental principles.
New suppliers are required to sign a formal Commitment Declaration through which they 
agree to comply with both our Company’s Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct. 
Specific contractual clauses require them to provide references and demonstrate abilities in 
relation to: fighting corruption, safeguarding the environment, promoting health and safety 
at work, ensuring non-discrimination, prohibiting forced and/or child labour, and recognising 
employees’ freedom of association. Supplier agreements contain these and other clauses, as 
well as best practices and the General Purchasing Terms and Conditions, all of which are shared 
and applied consistently across Iveco Group. If a supplier fails to adhere to any of the above 
principles, the Company reserves the right to terminate the business relationship or instruct the 
supplier to implement a corrective action plan.
We evaluate a company’s potential to join our supply chain through the Potential Suppliers 
Assessment (PSA) process, which enables us to identify a supplier’s strengths and weaknesses 
and its ability to manufacture according to the highest quality standards using best practices; 
it also allows us to assess systems and processes directly at supplier plants. The PSA process 
is carried out not only to evaluate companies that do not currently provide direct materials 
to Iveco Group, but also suppliers that have undergone reorganisation or whose plants were 
relocated. PSAs are performed prior to the procurement phase to allow potential new suppliers 
to participate in tenders.
PSA criteria involve key sustainability aspects, with explicit reference to both environmental 
and occupational health and safety management. Indeed, one of the requirements is to have 
environmental and health and safety systems in working areas, preferably certified by a third 
party. A dedicated section of the PSA also allows verifying suppliers’ compliance with the 
restrictions on the use of hazardous substances. A suitable management system is a key factor 
in our decision to do business with suppliers, as it reflects their efforts to monitor and manage 
environmental aspects, labour practices, human rights, and their impacts on society.
In 2023, 19 new suppliers were evaluated according to the above criteria and added to 
our network. Supplier sustainability is then assessed regularly based on indicators included 
in a self-assessment questionnaire, with results verified by audit for a number of suppliers 
determined each year.

3.3.3.2 SUPPLIER PERFORMANCE MONITORING
We monitor our suppliers using a comprehensive dashboard that contains all relevant KPIs, 
organised in weighted, normalised clusters that are grouped into two categories: Performance 
and Reliability. These KPIs allow us to evaluate each supplier in terms of their quality, delivery 
behaviour, ESG performance, and business relevance.

(b) New business hold (measure taken due to serious issues with current supply, requiring significant and immediate change and improvement).
(c) Performance index quality (KPI directly linked to orders placed in the previous 6 months for a specific component from a specific supplier, normalised against correctly delivered volumes, serving as a measure of supplier reliability).
(d) Non-conforming parts per million.
(e) Supplier responsiveness on the Supplier Quality Portal (SQP). 
(f) Time to fix (time required to resolve a claim or field issue, serving as an indicator of supplier collaboration, proactiveness, and efficiency).
(g) Number of field issues associated with a supply from a given supplier.
(h) Production part approval process.
(i) Product improvement deployment.
(j) Supplier service level.
Monitoring all KPIs via a single dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of supplier 
performance, ultimately optimising our decision-making. The main risks we consider in our 
screening process for significant suppliers are sector- and commodity-specific. 
This centralised approach allows for the prompt identification of trends, potential issues 
across different sectors, and areas for improvement, enabling proactive management and 
the swift implementation of corrective measures where needed. It provides a clear picture of 
supplier efficiency, quality, sustainability, and reliability, all of which are crucial to maintaining 
operational effectiveness and prerequisites for suppliers to fulfil their contractual obligations, 
thereby mitigating risks and ensuring business continuity. The dashboard also allows us to 
compare supplier performance within the same material group; this comparative analysis 
provides valuable insight into each supplier’s strengths and weaknesses, contributing to the 
optimisation of our sourcing strategies.

3.3.3.3 SUPPLIER ESG ASSESSMENT
Undoubtedly, suppliers are central to supply continuity and can influence the way public opinion 
perceives Iveco Group’s social and environmental responsibility. We have therefore developed 
a process to assess suppliers on sustainability issues, which helps us prevent or minimise the 
environmental or social impact of our supply chain. This process is also a means to engage 
suppliers while promoting high sustainability standards and continuous improvement and 
development. 
To this end, we have also set up an email address exclusive to Iveco Group’s suppliers that is 
specifically dedicated to addressing sustainability matters, so as to enhance communication and 
ensure it is effective and transparent.
The supplier assessment process is performed yearly, managed by the Supply Chain Sustainability 
function and overseen by the Supply Chain Leadership Team. It involves 3 consecutive steps 
over a 1-year period. 
During the first step of the evaluation, suppliers are asked to fill out a sustainability self-
assessment questionnaire on Open-es, a digital platform designed to engage companies 
in a shared journey towards sustainability performance improvement. The platform is an 
interactive ecosystem in which Iveco Group serves as a Value Chain Partner, playing an active 
role together with its suppliers. All companies within this ecosystem collaborate and compete 
on sustainability matters with a sense of purpose, so as to create tangible, long-term value 
across the entire production chain.

Human and Labour Rights Management Our People Our Suppliers Our Dealership Our Customers Local Communities
In order to monitor the ESG performance of our suppliers, we ask them to register on the 
Open-es platform, access their ESG profile, and fill out the respective questionnaire. The latter 
is based on the 4 pillars of the non-financial sustainability reporting framework of the World 
Economic Forum, and its questions therefore regard People, Prosperity, Planet, and Principles of 
Governance. Each pillar covers several themes, grouped as follows:
PEOPLE:
This pillar covers dignity and equality.
human rights.
health and wellbeing.
skills for the future.
And employee wellbeing.
PROSPERITY:
This pillar covers employment.
wealth generation.
And innovation of better products and services.
PLANET:
This pillar covers climate change.
energy efficiency.
biodiversity.
water resources.
the circular economy.
And plastic recycling.
PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNANCE:
This last pillar covers governance models.
quality of governing body.
stakeholder engagement.
ethical behaviour.
risk and opportunity oversight.
And value chain management.
After the self-assessment, suppliers can access their ESG reports via the platform, along with 
suggestions regarding the implementation of corrective or improvement actions based on any 
gaps identified. Meanwhile, the data they entered into the Open-es platform allows Iveco Group 
to screen them on sustainability topics. To support our suppliers’ continuous improvement 
and development, Open-es also offers in-depth technical support programmes to build their 
capacity and improve their ESG performance, as well as validation, auditing, comparison/ESG 
benchmarks, and consultancy services. 
The outcomes of the self-assessment questionnaires are then analysed and used in-house to 
perform a sustainability risk assessment, which enables the identification of critical suppliers 
whose compliance with sustainability requirements needs to be addressed. These suppliers are 
identified based on specific criteria, such as whether or not they have disclosed their Open-es 
ESG score and relevant evaluation with Iveco Group.
Based on risk assessment outcomes, suppliers are selected for additional actions, follow-ups, and/or 
auditing. These sustainability audits are organised in agreement with the suppliers, and performed 
on site at their plants by independent third-party auditors. The aim is to check the information 
submitted via the self-assessment questionnaires and define possible improvement plans where 
necessary. In 2023, the sustainability audits were performed throughout the second half of the year. 
Each supplier selects a manager and other representatives within its organisation (usually from 
Human Resources, Safety, Environment, and Quality) to take part in the audits. Should these reveal 
critical issues to be addressed, joint action plans are drawn up with the suppliers to define:
 • improvement areas (e.g., implementation of internal procedures in line with sustainability 
principles)
 • responsibilities (which could entail organisational changes)
 • corrective measures (e.g., targeted training programmes)
 • timeframes for action plans.
Action plans are then monitored via follow-ups between supplier and auditor, under the 
supervision of our Supply Chain Sustainability function. At the end of the follow-up period, 
action plan results are collected and analysed for compliance according to a dedicated 
operational procedure. In the event of defaulting suppliers, further corrective actions are 
defined and implemented in agreement with our relevant internal departments. Find out more

Sustainability performance, along with each supplier’s financial, technical, and logistics data, 
makes up the Summary by Plan document that we use to assign new orders. We also track 
Open-es memberships via the platform itself. The sustainability score is not a determining factor 
for supplier qualification as of yet; however, the Company will make it a mandatory prerequisite 
for new product sourcing by year-end 2024.
In 2023, we continued to invite our direct material suppliers to join the Open-es platform. The 
total suppliers currently registered on the platform are 749, representing approximately 82% of 
our direct material purchases. Moreover, their average progress so far in filling out the Open-es 
questionnaire (78%) is a clear reflection of their willingness to join us on our path and to share 
their progress with us.

3.3.3.4 ONGOING DIALOGUE WITH SUPPLIERS
We are firmly convinced that suppliers are key to our sustainable growth, which is why we 
do our best to keep them engaged and informed at all times. This continuous dialogue and 
exchange allows us to strengthen supplier relationships, providing fertile ground for shared 
goals and strategies and for thriving collaborations and joint projects – as evidenced by our 
many long-standing and mutually beneficial alliances.
The Supplier Portal represents the main collaboration and communication platform used by 
the Company to interact with its supply chain. It contains the forms, documents, and tools used 
to exchange information and manage any operations involving suppliers. 
In 2023, several initiatives promoting the exchange of ideas and information with suppliers 
continued as in previous years.
In May, we held our first-ever  Iveco Group Supplier Convention  in Turin (Italy), around the 
theme of ‘Connecting the dots’, during which we presented the Company, its challenges, and 
its strategic priorities. Above all, it gave us the opportunity to emphasise the importance of our 
supplier relationships, and their influence in generating synergies, support, and proactivity. The 
event, attended by almost 300 participants from around the world, sparked significant interest 
and debate during the Q&A session.
In July, we organised a Supplier Meeting in Belo Horizonte (Brazil) to share strategies and reinforce 
the alliance with our suppliers. On this occasion, the best performers out of the 84 attending 
companies were presented with awards in 5 categories for their contributions to: Customer Services; 
Technology and Innovation; Business Relationships; Quality; and ESG. We also hosted a dedicated 
event to showcase our ESG projects, inviting all suppliers from South America to participate in this 
category and share their own initiatives, which led to the registration and presentation of 29 projects.
In November, we invited our suppliers to our 1st Latin America Sustainability Meeting, held at our 
plant in Sete Lagoas (Brazil). Our Head of Sustainability presented Iveco Group’s sustainability 
strategy to the 56 attending companies, highlighting the importance of partnership projects to 
achieve a positive impact. It was also an opportunity to share the best practices implemented 
by the Company and other suppliers. 
Over the year, we also organised 7 webinars for our South American supplier base to promote 
continuous improvement and optimisation projects through the SuPer Programme, with the 
active participation of the companies that attended (resulting in over 200 ideas and proposals 
collected and evaluated).
We then organised 4 digital workshops around the Open-es platform for our supplier base 
worldwide, with two held for the onboarding of new suppliers and two to provide updates on 
the new features of the platform. On each occasion, we also provided information and training 
on our supplier ESG programme, processes, and requirements. The combined sessions involved 
more than 500 participants. We also launched a further onboarding campaign focused on 
the platform’s many useful functions and features, delivered via ad hoc communications, user 
manuals, and targeted meetings with suppliers. Encouraging Open-es platform membership 
is our primary initiative for increasing supplier engagement and awareness of sustainability 
matters. The platform’s approach revolves around creating a sense of community and providing 
a space where experiences can be shared. The opportunity for comparison with other industry 
companies makes suppliers more aware of their areas of strength and more mindful of any 
areas for improvement and any action priorities. 
We also promoted numerous initiatives to encourage innovation among suppliers, advocating a 
proactive approach to business. One of our key initiatives is to act on our suppliers’ suggestions: 
indeed, through the Suppliers’ Proposals section accessible via the Supplier Portal, suppliers 
can submit both cost reduction and quality improvement ideas, which are then assessed by a 
dedicated cross-functional team at Iveco Group.
3.3.3.5 COLLABORATION PROJECTS WITH SUPPLIERS
Much of our efforts in 2023 went into collecting and evaluating our suppliers’ improvement 
and sustainability ideas, which resulted in the selection and launch of 3 collaboration projects 
in the second half of the year, as described below.

Together with one of our major partners, we reengineered our remanufacturing process in 
Brazil, reducing its footprint by changing the way used parts are collected, and remanufactured 
ones are distributed. The project also centred on extending the life cycle of spare parts by giving 
new life to used components, thus reducing waste and encouraging resource reuse, which 
resulted in more than 600 spare parts remanufactured during the year. Besides its benefits from 
an environmental perspective, the project also had a positive impact in terms of our financial 
performance, commercial offering (given that remanufactured parts were not previously 
available on the Brazilian market), and carbon footprint.
We then partnered with one of our suppliers in a 2-year project providing for the setup of a 
brand new painting facility for FPT Industrial’s F1/F28 engines in Foggia (Italy), near the Brand’s 
plant. Leveraging FPT Industrial’s manufacturing background, we are sharing our sustainability 
and digitalisation expertise to assist in the online monitoring of the facility’s activities and 
resource consumption and in optimising its carbon footprint.
The third project was kicked off in the last quarter of the year with 2 leading bus tyre manufacturers. 
It provides for a series of dedicated workshops and follow-ups to advance development in material 
selection, sustainability, recyclability, life cycles, product offerings, and customer services. This 
collaborative project, which will continue in 2024, will specifically revolve around: 
 • tyre compounds, with a specific focus on performance and responsible material selection 
(especially for sensitive materials such as natural rubber)
 • customers, striving to meet their expectations in terms of tyre consumption, performance, 
fuel consumption, affordability, and sustainability
 • better products, which will add value to the overall customer experience without affecting 
costs (hence focusing on saving opportunities).
3.3.3.6 SPREADING AN INTERNAL CULTURE OF SUSTAINABILITY
In keeping with previous years, we continued to implement a number of well-established 
initiatives targeting the Iveco Group employees responsible for supplier relationships, i.e., 
those tasked with ensuring awareness of sustainability and good governance among suppliers 
through open and ongoing dialogue.
These initiatives included the development of a training module for supply chain employees 
(mainly buyers), focusing on their roles within the supplier ESG programme. The module, 
expected to be rolled out at the beginning of 2024, is also an opportunity to share and explore 
ESG matters while focusing on the role of procurement in achieving our strategic objectives.
3.3.3.7 SUPPORTING SUPPLIERS IN DIFFICULTY
In light of today’s global context, it is ever more important to closely monitor and manage any 
critical situations arising along the supply chain. To this end, we have further strengthened our 
structures and mechanisms for managing suppliers in financial difficulty, focusing on promptly 
identifying high-risk situations and on stabilising them through appropriate measures to ensure 
supply continuity. These measures include a recently implemented supplier monitoring tool.

Customer centricity is the fundamental driving principle behind Iveco Group’s strategy, guiding 
everything we do, and it is the dealer and service network that provides that crucial open 
line of communication with our customers. Dealerships are the first point of contact for those 
who use the Company’s products in their work, and who need advice on the best purchasing 
options and assurance that they are investing the right amount of capital, time, and resources 
in products that best meet their business needs. This relationship must be one of mutual trust, 
whereby customers can depend on prompt assistance and minimum downtime. This is why we 
invest in and work hard at continuously improving the customer experience (CX), redefining the 
customer journey as needed within each of our brands’ networks through targeted projects – 
such as the Retail Excellence Programme, aimed at improving the sales process, or the Digital 
Job Card initiative related to service delivery.
In Europe, our dealer and service network is made up of 249 Truck dealerships (of which 6% are 
owned by Iveco Group), employing more than 18,000 people, and 96 Bus dealerships. Globally, we 
have 468 Truck dealerships and 184 Bus dealerships. The network is responsible for implementing 
our specific dealership development programmes, which enable it to offer customers the best 
possible service, contributing in turn to its growth while making it stronger and more competitive. 
It must also meet the detailed Iveco Group qualitative standards specific to each brand, which 
are an integral part of the contract that each dealership signs when joining the Company’s dealer 
network. These standards are verified periodically and mainly cover:
 • dealer facilities and visual identity guidelines
 • sales processes
 • after-sales services
 • environmental impacts
 • safety measures
 • organisational structures
 • financial requirements
 • systems and tools
 • the training of dealership staff (salespeople, technicians, and managers)
 • e-mobility solutions.
For any non-compliance identified during audits, an action plan is established and monitored 
through follow-ups. Iveco Group representatives, who visit dealerships regularly, are responsible 
for communicating any changes in quality standards based on their area of competence, and 
for establishing a schedule for dealership compliance. Updates to quality standards are also 
provided during regular ad hoc events held to engage the dealer network’s sales force. For 
the above reasons, we always strongly encourage our dealers to pursue international quality 
standards, such as ISO 9001 for quality management systems and ISO 14001 for environmental 
management systems. Indeed, 85% of our dealers are certified as per ISO 9000 standards. 
New dealers receive guidelines on dealership facilities, appearance and visual identity, 
exterior and interior layouts, furnishings, posters, and staff uniforms. Detailed indications are 
also provided on all other aspects (sales, service, and spare parts) to help dealers to: define 
suitable outlet size, optimise internal flows, promote the right brand experience, acquire the 
required equipment (IT and special workshop tools), and ensure the appropriate headcount. 
The guidelines also specify the key performance indicators (KPIs) to be monitored for each line 
of business (response time in the event of downtime, and management procedures for Product 
Improvement Programmes). Additionally, they cover international best practices as well as the 
training requirements for dealership personnel, e.g., number of hours and types of courses 
that Iveco Group will provide for each professional. Our experts deliver induction training and 
support to new dealerships, giving guidance according to their areas of expertise on:
 • network development
 • sales
 • after-sales
 • financial services.
In addition, dealers may request the specific support of the Training function responsible for 
each respective market, and access many online profile-specific training courses made available 
by the Company.
In order to be admitted into the dealer and service network of one of our brands, candidate 
dealers must meet our recommended standards and have a business plan in place. Their 
processes are rigorously assessed for approval by Iveco Group’s Dealer Network manager, 
regional Sales VP , and Service, Parts, Financial Services, and Legal representatives, and their 
compliance is verified using ad hoc tools, with due diligence carried out by location and 

Page 168:

SOCIAL
Human and Labour Rights Management Our People Our Suppliers Our Dealership Our Customers Local Communities
by function through the Customer Master Data Workflow (CMDW) application. The overall 
assessment process is managed through an Electronic Network Action Approval Form (eNAAF).
Once the contract is signed, the dealer’s admission to our dealer and service network is coded, 
which entails the creation of a username and credentials to access our Dealer Portal. This web 
portal connects our global dealer network to Iveco Group, and provides the tools to manage 
sales and after-sales. The Dealer Portal allows dealers to:
 • configure a vehicle and draw up a quote for the customer
 • enter purchase orders
 • download Operator’s Manuals
 • register new vehicle warranties
 • order spare parts
 • obtain technical information and specialist assistance for repairs
 • receive authorisations to perform warranty repairs
 • receive information on Product Improvement Deployments (PIDs, or recall campaigns)
 • order documentation
 • receive promotional and marketing communications about spare parts
 • follow up on progress towards achieving spare parts sales targets
 • access documentation on the contractual quality standards.
3.4.1.1 CUSTOMER CENTRICITY
A crucial aspect of customer centricity is the dealerships’ level of expertise and proficiency 
at training end customers, and to this end we provide all of them with demos on vehicle 
functionality. Dealers are required to appoint demo drivers with expertise in driving efficiency 
and in the use of our connectivity services and programmes designed to improve driving 
styles. During vehicle handover, the dealers pass on this knowledge to customers, enabling 
them to optimise vehicle use and service life while reducing fuel consumption, so improving 
environmental sustainability and customers’ profitability. Furthermore, when collecting a new 
vehicle from the dealership, customers are also given a one-off training session on product 
safety features, which helps safeguard both the drivers and other road users.
3.4.1.2 QUALITY AUDITS AND INCENTIVES
The dealer network is audited yearly on qualitative standards, either by Iveco Group, external 
agencies, or the dealership itself through self-assessments. The audit checklist, which is based 
on the Company’s quality management system, covers 3 main areas – sales, after-sales, and 
spare parts – as well as specific aspects for each. Dealerships are evaluated on competitiveness, 
organisational structure, financial sustainability, customer service and satisfaction, visual 
identity, equipment and operations, administration and marketing, sales, spare parts, and 
participation in training.
The programmes implementing dealership qualitative standards , as well as all relevant 
information, are managed via the IVECO Dealer Network Assessment (IDNA) system, 
which enables dealers, sub-dealers, and authorised workshops to continually monitor their 
quality compliance while overseeing the measures in place to meet them. The system also 
collects information on every dealership audit performed, using the results to analyse dealer 
performance and, if necessary, develop action plans to help resolve any points of weakness 
detected. 
In Europe, in 2023, 4% of IVECO dealerships were audited by internal brand auditors and 96% 
by third parties, revealing that 85% of them are certified as per the ISO 9000 series of quality 
standards. 
Quality audit results determine dealership access to the respective incentive programmes 
implemented by each brand to reward dealer compliance. These programmes assess dealers and 
reward best-in-class performance across a wide range of operational and performance criteria. 
Developed in line with global market strategies, their main objective is to drive business growth 
and continuous improvement in quality standards to ensure outstanding customer service.
One of our incentive programmes is the Annual Dealer Performance Bonus, which sets priorities 
for dealerships and rewards those that excel in: 
 • customer experience (CX) management and customer satisfaction
 • use of customer relationship management (CRM) tools
 • improvement in sales and after-sales processes and services
 • expansion of maintenance and response (M&R) contracts and connectivity services to 
enhance predictive assistance.

3.4.1.2.1 Service Manual
Service Manuals provide our service network with information on the proper maintenance and 
repair of our products and components, and guidance on quickly and safely restoring vehicle 
functionality and efficiency on the first attempt. They contain data, specifications, instructions, 
and procedures arranged in the following sections:
 • mechanical procedures
 • descriptions of electric/electronic components
 • fault codes resolution and troubleshooting
 • descriptions of functions
 • schematics (hydraulic, electrical, and pneumatic)
 • tests, calibrations, and adjustments.
The manuals are intended for specialised, qualified personnel, provided they use suitable 
personal protection equipment (PPE), workshop equipment, and any special tools supplied 
by our brands. They are available in every major language used in the markets where the 
products are sold, and are accessible to the service network via a dedicated webpage on the 
Dealer Portal. The service network can also access and navigate an offline version of the Service 
Manuals using a tool known as eTIM GO, which also features live updates. 
With regard to its latest electric vehicles, IVECO is prioritising safety by providing its service 
network with: detailed information on specific procedures involving high voltage components; 
comprehensive checklists covering the entire workshop process (from acceptance and repair to 
delivery); and guidance on the proper management, return, and/or disposal of batteries.
3.4.1.3 DEALERSHIP TRAINING 
We believe it is essential to develop the skills and know-how of all our dealership personnel, which 
is why we created a training department to address dealer network training needs and enhance 
staff knowledge and expertise. We run special training programmes every year for approximately 
20,000 dealership personnel (technicians, salespeople, and after-sales staff), designed according 
to the strategies and needs of each business unit, brand, and geographic area.
Our training approach is to build on the dealer network’s expertise and ability to meet customer 
requirements, from tailoring product offerings to individual needs to performing timely repairs 
to minimise product downtime. We offer customised training courses and solutions consistent 
with current market conditions, plus a wide range of activities delivered, where possible, in the 
native languages of dealers and customers.
Courses are delivered in many forms, be it face-to-face at our training centres, via virtual 
classrooms (VCR), or via web-based training (WBT). WBT courses are delivered via our Web 
Academy platform, which maximises their time frame of availability and cuts costs by reducing 
the need to travel. Delivery methods are chosen by course users according to the certification 
level required. Coaching sessions by an expert trainer are also available for a deep dive into 
innovation and technology in our dealer processes.
Quality management training programmes are provided to 100% of our dealership network 
each year, and technical training courses to 100% of our authorised workshops. All technical 
courses feature specific sessions on safe product operation  and on environmental and 
climate change  issues. Additionally, we recently launched new High Voltage Certification 
courses for our workshop personnel to qualify them to work on electric vehicles. For our sales 
force, on the other hand, we provide specific modules on electric ecosystems and on how CO2 
emissions reduction targets contribute to fulfilling our climate pledge, with detailed information 
on the emissions of individual models during their use.
In 2023, about 30,000 Student Days were provided to our service network, with a 75% take-up 
rate (attendance was 45% web-based and 55% face-to-face).
As evidence of our commitment to transferring know-how to our dealerships, we have 
incorporated a strategic sustainability target into our Strategic Business Plan: to involve
  100% of dealership staff in safety training on our electric product portfolio by 
year-end 2026 (compared to 2021).
While general product safety aspects are covered by nearly all our courses, we believe that gas-, 
electric-, and hydrogen-powered products require specific safety training, given their particular 
features.
In 2023, we delivered safety training to 27% of our entire dealership, representing 80% of 
our primary dealer network and 10% of our secondary network, with participants attending 
in-person training on the new IVECO eDaily (the second module of a two-part course started 
the previous year). Dealers are required to provide a one-off safety induction or product safety 
session to all customers collecting a new vehicle, in line with the handover manual supplied 
by our IVECO Brand to the dealer network, which specifies each step for consigning vehicles. 
Since 2023, following the launch of the new IVECO eDaily, dealers are required to be certified 
in high-voltage safety to align with our Company’s safety guidelines and standards.

3.5 Our Customers
3.5.1 Lifelong Services 
Customers are always seeking to enhance their productivity and so need practical advice on the 
best purchasing options, how much to invest, and the right product for their business needs. With 
this in mind, our product distribution network is structured to suit customer priorities, while our 
brands’ websites help customers identify the most appropriate vehicles and equipment to buy.
A key factor in managing expectations is the effective handling of customer relations across the 
board, responding promptly and clearly and ensuring accessibility in the event of information 
requests and problem reporting. This aspect is also crucial for building long-term success 
because it helps determine the level of customer satisfaction. Furthermore, customer feedback 
and suggestions help us identify necessary changes to be made to existing product ranges, 
and new product lines to be developed to meet future market needs. We consider this aspect 
essential for building trust, while stakeholders view it as an opportunity to promote efficient 
equipment use and thus limit disruptions in the event of issues.
Commitment to our customers is a cornerstone of our Code of Conduct, which states that Iveco Group, 
and all its executives, managers, and employees, shall deliver the highest value to its customers. This 
includes making every effort to safeguard values such as confidentiality and personal data protection 
rights, in compliance with our Data Privacy Policy and with applicable laws.
Recognising that advertising must be truthful and transparent, we advocate positive and 
responsible values and conduct across all forms of communication. In this regard, in 2023, no 
significant final rulings41 were issued against Iveco Group for non-compliance with regulations 
or voluntary codes concerning: 
 • marketing communications, including advertising, promotions, and sponsorships
 • product and service information and labelling
 • breach of customer privacy and loss of customer data.
Each of our brands is responsible for managing its customer relations and establishing its own 
guidelines. Responsibility for delivering customer satisfaction lies with the business units, the 
presidents of which are members of the Senior Leadership Team (SLT).
(41) Significant final rulings are defined as having, individually, an adverse material effect on the Company.
When purchasing a product from Brand IVECO’s portfolio, customers want the opportunity to 
evaluate not only purchase prices, but also maintenance, depreciation, insurance, and operating 
costs. To this end, leveraging IVECO’s connected services, we have adopted a total cost of 
ownership (TCO) approach to assist customers seeking:
 • lower fuel consumption and CO2 emissions
 • longer scheduled maintenance intervals, fewer breakdowns, and improved efficiency
 • easier access to components for timelier interventions.
Through this approach, we are able to provide customers with an extremely valuable, easy-
to-use online calculation tool to aid them in selecting the vehicle best suited to their specific 
business needs. Our TCO model, developed by IVECO, has become more comprehensive 
over the years to take account of the Brand’s advanced connected services and increasingly 
customer-centric approach. In addition to covering aspects such as driver satisfaction and safety 
– providing specific KPIs to monitor driver behaviour, productivity, social responsibility, and 
economic and environmental sustainability – all factors within our latest TCO model revolve 
around the driver, and are integrated to continuously interact with and influence each other. 
The transport industry has recently had to face significant challenges, key among which is 
increasing capacity to keep pace with higher demand due to the lack of drivers – a consequence 
of newer generations being less willing to join the profession. Reasons cited are drivers’ working 
conditions and hours, road safety concerns, and legal issues – even human rights violations. 
In 2023, to better assess, understand, and tackle such challenges, Iveco Group joined the 
Responsible Trucking project, a collaborative platform launched by CSR Europe (a leading 
European business network for corporate sustainability and responsibility). The project enables 
companies to work together on evaluating the impact of their operations on logistics and to 
seek ideas for improving drivers’ working conditions.

The first step of the initiative involved our plants in Suzzara (Italy) and Valladolid (Spain), as 
well as 6 of our carriers. An anonymous survey was made available to all drivers via a QR code 
posted at the two plants and at our carriers’ premises. The questionnaire covered the following 
topics: respect for people’s rights (working hours, fair and equal pay, the right to join a trade 
union), the adequacy of employers’ training provision, and the quality and safety standards in 
our loading/unloading bays. Based on the initial wave of responses received from 149 of our 
plant drivers and 98 of our carrier drivers, we were able to identify our plants’ strengths and 
pinpoint areas for improvement, which will be addressed over the coming years. 
This project is a necessary step in achieving our strategic sustainability target incorporated into 
our Strategic Business Plan:    to collaborate with 100% of key partners to improve 
drivers’ working conditions and work-life balance by year-end 2026.
3.5.1.2 CUSTOMER-TAILORED MOBILITY SOLUTIONS
Brand IVECO offers a wealth of integrated services and solutions for the drivers of our vehicles, 
designed to help customers become more competitive, profitable, and sustainable while 
simplifying the management of their businesses. The flexibility of the Brand’s offering means 
that services can be customised based on specific business, job, and/or mission requirements 
– from connected telematics that exploit the vehicles’ full potential, to a complete series of 
tailored aftermarket solutions – so as to support customers every step of the way. Whether fleet 
managers or fleet owners, customers can choose the individual service packages that best suit 
their businesses (in terms of size and needs), and rest assured that costs are fixed and known. To 
ensure vehicles stay in top shape, our customers have full access to our synergistic service, spare 
parts, and dealership offering. Additionally, IVECO offers a broad portfolio of components, such 
as accessories and original and remanufactured spare parts, to help boost customer productivity 
while keeping maintenance costs in check throughout the vehicles’ service life.
Customers can count on Iveco Group’s Customer Uptime Centre, which provides support in 48 
countries across Europe and South Africa, in 34 languages, handling approximately 2.7 million 
contacts per year via the many channels available to our brands’ customers (phone, email, 
mobile apps, and websites).
Over time, the Customer Uptime Centre has expanded its approach to meeting customer needs, 
going from being simply reactive to issues and dealing with them when reported (e.g., via 
our Assistance Non-Stop service), to offering proactive and predictive services. Proactive 
support entails using telematics systems to detect vehicle issues, notifying customers, and 
promptly providing assistance and solutions; predictive support leverages fault code alerts to 
foresee potential issues, and notifies customers accordingly to avoid any unscheduled vehicle 
downtime.
Our Assistance Non-Stop (ANS) is a round-the-clock, 365 days a year service available to all 
Iveco Group customers in Europe and South America, providing immediate technical support 
for vehicle problems.
Upon identifying customer and vehicle location, the operator handling the assistance request 
pre-diagnoses the problem and, once the fault has been verified, contacts the nearest mechanic, 
who is directed to the breakdown location. The operator continues to monitor proceedings until 
the repair is complete, assisting the mechanic, if needed, and keeping the customer updated 
until the vehicle is released (be it on the roadside or at the workshop). 
The Customer Uptime Centre shares its database with relevant departments, listing faults by 
number, type, and breakdown duration and matching them with faulty models. The ANS service 
can be requested via a universal toll-free number or through the on-board infotainment system 
or the mobile apps designed for the drivers. In the event of a breakdown, the system serves as 
a gateway that enables the driver to send a breakdown assistance request directly from the 
vehicle to the Customer Uptime Centre, which in turn can send the driver regular updates on 
the status of the request and the estimated assistance arrival time.
For our IVECO S-WAY , IVECO Daily, and IVECO eDaily (each as of Model Year 2019), we have 
a Control Room that monitors and analyses the information received from the on-board 
telematics systems of all connected vehicles. This data provides information on vehicle status, 
and is processed using specific algorithms so as to identify potential malfunctions and intervene 
by promptly alerting customers before any serious issue or breakdown occurs. These innovative 
systems and real-time monitoring tools are currently used to monitor vehicle breakdowns 
across Europe. We collect and analyse customer feedback on the service they received via our 
new smartphone apps, and use the Net Promoter Score (NPS) to measure their satisfaction to 
better understand the overall customer experience.

Our Brand IVECO also offers fleet managers services such as fuel consumption monitoring, 
mission assignment and planning, route optimisation, and the monitoring of driving safety 
parameters. Furthermore, the on-board systems generate specific reports on fuel consumption, 
tyre pressure, and driving style, which help optimise vehicle performance and on-board safety. 
Lastly, through on-board and smartphone apps, customers have access to remote diagnostics 
services and international assistance.
IVECO has further strengthened its commitment to sustainability by launching new eMobility 
services for its IVECO eDaily customers. These services are designed to meet the increasing 
demand for environmentally friendly practices in transport and logistics. With features such as 
eRemote Control, eRange Assurance, eDaily Routing, and eCharge Management, the goal is to 
empower operators to enhance efficiency, maximise vehicle uptime, and streamline the charging 
process, ultimately contributing to the global transition to zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs).
3.5.1.2.1 Specially for Drivers
IVECO Driver Pal is a voice assistant specifically created to make the driver’s life even easier, 
more productive, and safer. This perfect travel companion is fully integrated with Amazon Alexa 
technology, enabling the use of voice commands from the smart cab to interact with the vehicle 
itself and with the driver community and to access IVECO’s connected services. Features include 
route navigation, vehicle status checks, and assistance to avoid delays and unplanned stops, 
thanks to traffic, weather, and other information accessed by voice command.
The IVECO Driver Pal assistant also helps maximise vehicle uptime: in the event of a breakdown 
or technical issue, drivers can request IVECO’s Assistance Non-Stop service by voice command 
instead of using their mobile app or infotainment system. Thanks to this voice companion, 
drivers can enjoy a safer driving experience with fewer distractions as all secondary tasks can be 
performed by voice command, leaving drivers free to focus on their missions. Any notifications 
from the Control Room, including those related to software updates, can be sent to the driver 
via IVECO Driver Pal (in addition to the IVECO Easy Way and IVECO Easy Daily apps). Moreover, 
with our premium service, drivers have access to fast tracking at workshops, accommodation in 
case of vehicle breakdown, and medical assistance in case of need.
3.5.1.3 SPARE PARTS DISTRIBUTION 
It is important for customers using Iveco Group products in their work to find spare parts as 
quickly as possible at their dealership workshops. Through our global network of 19 parts 
warehouses, we are able to offer dynamic logistics and assistance teams that work hard to 
deliver the highest quality standards and technology, ensuring the prompt availability and 
delivery of parts and the best solutions to any issues. We then work in partnership with selected 
suppliers to provide our dealers with the right combination of such services, parts, and solutions, 
so as to best support them in increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty.
The Company boasts around 400,000 items in stock: a complete range of new, used, and 
remanufactured parts, accessories, attachments, and telematics solutions that ensure all our 
brands’ current and past models deliver value and performance over the long term. Furthermore, 
all of our spare parts are packaged in brown, eco-friendly cardboard that is Forest Stewardship 
Council (FSC) certified, free of glossy paper, and made using a single ink colour – features that 
make packaging far easier to recycle.

3.5.2 Customer Satisfaction
Customer experience management (CXM) begins with the customer journey, which consists of 
a series of key touchpoints reflecting every interaction between customers and the Company 
before and after the purchase of Iveco Group products and services – from initial awareness 
to use, loyalty, and advocacy. Our CXM process is overseen by a central team, responsible for 
standardising the criteria and procedures for managing customer satisfaction while respecting 
specific business needs, and for ensuring that any reported issue is duly addressed by those 
responsible for the relevant touchpoints in the customer journey.
Within the scope of CXM, specific questionnaires enable us to measure customer satisfaction 
while providing valuable insights into areas for improvement. To better understand the overall 
customer experience, we also use the Net Promoter Score (NPS), which is the most commonly 
used approach for tracking and enhancing customer satisfaction due to its simplicity, scalability, 
and adaptability across industries. Its use of a single question – how likely a customer is to 
recommend a given brand or product to a friend or relative (on a scale of 0 to 10) – makes the 
NPS the most effective predictor of revenue growth. 
The NPS is the main indicator within our Brand IVECO’s CXM programme. Customer feedback is 
collected and circulated within the company as quickly, effectively, and widely as possible, along 
with the status of KPIs, to obtain a clear picture of customer satisfaction at all times. Beyond this, the 
CXM programme encourages customer inclusion and engagement, as the single NPS question elicits 
emotion-based customer assessments, indicative of their loyalty and sense of belonging to the Brand. 
Moreover, the feedback collected through the NPS survey is used to improve products and services, 
serving as a valuable tool for involving customers indirectly in the company’s decisional processes.
The importance of the NPS is underscored by the strategic sustainability target that we incorporated 
into our Strategic Business Plan in 2021 for IVECO Trucks, providing for a 20% increase in NPS by year-
end 2026 (compared to 2021). It should be noted that this target was already achieved in 2023, partly 
due to the implementation of a structured process for managing detractors42 within a specific time 
frame. We have therefore revised it and made it more challenging by increasing its level of ambition. 
(42) Detractors are survey respondents who give a company a score from 0-6 in an NPS survey (i.e., unsatisfied customers).  
As a result, the updated strategic sustainability target is    to achieve a 25% increase in 
NPS for IVECO Trucks by year-end 2026 (compared to 2021). 
In 2023, IVECO Brazil won its third Modern Customer Award, a prestigious recognition of top-
performing companies in Customer Experience, often referred to as the ‘Oscar’ for Brazilian 
services. This achievement is further acknowledgement of our investments in expanding our 
service portfolio and dealership network in Brazil, and a reflection of our commitment to 
delivering exceptional customer service.
3.5.2.1 OPERATOR’S MANUAL 
Each of our products comes with an Operator’s Manual (OM) containing key product information 
for customers, making it an integral part of the product itself. These manuals provide extensive 
details on safe product use and guidance to minimise environmental impacts, including proper 
disposal practices for lubricating oils and additives, and strategies to reduce fuel and energy 
consumption and pollution through efficient product use. 
Each manual contains comprehensive information on:
 • product identification data
 • product start-up and operation
 • correct vehicle manoeuvring
 • correct use of the vehicle equipment provided – e.g., fixed-body trucks, tail lifts
 • correct use of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) – e.g., lane departure warning 
systems (LDWS)
 • safe product use – to avoid risk of injury and/or of serious damage to the vehicle and to 
safeguard the environment
 • human-machine interaction (controls and devices)
 • on-board equipment
 • telematics features
 • technical features
 • periodic checks and scheduled maintenance
 • refuelling.

Human and Labour Rights Management Our People Our Suppliers Our Dealership Our Customers Local Communities
Manuals are available in every major language used in the markets where the products are sold, 
as per applicable local regulations, and are accessible to the service network via a dedicated 
webpage on the Dealer Portal. 
IVECO end-users can navigate the full contents of Operator’s Manuals by downloading the 
Brand’s Easy Guide smartphone app (for iOS and Android), which also features live updates and 
links to multimedia material. Meanwhile, with the introduction of the new Model Year 2024 
product ranges, the Brand is helping to reduce deforestation by offering shorter versions of the 
printed manuals, serving as quick guides on key safety and vehicle features. 
SUSTAINABLE EVENTS
When planning and executing Iveco Group corporate events, the 
Company takes meaningful steps to reduce its impact on the planet. 
In fact, whenever possible, it uses LED technology to reduce electricity consumption, 
replants the plants after using them as venue decoration, opts to support non-profit 
associations in lieu of traditional giveaways, limits the use of plastic by providing water 
in biodegradable and compostable bottles, and supplies shopping bags made mainly 
from recycled or recyclable materials. Iveco Group also limits the use of printed material 
as much as possible, or uses recycled and certified FSC paper, and any leftover food is 
donated to local associations that, in turn, distribute it to centres serving people in need.
3.5.3 Product Safety  
and Cybersecurity
As regards the manuals for its latest electric vehicles, IVECO has enhanced the contents on 
customer safety and on maintaining and safeguarding batteries to extend their lifespan.
The customers who purchase Iveco Group’s products use them every day in their work. To make 
their job as easy and safe as possible, we therefore incorporate ergonomics and comfort into all 
our product designs to provide increasingly intuitive and user-friendly controls. The Company 
delivers safe, secure, and high-quality vehicles by: researching, developing, and adopting 
ergonomic solutions as well as functional/technical solutions that help enhance product safety 
and security performance; conducting studies and research to find and develop safer and more 
sustainable materials and chemical compounds; and providing information on correct and safe 
product use via the Operator’s Manuals and through ad hoc training programmes. 
As stated in our Code of Conduct, ensuring product safety for our customers is one of our 
fundamental objectives and key responsibilities, which is why we make every effort to deliver 
extremely safe, reliable, and high-quality products and services. Moreover, everyone at Iveco Group 
is expected to comply with the safety standards in place, taking appropriate steps to identify, correct, 
and prevent any non-compliance. This means that any vehicle safety issues must be immediately 
reported to a supervisor, the Compliance or Legal departments, or via our Whistleblowing System. 
This commitment is stated in our Health and Safety Policy and applies to all Iveco Group products 
and brands. As a result, each brand is invested in pursuing the highest standards of preventive, active, 
passive, and tertiary product safety, so as to safeguard the health of drivers/operators, passengers, 
and pedestrians alike.
The technological features of latest-generation vehicles (e.g., connectivity and assisted/
automated driving systems) make travelling safer and more comfortable. They rely on the 
exchange of data and information between the vehicle and its surroundings, allowing on-
board instruments such as navigators to find the best routes and avoid accidents, traffic jams, 
and roadblocks. Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), for example, are one of the most 
important features in use today; their ability to read road signs and road markings and to detect 
pedestrians makes them a significant advance in human safety.
As is the case in IT and in ICT networks, adopting these technologies brings many advantages 
but also makes vehicles vulnerable to potential cyberattacks. Since the safety of our customers

for all our vehicles. In this regard, we have adopted a Product Safety, Security, and Technical 
Compliance Policy (PSSC), reflecting our commitment to designing, validating, manufacturing, 
selling, and supporting safe and secure products that comply with or exceed the requirements 
of all applicable laws, and to providing protection against cyberattacks by mitigating the related 
risks. Iveco Group considers this a prerequisite for conducting responsible and sustainable 
business, and essential to building and maintaining public trust in our products and in the 
Company itself. 
Through this approach, we work to create, maintain, and constantly support a corporate culture 
of product safety, security, and technical compliance that goes beyond the ‘mere’ rules of 
compliance.
As per our PSSC Policy, we have established our own Cybersecurity Management System (CSMS), 
which ensures security is built into the design of vehicles to provide protection throughout their 
entire lifespan, thus minimising their exposure to the risk of cyberattacks. In December 2022, 
we certified our CSMS according to UN Regulation No. 155, which defines uniform provisions 
for the approval of vehicles with regards to cybersecurity and its management. In addition, we 
install the most innovative cybersecurity technologies on new vehicles, implementing structured 
processes along the entire development chain, and from production to post-production.
3.5.3.1 ROAD SAFETY
Designing products according to high safety standards to protect drivers, passengers, and 
all other road users presents a daily challenge for Iveco Group. We consider it not just a 
commitment, but also our responsibility towards the community. Accordingly, our research 
and development into safety systems focuses on 3 key areas: active safety (aimed at collision 
avoidance through solutions such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), Electronic 
Stability Control (ESC), and Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS)); passive safety (aimed at damage 
mitigation); and tertiary safety (aimed at post-crash safety management). 
In terms of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) with active safety features, the main 
solutions on the market include Advanced Emergency Braking Systems (AEBS), which alert the 
driver to a potential collision and automatically activate the brakes to avoid or reduce the speed 
of impact; Lane Departure Warning (LDW), which alerts the driver when unintentionally straying 
into or moving too close to neighbouring road lanes or road edges; and Adaptive Cruise Control 
(ACC), which maintains a safe cruising speed and distance from the vehicles ahead while on the 
road. These are some of the active systems and tools that help prevent road accidents caused 
by human error, poor driving skills, fatigue, or simple lack of judgment. Furthermore, ADAS are 
classified according to the 6 levels of driving automation defined by SAE International, a leading 
authority on mobility standards development: Level 0: No Driving Automation; Level 1: Driver 
Assistance; Level 2: Partial Driving Automation; Level 3: Conditional Driving Automation; Level 
4: High Driving Automation; and Level 5: Full Driving Automation. The ADAS currently offered by 
Iveco Group include Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Advanced Emergency Braking System (AEBS), 
and Lane Departure Warning System (LDWS). Our goal is to equip all of our vehicles with Level 2 
ADAS, which we began developing in 2022 for new models scheduled for release over the next 
few years. This commitment is also reflected by the strategic sustainability target we incorporated 
into our Strategic Business Plan:    to ensure that 100% of new vehicles manufactured 
in Europe are equipped with Level 2 ADAS by year-end 2026, and with additional advanced 
functions such as Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) with Stop & Go43, Corrective Steering Function 
(CSF)44, and Lane Centring (LC). This strategic target was also included in our Sustainability Plan 
and as an individual goal in the Performance Development Process (PDP).
Following several studies on passive safety  and biomechanics, our light and medium 
commercial vehicles can optionally be fitted with Advanced Occupant Restraint Systems (AORS) 
for enhanced protection in case of frontal impact. Light vehicles also come with the additional 
option of installing window airbags to protect occupants in the event of a side impact.
Manufacturers tend to focus mainly on primary and secondary safety to help drivers avoid 
accidents, limit their consequences, and reduce the effects of any impacts (kinetic energy 
dissipation). However, as underlined by Euro NCAP45, road safety is not only about protecting 
occupants and promoting driver assistance systems. It also concerns better post-crash safety 
management, a sphere known as tertiary safety. It is crucial that first responders know what 
they should and should not do at the scene of an accident. Intervention within the so-called 
‘golden hour’ is essential, and rescuers need quickly available and straightforward information 
on a vehicle’s construction to help remove persons safely from a crash site. 
(43) While ACC allows drivers to maintain a preset speed and distance from the vehicle ahead, ACC paired with Stop & Go helps them 
come to a complete stop.
(44) CSF is part of an electronic control system whereby the automatic evaluation of indicators initiated on-board the vehicle may result, 
for a limited duration, in changes to the steering angle of one or more wheels, in order to: compensate for a sudden, unexpected 
change in the side force of the vehicle; improve vehicle stability; or correct lane departure.

For this reason, Brand IVECO has developed specific rescue sheets and emergency response 
guides, and made them available in the Rescue Material section of its website. Compliant 
with the ISO 17840 standard (defining information for first and second responders) and 
available in multiple languages, rescue sheets are standardised summary documents containing 
all the information crucial to rescuers to carry out occupant extrication quickly and safely. 
Rescue guides, on the other hand, provide more detailed information that is used to train first 
responders, with a particular focus on alternative fuel vehicles.
Understanding that the human factor plays a key role in accident prevention, IVECO’s portfolio 
of digital services includes the unique Safe Driving suite, with features designed to help 
customers become safer drivers. This on-board system monitors a set of key performance 
indicators (KPIs) and generates regular reports that, on the one hand, help drivers to acquire 
a safe driving style; on the other, they help fleet managers analyse trends at fleet level and 
identify driving style improvement areas, enhancing a safe driving culture among fleet drivers 
and thus safety on the road. The Safe Driving suite is designed to enhance the driver’s risk 
awareness, thus improving road safety by reducing the risk of accidents and consequently the 
incidence of injuries to people and of damage to transported goods and vehicles. Safe Driving 
Reports summarise fleet KPIs in 3 categories:
 • Dynamics – which focuses on harsh steering or acceleration, stability control, and 
handbrake use while driving
 • Collision Risk – which looks at behaviours potentially contributing to accidents, such as 
harsh braking or insufficient safety distance between vehicles
 • Compliance – which covers regulations on speed, driving hours, and maximum legal weight 
limits for vehicles.
The Safe Driving suite system is currently available on our vehicle models equipped with a 
Connectivity Box, and information on its features are easily accessible through the IVECO portal.
3.5.3.2 RECALL CAMPAIGNS
The decision to launch a corrective action, also known as a Product Improvement Deployment 
(PID), is made by our Current Product Management (CPM) team, taking into account both 
technical factors and the impact on customers. The CPM team works with the Vehicle 
Conformance Team to evaluate the safety aspects of each PID using state-of-the-art tools and 
methodologies, such as safety risk assessments, and determines whether to launch a particular 
safety recall campaign based on the index obtained. In the event of a PID launch, we notify 
customers and the relevant authorities in complete transparency.
Once a recall campaign has been approved, it is launched and released to our service network. 
This ensures swift completion to minimise customer impact and customer vehicle downtime. 
Recall campaigns fall under our product quality control process and involve all customer-facing 
functions, including brand organisations and dealers. If a campaign involves vehicle repair, we 
utilise various programmes and channels to inform customers about the work involved.
Our Customer Uptime Centre is responsible for overseeing this process for the countries within 
its remit46 and for reaching out to affected customers. Each market concerned sends the Centre 
notifications about impacted vehicles, type of recall campaign, and launch date, as well as 
certified translations of recall letters. The affected customers are contacted via a dedicated 
portal or by letter and email. Countries outside the remit of the Customer Uptime Centre are 
handled by local partners and dealers.
At Iveco Group, ensuring safe and reliable products for our customers is key. For this reason, 
our quality control process includes a Reporting Procedure for Product Safety Problems through 
which both our service network and our people can report any product safety issue found. 
Employees can report events involving any of our products via a dedicated section on our 
corporate Intranet. The reports received are analysed and duly processed by our CPM team. 
In addition, to speed up the reporting of potential quality problems, the service network is 
provided with appropriate Incident Reporting Guidelines.

3.6 Local Communities 
3.6.1 Strategy and Governance
As a corporate citizen, Iveco Group believes in making a positive contribution to society in its 
countries of operation. We want to share our purpose, Values, knowledge, and resources with 
our communities in order to foster development, unlock opportunities, and reduce inequalities 
for people who have fewer prospects due to limited resources. 
Creating value for our stakeholders and for those who live and work near our plants requires 
a clear direction and vision to guide our operations. As set forth in our Code of Conduct, 
we are committed to community engagement by playing an active role wherever we operate, 
contributing to local social, economic, and institutional development through specific 
programmes. Moreover, our Community Investment Policy, available on our corporate website, 
ensures that our activities are managed consistently, defining areas of application at global 
level. 
Against this background, we have also identified risks and opportunities. For example, hostility 
by local communities towards our activities may cause reputational damage and/or affect 
business continuity. Furthermore, both our credibility and our efforts to transition towards long-
term equitable social development would be at risk if we supported projects that were not in 
tune with community priorities or were not socially impactful; the same would be true if we 
were to cooperate with organisations whose conduct or actions were not in line with our ethical 
values. Our approach to such risks, given the scale of challenges facing both planet and people, 
is to support projects that bring measurable benefits to the countries where we operate in terms 
of business and investments, as well as high-value, long-term partnerships. 
Our commitment to promoting equity, inclusion, and engagement also means fostering 
community educational activities. We have thus incorporated a strategic sustainability target 
for education into our Strategic Business Plan, focusing on the jobs of the future:    a 50% 
increase in the number of students involved in educational activities by year-end 
2026 (compared to 2019). Thanks to the many initiatives in place, we were already able to 
achieve a 33% increase by year-end 2023. 
Overall, the resources allocated by Iveco Group in 2023 to support various local community 
initiatives totalled €3.72 million (see 1.6.5.2.2 Local Community Investments  ).
3.6.1.1 STRATEGY FOR LOCAL COMMUNITY INITIATIVES
We have identified 3 main action priorities reflecting our business role in connecting people 
with other people, with goods, and with services across various locations worldwide: 
 • Preserve Biodiversity : we aim to strengthen the connections between people and 
nature, building mutually respectful relationships rooted in the intrinsic value of nature 
(the planet), how it is instrumental to growth (the economy), and its relational benefits 
(human health and cultural identity) 
 • Reduce Inequality and Protect Diversity and Vulnerable Groups : we aim to 
promote the advancement of people, culture, and ideas, and to enhance socio-economic 
inclusion and technological development, by empowering vulnerable groups and migrants 
 • Foster Health and Wellbeing : we aim to play an active role in fostering health, 
wellbeing, equity, and fairness to deliver improvements in education, income, and 
individual living and working conditions.
Driven by our commitment to social development, we empower our local communities through 
5 pillars of action: 
 • Awareness: raising awareness of a cause or issue that reflects people’s lived experience 
 • Education: empowering people and building resilient communities, generating positive 
repercussions that can potentially extend generations into the future (i.e., developing the 
skills of tomorrow’s workforce by promoting STEM disciplines, literacy, improved education, 
and problem-solving from childhood to university) 
 • Mentorship: building the community and fostering closer ties to the Company 
 • Partnership: working in community-based partnerships to identify specific needs, assets, 
and priorities 
 • Tailored Projects: designing and implementing tailored projects aimed at specific 
outcomes that bridge societal divisions and advocate for a shift ‘from stockholder to 
stakeholder’.

3.6.1.2 GOVERNANCE SYSTEM FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES
The main pillars of our local initiatives governance model include: 
 • our ESG and local community strategies 
 • specific decision-making bodies (i.e., our SLT Sustainability Committee and 5 regional 
committees), each with an approval threshold, supported by the Legal and Finance 
functions 
 • dedicated control mechanisms, such as a structured approval workflow and budget 
registers.
The 5 regional committees review and approve projects with a budget below €50,000, ensure 
alignment with local community strategy, and oversee the approval process workflow. They 
meet monthly, or as needed. All local community projects with a budget above €50,000 require 
approval by the SLT Sustainability Committee. 
Such a structured process, led by our Sustainability Department, ensures consistency across 
geographic areas and alignment of all programmes and initiatives with our business drivers.
3.6.1.3 POTENTIAL IMPACT OF OPERATIONS 
ON LOCAL COMMUNITIES
The aspects that could significantly impact local communities, and that Iveco Group is 
committed to improving, concern: 
 • the impact on the health of workers and their families (see 3.2.5 Occupational Health and 
Safety  ) 
 • improvements in the welfare of workers and their families (see 3.2.7 Welfare and Wellbeing  ) 
 • the impact of atmospheric emissions (see 2.1.3.1.6 CO2 Emissions  ) 
 • air quality protection (see 2.2.3.2 NOX, SOX, and Dust Emissions  ) 
 • water management (see 2.2.4 Water Management  ) 
 • waste management and soil/subsoil protection (see 2.2.5 Protecting the Soil and Subsoil  and 
2.2.6 Waste Management  ) 
 • biodiversity protection (see 2.2.7 Protecting Biodiversity  ) 
 • adoption of logistics solutions with lower environmental impact (see 2.1.4.2 Logistics 
Processes  ).
We monitor all of the above, along with other aspects, under our Risk Management system (see 
1.5.1 Risk Management  ), initiating targeted projects (directly impacting local communities) 
at those plants where biodiversity protection and water management and monitoring are 
deemed necessary.
When monitoring the impact of our operations on the environment and on local communities, 
we also consider the suppliers that we rely on and have partnered with, and to whom we 
transfer our best practices. In this regard, they are required to abide by our principles on 
human rights and working conditions (e.g., to reject all forms of forced and/or child labour), 
environmental protection, and business ethics (see 3.3 Our Suppliers  ).

3.6.2 Main Projects
3.6.2.1 PRESERVE BIODIVERSITY
 WASH PROJECT
Country: Kenya (Africa)
Project Developer: WeWorld
Goal: to provide water facilities for livestock and for local food production, so as to 
prevent food crises in periods of drought and reduce conflict between small farmers 
and pastoralists
The Isiolo County is in the central-northern belt of Kenya, with a population of 268,002 and an area of 
25,350 square kilometres divided into three sub-counties (Garbatulla, Isiolo, and Merti). Drought and irregular 
rains negatively impact the County’s economy, causing reduced yields, low productivity, high livestock 
mortality, significant loss of earnings, and a sharp rise in malnutrition. Furthermore, the poor accessibility to 
and availability of water and food resources are fertile ground for disputes and violence over the ownership 
of the means of sustenance. The WASH project aims to increase the resilience of the local agro-pastoralist 
communities (particularly the women and children), mainly by providing water facilities for livestock and local 
food production to prevent food crises in periods of drought and reduce conflict between small farmers and 
pastoralists. It is part of a much broader multisectoral initiative encompassing several complementary activities 
designed to strengthen the resilience of the people of Isiolo County. Indeed, the 168,272 inhabitants residing 
in the two sub-counties of Isiolo and Merti will benefit from fewer conflicts in the area as a result of the project.
Outputs and impacts of the Wash Project. 
Community outputs:
• 2 water pans were built to increase water
availability for agriculture and livestock.
• 2 committees (totalling 30 members) were
established for the management of water
resources and the prevention of conflicts
among project beneficiaries.
• 1,000 families of small farmers and
pastoralists (for a total of about 6,000 people)
benefitted from the water pans, with improved
local food production.
Community impacts:
The Women Empowerment in Agriculture Index increased from 0.9101 to 0.9400.
The Citizens Drought Coping Strategy Index in Isiolo County improved, decreasing from the baseline figure of 23.6% in 2020, to

 GREEN OASES IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC 
Respect for biodiversity and nature are fundamental values to be nurtured 
from childhood. Families and schools play a crucial role in shaping such 
values for the future, and collectively we can support them even further. The 
region of Pardubice (Czech Republic) has a strong need for gardens and 
green spaces on school premises, not just to cultivate plants but also to educate children and 
their families about the environment. Recognising this need, Iveco Group partnered with Nadace 
Partnerství, an environmental foundation operating since 1992, to support the construction of 3 
new school gardens in the region. Each of these green oases is expected to have a direct impact on 
approximately 800 students and more than 1,500 people. By focusing on local schools, the initiative 
will also have a significant impact on the Iveco Group employees and respective families in the 
region, creating a ripple effect across the community. 
COMBATING THE DESERTIFICATION 
OF THE ARAL SEA IN UZBEKISTAN
Over the last 50 years, the Aral Sea has shrunk dramatically, losing 
90% of its water volume, and the wetland ecosystems of both the 
Amu Darya and Syr Darya river deltas have disappeared. The receding waters have 
led to the desertification of extensive areas of the seabed, leaving them exposed and 
covered with salt and toxic chemicals. Furthermore, frequent droughts and dust storms 
cause the dispersion of some 75 million tons of toxic salts and sand from the dry seabed 
every year, significantly impacting the health of the local population. As a result, rates of 
cancer and tuberculosis are much higher, and access to safe drinking water is limited. Our 
brand IVECO has launched a project to help address these problems by planting 10,000 
Saxaul tree seedlings, a species native to western Uzbekistan able to grow in the region’s 
harsh conditions and high-salinity soil. With this initiative, IVECO is supporting Yashil 
Makon, a major ecological programme launched by the Republic of Uzbekistan in 2021, 
joining nationwide efforts to increase the country’s green areas.

AND VULNERABLE GROUPS
 SUPPORTING EDUCATION AND PROTECTING CHILDREN 
Country: Ethiopia (East Africa) 
Project developer: Save the Children 
Goal: supporting children’s education and protection.
In Ethiopia (East Africa), despite access to public education significantly improving in recent decades, quality 
education remains a challenge. Assessments of reading skills among children indicate that, after completing 
grade 2 and 3, a significant percentage are unable to read fluently in their native language, with the poorest 
skills found in the SNNPR (South Nations, Nationalities, and People’s Region) and Sidama regions.
In 2022, we began supporting Save the Children’s Literacy Boost, an innovative, evidence-based approach to 
improving literacy learning outcomes. The main focus during this first year of collaboration was on boosting 
children’s literacy skills by enhancing the expertise of teachers and education experts, providing them with 
coaching and mentoring, strengthening relationships within the education sector at national, regional, and 
district level, and facilitating the initiative’s integration and implementation into the primary school curriculum 
across Ethiopia. Furthermore, recognising the impact of digital technology on improving the quality of education 
(especially in terms of strengthening the teaching of pedagogy), the initiative also provided for the purchase 
of IT materials. These included 200 smartphones and 1,600 USB/SD flash cards, which were distributed to 
selected schools in Sidama, Gedeo, Halaba, and Wolaita and used by teachers to access, download, and share 
online training content and materials.
Since 2023, the project’s remit has expanded. In addition to supporting education, it currently also focuses on 
safeguarding children from violence and neglect through an efficient child protection system, targeting the 
most disadvantaged children, including some with disabilities, residing in remote rural communities with the 
least access to quality education.

 FUORICLASSE IN MOVIMENTO
Country: Italy (Europe) 
Project developer: Save the Children 
Goal: to foster students’ participation and wellbeing at school and fight early 
school dropouts.
Iveco Group sponsors the project Fuoriclasse in Movimento , backed by Save the Children, which promotes 
the wellbeing and motivation of teenage girls and boys. More specifically, it focuses on enhancing their self-
esteem in light of contemporary challenges and needs, and on building collaboration among pupils, teachers, 
and families to reduce the number of school dropouts. The initiative also supports systemic change in school 
policies, and new proactive and synergistic approaches and tools to deliver high-quality, equitable, and 
inclusive education with the involvement of the teaching community.
Fuoriclasse in Movimento  promotes pupil participation, trains teachers and school leaders on the issues of 
inclusive teaching, and supports closer relationships with families and local education communities. It also 
enables the exchange of best practices among schools. At its core are the Fuoriclasse Councils, which are 
courses run by teacher and pupil representatives aimed at identifying shared solutions to improve spaces, 
teaching, relationships, and collaboration with the community at each school involved.

 TECHPRO2 PROJECT 
Country: Italy (Europe); China (East Asia); Ethiopia and South Africa (Africa) 
Project developer: Don Bosco Salesian Society 
Goal: to train mechatronic specialists to meet market demand.
The growing mismatch between supply of and demand for industrial skills is one of the main causes of high 
youth unemployment around the globe, especially in many developing countries. 
Our global TechPro2 joint project is the result of a long-standing partnership with the Don Bosco Salesian 
Society. Its aim is to train mechatronic specialists to meet the market’s growing demand for qualified personnel, 
creating in turn more job opportunities for these young individuals – especially within our Company’s sales 
and service network. 
Training includes theory and hands-on learning at Salesian centres, followed by targeted internships in the 
field. The objective is twofold: on the one hand, to ensure students have a future vocation; on the other, 
to enhance the quality of specialised technical assistance for our products while meeting the demand for 
qualified technicians at authorised dealers and workshops. To achieve this, we provide expertise by training 
the teachers, who in turn pass on their knowledge to students in the classroom. We also offer financial aid, 
tools, and essential parts (such as complementary vehicles, engines, drives, and diagnostic tools) for classroom 
training and practice.

 CONBECA PROJECT 
Country: Argentina (South America)
Project developer: Asociación Conciencia
Goal: to provide access to and continuity in education for students in secondary 
schools who lack economic resources.
CONBECA is a programme run by Asociación Conciencia since 2003 to ensure education access and 
continuity for students from low-income families attending secondary schools who demonstrate effort, good 
performance, and commitment in their studies. It is designed to provide them with the necessary support, tools, 
and resources to enhance their opportunities in adult life. 
In Cordoba, as part of this programme, we have helped set up a social, educational, and vocational project 
to support students (aged 17-19) from the El Quebracho neighbourhood, in collaboration with the Los 
Pekkes Foundation. The project offers individual guidance and training in socio-emotional skills, supporting 
the students in their journey towards graduation during their final years of secondary school. To date, it has 
benefitted 12 teenagers and their families.
In 2023, 5 students who were part of the previous year’s programme successfully passed all their subjects, 
achieving their target grades; 7 students attending the penultimate year advanced to the final school year; and 
5 students attending their final year chose to pursue higher education.

 OZHARVEST
Country: Australia (Australia and New Zealand)
Project developer: OzHarvest
Goal: to provide food rescue and distribution services.
Iveco Group has partnered with OzHarvest, Australia’s leading food rescue organisation whose mission is to 
fight food waste. This partnership allows us to contribute to the provision of 200,000 meals to people in need 
through the organisation’s Food Rescue programme. It also allows us to help prevent 100,000 kilos of food 
from going to landfill and avoid 660,000 kilos of greenhouse gas emissions. Founded in 2004, OzHarvest 
supports 1,500 charities across Australia, providing food to vulnerable people in need.
The Company also provides road support with OzHarvest through 16 IVECO Daily vans that play a crucial 
role in distributing rescued food to charities around the country. These vans are equipped to make them 
comfortable, safe, and easy to drive for the team rescuing and delivering food every day.
Outputs and impacts of the OZHARVEST Project.
Community outputs:
• 200,000 meals were delivered to those in need.
• 100,000 kilos of food were saved from going to landfill.
• 660,000 kilos of greenhouse gas emissions were avoided.
Community impacts: 
The project allows saving as much fresh and nutritious food as possible, and delivering it directly to over 1,500 charities across the country.
The project allows saving landfill space and preserving the resources originally invested in creating the rescued food, including energy, water, and money.
The reduction in food sent to landfill means fewer CO2
emissions.
 MENTAL HEALTH CARE 
Country: Czech Republic (Europe)
Project developer: Péče o Duševní Zdraví
Goal: to provide professional mental health support to people of all ages across 
the region.
In a global context in which mental health issues are on the rise, the Czech Republic is suffering from a 
shortage of over 1,000 professionals in the fields of psychology, psychotherapy, and psychiatry. 
For this reason, we decided to help expand the support network and contribute to development and training 
programmes for the professional staff working at the NPO/NGO Péče o Duševní Zdraví, which provides 
assistance to people over the age of 16 suffering from schizophrenia, from bipolar, neurotic, and personality 
disorders, and from other serious mental health issues. The organisation’s objective is to help patients on their 
recovery journey, providing them with the coping mechanisms to manage their symptoms and live a happy 
life wherever they are.

 ENERGISING RESEARCH WITH TELETHON 
Iveco Group sponsors a young Principal Investigator (PI) at the Telethon 
Institute of Genetics and Medicine (TIGEM) in Pozzuoli (Italy). This PI is 
carrying out highly innovative research on molecular mechanisms in 
genetic kidney disease, which still has no cure to date.
Using a very complex in-vitro system, the research aims to grow so-called kidney organoids, 
i.e., small kidneys from stem cells in a lab setting, using patients’ stem cells or those engineered 
in the lab to resemble cells from patients. This in-vitro system is also being used to test old 
and new drugs in order to study their potential benefits and side effects, their safety, and their 
efficacy. 
 FOOD COLLECTION IN SPAIN
Iveco Group’s partnership with food bank Banco de Alimentos  
started back in 2017 under our former corporate structure. In 2023, 
thanks to this collaboration, our plants in Madrid and Valladolid (Spain) 
donated a combined total of more than 1,000 kilos of food collected by 
approximately 300 employees, with the Company contributing further 
by matching their donation. 33 of our people (5 in Valladolid and 28 in Madrid) also contributed 
to the initiative by volunteering one hour each during their work shifts. 
 FROM SPORT TO EMPLOYMENT AND SOCIAL INCLUSION 
In France, Iveco Group supports Sport dans la Ville , a leading non-
profit organisation assisting disadvantaged young people through 
sport and job-readiness initiatives, supporting them in their personal 
development and giving them access to training, employment, and 
business startups.
In Italy, our Brand IDV provided support to the Paralympic Defense Sports Group (GSPD), an 
outstanding sports initiative within the Italian Paralympic Committee, by donating an IVECO 
Daily 4×2 van especially equipped to cater for the needs of the paralympic athletes.
 PREVENTING BREAST CANCER IN TUNISIA
Networking with like-minded partners is a powerful driver to bring about 
desired change, given the scale of challenges facing the planet and 
people. Neapolis Pharma and the Nour  Ne association, working 
alongside the Ministry of Public Health, have acquired an IVECO 
Eurocargo truck and fitted it out with medical equipment for performing 
mammograms to offer Tunisian women preventative breast cancer screenings. The Eurocargo has 
been equipped with a cutting-edge scanner, a breast ultrasound machine, and an area for clinical 
examinations. The vehicle will tour Tunisia to bring health care to women in the country’s less 
accessible regions, enabling the early detection of breast cancer while saving women the time and 
cost of arranging their own transport.

3.6.2.4 EMERGENCY RELIEF
Between 2022 and 2023, the number of people affected by emergency crises increased 
worldwide. As a corporate citizen committed to social responsibility, we understand the 
meaningful impact of collaborating with non-governmental organisations and civil society. For 
this reason, we wasted no time in mobilising resources throughout the year – both in cash and 
in-kind – based on proximity and unfolding events and driven by a desire to provide tangible 
support to our communities. This was the case in the aftermath of the war in Ukraine, the 
earthquakes in Türkiye, Syria, and Morocco, and the flooding in Italy’s Emilia Romagna Region.
In Ukraine, in 2023, Iveco Group supported a project by the AVSI Foundation to create: 3 child-
friendly spaces in the region, providing children with a safe and protected environment where 
they can play, grow, and express themselves; 2 kindergartens in Arbuz and Kharkiv, respectively; 
and a multisectoral humanitarian community centre on the premises of the Vocational Education 
Institute in the city of Izyum, which has endured a devastating occupation. The aim is to help 
restore some sense of normality to the lives of the local residents, traumatised by months of 
serious human rights violations. Moreover, through the Unbroken Kids project run by NGO 
Soleterre, we also contributed to the renovation of a rehabilitation centre at the Saint Nicholas 
Hospital in the city of Lviv, with the aim of providing psychological support and rehabilitation 
to hundreds of children injured in the war, including amputees and those with blast injuries. 
At the centre, we provided support for the construction of a therapeutic pool and of two office 
spaces where dedicated professionals will ensure the continuity of the new centre’s mental health 
services. In response to the earthquake in Türkiye and Syria, we helped provide urgent aid to 
address the immediate needs of those affected by the calamity – in terms of shelters, medical 
supplies, health care services, education assistance, food/NFI47 kits, and drinking water. We did so 
through community-based partnerships so as to specifically hone in on the unique needs of these 
communities and roll out tailored projects that would ensure the desired outcomes.
In Italy, following the flooding in the Emilia Romagna Region, we worked closely with the 
civil protection unit and local associations to provide support and assistance, including by 
supplying our MAGIRUS portable fire pumps to help with rescue efforts. Alongside the Specchio 
dei tempi Foundation, the Company is also supporting a project called Le Botteghe di Pinocchio 
(Pinocchio’s Workshops), an after-school educational programme at the Comprehensive 
Institute of Modigliana. The project aims to provide support to teenagers, particularly those 
(47) Non-food items.
who are experiencing emotional issues hindering their school interactions and learning. This 
support is provided through so-called Botteghe Pomeridiane (Afternoon Workshops) serving 
as a place for monitoring and for meaningful conversations. The after-school programme will 
enhance educational activities, as well as facilitate student transport within the municipality, 
which has been devasted by hundreds of landslides after the flooding.
In Morocco, following 2023’s earthquake, we partnered with Soleterre and WeWorld to 
respond to the immediate needs of the population most affected by the calamity, and to lay the 
foundations to provide our support even beyond the initial emergency, so as to ensure medium-
long term assistance to the most affected families and vulnerable groups.
3.6.2.5 Other Projects 
In South America, our Cordoba plant (Argentina) used its waste materials to build a greenhouse 
for growing native tree species for reforestation. It also planted 300 seedlings in the La Calera 
Natural Defense Reserve and 250 trees in the Parque General San Martín  Nature Reserve, 
with the support of Company volunteers and their families. The Company also implemented a 
project called Educar hasta la en cima (Education to the Top), with the support of 85 volunteers 
comprising employees and their families, providing for the renovation of a municipal school in the 
Altas Cumbres neighbourhood located at an altitude of 2,200 metres. The project impacted 35 
students. In Sete Lagoas (Brazil), we supported the Próximo Passo project in the city’s Cidade 
de Deus neighbourhood, in partnership with the NGO Cooperação para  Desenvolvimento e 
Morada Humana (Cooperation for Housing Development). The project was designed to offer 
young individuals a programme of socio-educational workshops, theatre workshops, music 
lessons, and sport as a means to tackle school dropout rates. Its aim is to help them develop socio-
emotional skills (such as self-control, empathy, self-esteem, and confidence) and combat shyness 
and insecurity through emotional self-awareness, self-motivation, the ability to read emotions, 
creativity, and social interaction. In 2023, 120 children and teenagers benefitted directly from the 
project. We also supported Próximo Passo’s Conexão de Vida (Life Connection) project leveraging 
a tax incentive designed to encourage initiatives for the elderly. The project aims to encourage 
socialising and promote the physical and mental health of the over-60s through cultural activities 
and shared experiences, so as to strengthen their bonds with one another, their families, and 
their surrounding communities. In 2023, the project impacted 130 people. Still in the Cidade de

Human and Labour Rights Management Our People Our Suppliers Our Dealership Our Customers Local Communities
Deus neighbourhood, we supported the Semeando o Futuro (Sowing the Future) project aimed 
at promoting the development of young people, with workshops on socialising, contributing to 
the community, and qualifications for the job market. The goal is to develop skills and empower 
individuals to improve their current living conditions. In 2023, the project involved about 30 
children. Located in the Cerrado biome, an especially rich ecosystem, our plant in Sete Lagoas 
is surrounded by native pequi trees. In collaboration with a local municipal school, company 
volunteers organised a course for residents in the Jardim dos Pequis neighbourhood, focusing 
on entrepreneurship and tools to generate income from the fruit of this indigenous tree. In 2023, 
the project involved 25 people within the community. As regards assisting unemployed people in 
Sete Lagoas in attaining the necessary skills to fill Company positions, we provided professional 
training through the Escola IVECO  (IVECO school), in partnership with the SENAI Institution. 
Courses focus on the development of technical and behavioural skills through distance and in-
person classes, and the school also features an exclusive programme for women. In 2023, 175 
people received training (104 women and 71 men).
IVECO’s Solidarity Cargo project, started in Brazil in 2015 under our former corporate structure, 
aims to help socially vulnerable people and takes place around Christmas. In 2023, 15 employees 
at our plant in Sete Lagoas volunteered to help load an IVECO S-WAY with items for donation. The 
project is also about connectivity and digital inclusion, reaching out and offering opportunities to 
children, young people, adults, and the elderly alike. We selected the community to benefit from 
the initiative after identifying Alagoas as one of the states with the lowest rates of internet access 
in Brazil. Specifically, we chose Piaçabuçu, a small town along the São Francisco River where 
people have limited access to the internet and to computer equipment. IVECO partnered with the 
NGO Olha o Chico and renovated one of its rooms to serve as a digital teaching space, donating 
11 computers, 1 camera, and other equipment, as well as tables and chairs. Furthermore, with 
support from a movement known as Web Para Todos (Web for All), the Brand also organised 
digital teaching classes to train the trainers tasked with teaching the students
TACKLING VIOLENCE 
AGAINST WOMEN
Our collaboration with ActionAid Italia is a force for change. In 2023, 
by supporting this international charity that works with women 
and girls living in poverty, we contributed to 2 projects that engaged 12 European 
schools and young individuals in campaigns to combat peer violence; the projects 
also engaged women victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) in co-planning actions 
to advocate for employment rights and economic empowerment for those who have 
survived violence. Iveco Group sponsored WE GO! (Women Economic-independence & 
Growth Opportunity), a European programme developed in close synergy with other 
European partners from Spain, UK, France, Greece, Cyprus, Sweden, and Bulgaria aimed 
at supporting women who have escaped violence, and at helping them to reintegrate 
socially and professionally. A result of the WE GO! initiative was the release of The Rights 
at Stake Report, an analysis of national and regional policies and tools to support women 
in achieving full emancipation, and a crucial means of helping them to permanently 
distance themselves from violent partners. The initiative also led to a further Policy 
Paper, which contains recommendations directed at political decision-makers on how to 
shape policies to prevent and combat male violence against women. We also supported 
Youth for Love, another ActionAid project, which operates in Italy, Greece, Belgium, and 
Romania and focuses on educating high school students among whom the negative 
impact of social rules driving peer gender-based violence is so often overlooked. The 
project delivered training modules on the different forms, causes, and consequences 
of gender-based and peer-to-peer violence, and on how stereotypes are culturally 
transmitted and widespread among peers. Furthermore, a community-based Intervention 
Toolkit was created to empower students, school staff, and educators to design and 
implement youth-led campaign and advocacy activities at local level to prevent and fight 
peer violence. This initiative was in recognition of the fact that young people, both within 
and outside the school context, can be powerful agents of change and play a pivotal role 
in making their communities more inclusive, safe, and youth-friendly.

Our Sustainability Plan
4.1 Our Sustainability Plan
The Sustainability Plan is a statement of our people’s commitment to contributing to  
Iveco Group’s growth in harmony with society and the planet; its measurable and substantiated 
targets are clear and unequivocal pledges by the Company to its stakeholders. 
The Plan also includes our strategic sustainability targets, which are an integral part of  
Iveco Group’s Strategic Business Plan. It should be noted that, in keeping with the previous year, 
2023’s executive compensation was linked, among other things, to the achievement of two 
of these strategic targets: specifically, the long-term incentive plan was linked to the reduction 
in CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2) compared to 2019, while the short-term incentives were 
linked to the increase in management positions held by women.
All targets within our Sustainability Plan are:
 • consistent with the 4 priorities that underpin Iveco Group’s sustainability strategy
 • specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART)
 • contributing to the achievement of some of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
 • identified and set by our corporate functions with the assistance of the Sustainability 
Department
 • approved by the SLT Sustainability Committee.
The Plan is updated annually and reviewed mid-year by the SLT Sustainability Committee and 
by the ESG Committee of the Board of Directors.
The Sustainability Plan represents our path to continuous improvement and, by staying on 
course, we were actually able to achieve some of our targets in 2023, ahead of schedule. As 
a result, they have been revised, made more ambitious, and incorporated into the Plan, with 
details provided in the respective footnotes. The results reported, on the other hand, are those 
measured against the original targets.

4.2 Report Parameters 
4.2.1 Sustainability Report Contents 
Our second annual Sustainability Report aims to give stakeholders a comprehensive overview of 
the Company’s operations, integrating our financial results and economic commitments with our 
environmental and social ones. The topics covered in this Report originate from the materiality analysis. 
As per the GRI Standards (GRI 1: Foundation 2021, Requirement 5), one or more of the disclosures 
listed in the GRI Topic Standards were monitored and reported for each material topic.
The contents of the Report were integrated with the information requirements of ESG investors and 
financial and non-financial analysts who periodically review Iveco Group’s sustainability performance. 
Iveco Group’s strategic approach is set out in chapter 1.2 We Go Beyond, which also includes the 
Sustainability Model summarising the Company’s approach to sustainability, and explains how 
the materiality analysis evolved from a context analysis tool into a business tool used by senior 
management to identify strategic targets consistent with, and integrated into, our business strategy.
Sustainability Report contents are selected through a process of exchange and comparison 
across Iveco Group’s internal structures, via a network of representatives within the different 
organisational areas that oversee the implementation of initiatives and the reporting of 
sustainability performance.
Defining the contents of the Report is a process based on principles of materiality, stakeholder 
inclusiveness, sustainability context, and completeness. This complex and systematic process, 
which takes place during the Report’s planning phase – in part through the materiality analysis 
– focuses on defining the topics and scope considered relevant to Iveco Group’s business and 
stakeholders owing to their economic, environmental, and social impact. The Report provides 
as complete a representation as possible of the relevant information, defining environmental 
and social action priorities and timeframes, to enable a thorough evaluation by stakeholders. 
Ensuring the quality of information, on the other hand, is a process that concerns principles 
of balance, comparability, accuracy, timeliness, clarity, and reliability as per the GRI Sustainability 
Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). Indeed, the annual Sustainability Report describes positive 
trends as well as weaknesses and areas for improvement, with the aim of presenting a clear and 
balanced picture of Iveco Group’s sustainability performance to its stakeholders. Furthermore, 
information and quantitative data is collected in such a way as to enable data comparability over 
several years and between similar organisations, for an accurate reading of the information provided.
The preparation of the Sustainability Report was contingent on a systematic information and 
data retrieval process, crucial to ensure the accuracy of sustainability performance reporting. 
Approximately 200 key performance indicators (KPIs) were reported in this document. Where 
available, computerised management and control systems (e.g., the SAP HR platform for employee 
data) were used to ensure the reliability of information flows and data accuracy. Other indicators 
were monitored using electronic databases (e.g., the SPARC1 reporting system for environmental 
and occupational health and safety data related to manufacturing sites) or spreadsheets, populated 
directly by the representatives of each thematic area worldwide and verified by their supervisors.
4.2.1.1 SCOPE
Unless otherwise indicated, the terms ‘Company’ and ‘Iveco Group’ refer to Iveco Group including all 
its subsidiaries (also called ‘legal entities’, ‘companies’, or ‘group of companies’). 
Unless otherwise stated, the annual reporting period of the Sustainability Report covers 
information and data for the year 2023 – which coincides with the calendar year – for the whole 
of Iveco Group worldwide as consolidated2 in the 2023 Annual Report as at 31 December 2023. 
Iveco Group is divided into 4 geographic areas: Europe, South America, North America, and Rest of 
the World. The countries that make up these geographic areas are listed in 4.2.3.4 Other Definitions  .
It should be noted that the definition of plant  used in the Sustainability Report is in line 
with that in the 2023 Annual Report. The exclusion of any geographic area, legal entity, plant, 
or specific site from the scope of the Report is attributable to the inability to obtain data of 
satisfactory quality or to the immateriality of its activities (as is often the case for newly 
acquired legal entities, joint ventures, or manufacturing activities not yet fully operational). 
In some cases, subsidiaries or plants not consolidated in the financial statements were included 
within the scope of the Report because of their significant environmental and social impact. 
Furthermore, any plant closed during the year was also included in the reporting scope for that 
year due to its impact in the months prior to closure. Any significant variations in the scope 
of the Report or in the data therein are expressly indicated in the text or tables in the Appendix.
(1) Sustainability, Performance, Analysis, Reporting & Compliance.
(2) The following are the main differences with respect to the scope of the 2023 Annual Report. The scope of the 2023 Sustainability 
Report excludes the Fourchambault-Garchizy plant (France) and the Graz plant (Austria). The scope of the 2023 Annual Report 
includes: the ATS plant in Chongqing (China); the IVECO BUS plant in Foggia (Italy); and the EVCO plant (formerly Nikola Iveco 
Europe) in Ulm (Germany) – not yet included within the scope of the 2023 Sustainability Report. Furthermore, unlike the 2023 Annual 
Report, the marine engines production line and the FPT Industrial ePowertrain plant in Turin (Italy) are treated in the Sustainability 
Report as part of the Torino Motori plant and of the Torino Driveline plant, respectively.

4.2.2 Methodologies
4.2.2.1 APPROACH TO DATA CALCULATION
 • Considering 2022 was Iveco Group’s first year as an independent Company, data 
comparability over 3 years was possible only for the manufacturing perimeter and for those 
perimeters of our previous corporate structure from which we could extrapolate the data. In 
such instances, the data reported refers to the 2021-2023 period, while in all other cases 
it pertains to 2022-2023.
 • Any significant restatement of data or information from the previous reporting period is 
expressly indicated in the relevant text or tables.
 • Performance changes compared to previous years were calculated to all decimal places 
available at the time of calculation.
 • Target achievement dates are always year-end, i.e., they refer to 31 December of the year 
indicated.
 • Several base years were selected when setting our targets, for the following reasons:
 • 2019 (for targets regarding CO 2 emissions reduction, environmental aspects, and 
safety) – to allow comparability with performance results achieved prior to the impact 
of external factors (i.e., the pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and the rise in gas 
prices as a result of the war in Ukraine)
 • 2019 (for targets regarding educational activities) – to allow comparability with the 
performance results under our previous corporate structure
 • 2021 (for newly-established targets regarding collaboration projects with suppliers 
and the Net Promoter Score) – being the first available year for tracking these new 
specific targets
 • 2022 (for targets regarding Scope 3 emissions) – to standardise all Scope 3 targets 
following the revision of our product use target, which was modified to align with the 
new regulatory requirements and our updated Strategic Business Plan. 
4.2.2.1.1 Governance and Economic Data Calculation
 • Financial data was collected directly, rather than extrapolated, from the 2023 Annual 
Report, available on Iveco Group’s website.
 • Figures in currencies other than Euro were converted at the average exchange rate at 31 
December 2023.
 • The value added , representing the value generated by corporate business activities, 
was calculated via an internal method as the difference between production value and 
the associated intermediate costs, net of depreciation. The global net value added was 
then divided among beneficiaries as follows: employees (direct remuneration comprising 
salaries, wages, and severance pay; and indirect remuneration consisting of welfare 
benefits); governments (taxes paid); financial providers (interest paid on borrowed 
capital); shareholders (dividends paid); Company (share of reinvested profits); and local 
communities.
4.2.2.1.2 Environmental Data Calculation
 • Regarding both environmental and energy performance, normalised production unit 
indexes were defined to evidence the respective medium- and long-term performance 
trends. This approach highlights enhanced performance due to process improvements, and 
not simply linked to variations in production volumes. Performance indicators are calculated 
on the total number of manufacturing hours , defined as the hours of presence of 
hourly employees within the manufacturing scope required to manufacture a product.
 • Values expressed in tons refer to metric tons (1,000 kilos).
 • Energy consumption was measured via specific measurement systems and converted 
into joules through specific equivalences depending on the energy vector. For example, 
when monitored as a secondary vector, compressed air is indicated in Nm 3 and, through 
conversion formulas, translated into kWh and then GJ. Direct energy refers to the forms 
of energy that fall within the scope of the organisation’s operations; it can either be 
consumed by the organisation within its boundaries, or exported to other users. Indirect 
energy refers to the energy produced outside the scope of the organisation’s operations, 
supplied to meet the needs of the organisation itself (e.g., electricity, heating, and cooling). 
The amount of fuel used for the following purposes is reported separately: to move unsold, 
newly manufactured vehicles to the designated parking lots; to fuel forklifts and internal 
utility cars; to perform engine tests; and to power generators, motor pumps, pressure 
washers, and other devices. The key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess energy 
consumption per production unit and CO2 emissions per production unit do not take into 
account diesel or LPG consumption related to logistics or product testing.

APPENDIX
Performance Indicators Assurance Statement Sustainability Reporting StandardsReport ParametersOur Sustainability Plan
 • At Iveco Group, the sources of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) , besides the CO 2 
emissions from energy consumption, are associated with the use of hydrofluorocarbon 
(HFC) compounds with global warming potential (GWP) present in air-conditioning, 
cooling, fire suppression, aerosols (e.g., propellants), and manufacturing equipment. The 
potential emissions from these substances (CO2e) are negligible compared with emissions 
from energy production; in fact, with an incidence of 1.3%, they fall outside the reporting 
scope. 
 • CO2 emissions  were calculated according to GHG Protocol standards implemented 
through Company guidelines. Furthermore, calculations were made using the lower heat 
of combustion reference value and the emission factors specific to the energy industry’s 
power generation stations, available in the second volume of the IPCC 2006 Guidelines. In 
terms of emission factors, only CO2 was taken into account, as CH4 and N2O components 
were considered negligible and therefore de minimis.
 • Scope 1 emissions are the direct emissions generated by the Company’s consumption 
of fossil fuels for internal use and operations, including heating buildings, operating 
Company equipment, and running generators. As per Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory 
procedures, the following sources were excluded from the Scope 1 emissions inventory 
when classified as de minimis, i.e., their value was less than or equal to a threshold of 3% 
of a plant’s CO2 emissions (location-based method):
 • organic-based technical gas
 • fugitive emissions, for example generated by fixed appliances or when recharging 
vehicles’ on-board air-conditioning compressors using HFC or HCFC refrigerants 
 • emissions from internal transport operations carried out using vehicles that are 
Company-owned or leased from third parties 
 • fire suppression equipment that operates with greenhouse gases (e.g., CO 2, HFCs, 
F-gases)
 • refrigerants
 • direct methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from fuel combustion.
 • Scope 2 emission s are indirect emissions associated with the purchase of energy. For 
Scope 2 emissions accounting, we have applied the dual reporting system of the GHG 
Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, using both of its allocation methods across all Company plants:
 • the location-based method, which reflects the average emissions intensity of the grids 
on which energy consumption occurs (using mostly grid-average emission factor data) 
 • the market-based method, which reflects emissions from electricity that companies 
have actively chosen to purchase (or reflects their lack of choice).
In the case of energy produced and purchased outside a plant (mainly electricity and heat), 
when reporting according to the location-based method, the CO 2 emissions associated with 
energy consumption were calculated, worldwide, using the emission coefficients (expressed in 
gCO2/kWh) provided by the International Energy Agency. The emission coefficients are updated 
every 3 years. When reporting according to the market-based method, on the other hand, they 
were calculated using the latest emission coefficients (expressed in gCO 2/ kWh) provided by 
the following sources:
 • Re-DISS for CO2 emissions accounting in Europe
 • International Energy Agency for CO2 emissions accounting in South America and Rest 
of the World 
 • primary energy suppliers for CO2 emissions accounting in North America.
The key performance indicator (KPI) to assess CO2 emissions per production unit refers to the 
Scope 2 emissions calculated according to the market-based method.
 • For Scope 3 emissions  accounting, we have applied the following methodologies:  
Category 1 emissions (from purchased goods and services) . To calculate the 
CO2 emissions within this category, we applied the spend-based method (see GHG 
Protocol, Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions), using the formula: 
CO2e emissions = ∑ (value of purchased good or service (€) × emission factor of 
purchased good or service per unit of economic value (kg CO 2e/€)). In this formula, 
the value of purchased goods and services we used was the 2023 annual purchase 
value (APV), whereas the suppliers’ emission factors were calculated (by company 
and by sourcing area) based on their 2022 data, using both the spend-based method 
and the hybrid method of the Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions 
of the GHG Protocol. As regards the measurement of suppliers’ 2022 emission factors, 
the spend-base method was applied to a smaller proportion of Iveco Group’s total 
purchases, using the emissions conversion factors developed by CEDA 3 (version 6).

APPENDIX
Performance Indicators Assurance Statement Sustainability Reporting StandardsReport ParametersOur Sustainability Plan
The hybrid method, on the other hand, was applied to a greater proportion of the Company’s 
total purchases, using supplier-specific primary data on Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions 
and revenue data directly extracted from their sustainability reports and CDP questionnaires. 
We also used secondary data from the suppliers’ CDP questionnaires to rectify any omissions 
and calculate the Scope 3 upstream emissions associated with their products. This means that 
all cradle-to-gate emissions of goods and services have been taken into consideration.
Category 2 emissions (from capital goods covered by the relevant target). The CO2 emissions 
from the Company’s capital goods were negligible compared to the total Scope 3 emissions.
Category 3 emissions (from fuel- and energy-related activities not included in Scope 
1 or 2). The activities included in category 3 are: 
A. upstream emissions of purchased fuels 
B. upstream emissions of purchased electricity
C. transmission and distribution (T&D) losses. 
We calculated the total emissions as follows: CO2e emissions (location-based) = CO2e emissions 
of A + CO2e emissions of B + CO2e emissions of C. 
 • For activity A , the average-data method (see GHG Protocol, Technical Guidance for 
Calculating Scope 3 Emissions) was applied as follows: Upstream CO 2e emissions of 
purchased fuels = ∑ (fuel consumed (e.g., kWh) × upstream fuel emission factor (kg CO2e)/
kWh)) – where upstream fuel emission factors = DEFRA emission factors.
 • For activity B , the average-data method (see GHG Protocol, Technical Guidance for 
Calculating Scope 3 Emissions) was applied as follows: Upstream CO2e emissions of 
purchased electricity = ∑ (electricity consumed (e.g., kWh)  × fuel-cycle factor (g CO 2e)/
kWh)) – where fuel-cycle factor = IEA emission factors. 
 • For activity C , the average-data method (see GHG Protocol, Technical Guidance for 
Calculating Scope 3 Emissions) was applied as follows: CO2e emissions from energy T&D 
losses = ∑ (electricity consumed (kWh) × life cycle T&D emission factor (kg CO2e)/kWh). 
Category 4 emissions (from upstream transportation and distribution) . This category 
includes inbound, outbound, and spare parts logistics services outsourced by the Company to 
third parties. The CO2 emissions within this category were measured based on the Greenhouse 
Gas Protocol (revised edition) for road transport, and on the IFEU Heidelberg method for sea 
and rail transport. The CO2 emissions calculation methodology for inbound transportation and 
distribution varied depending on the different transportation modes, as described below. 
 • ROAD transport  – To calculate the total CO 2 emissions from road transport, we 
considered the following information: number of shipments, utilisation capacity (taxable 
weight of shipment), and distance travelled (in kilometres) for each truck. The first two sets 
of data were downloaded from the Supply Chain Management (SCM) information system. 
The third set of data was obtained by measuring distances according to a Point Map. The 
calculation took into consideration a 24-ton average taxable weight for each truck and 
different region-specific emission factors (as per the Greenhouse Gas Protocol). Based 
on the above, the emissions were calculated as follows:  (∑ (distance in km per truck) x 
taxable weight per shipment per truck x specific emission factors) / average taxable weight 
of each truck. 
 • RAIL transport  – To calculate the emissions from rail transport, we considered the 
following: a 24-ton average taxable weight per container (since trains are loaded/unloaded 
from trucks) and the number of trains and containers per route (information received 
periodically from our logistics services providers). The CO2e emissions were calculated as 
follows: CO2e emissions per rail route per container4 x number of containers transported. 
 • SEA transport – To calculate the emissions from sea transport, we considered the 
following data downloaded from the Supply Chain Management (SCM) information 
system: number of routes and weight transported during the reporting period. The CO 2e 
emissions were calculated as follows: CO2e emissions per sea route per ton5 x tons moved. 
 • AIR transport  – To calculate the emissions from air transport, we considered data 
received from our air service provider and checked by a dedicated internal team. The CO2e 
emissions were calculated as follows: CO2 emissions factor per air shipment x weight 
moved (tons). 
The CO2 emissions calculation methodology for outbound and spare  parts transportation 
and distribution varied depending on the different transportation modes, as described below.
 • ROAD transport (outbound) – To calculate the emissions from outbound road transport, 
we considered the following data: the list of sold vehicles invoiced during the reporting 
period; the distance travelled (in kilometres) per transport leg according to a Point Map; 
the average load factor specific to each product; and different region-specific emission 
factors. The CO2e emissions were calculated as follows: ∑ (distance in km per transport leg 
/ average load factor x specific emission factors).

 • ROAD transport (spare parts) – To calculate the total CO 2 emissions from the 
transportation of spare parts by road, we considered the following data downloaded from 
the Supply Chain Management (SCM) information system: total cubic metres per route 
(total CBM) and distance travelled (in kilometres) per route according to a Point Map. We 
also considered a 50-CBM average truck saturation and different region-specific emission 
factors. The total CO2 emissions were calculated as follows:  (total CMB / average truck 
saturation) x distance x specific emission factors. 
 • RAIL transport – To calculate rail transport emissions, we considered the following data 
downloaded from the Supply Chain Management (SCM) information system: number of 
vehicles invoiced in the reporting period and number of trains per shipment. Based on this 
information and depending on the weight transported, CO 2e emissions were quantified 
using the IFEU Heidelberg method (www.ecotransit.org). 
 • SEA transport – These emissions were measured using the same calculation methodology 
as for rail transport emissions, using data from logistics service providers on the number of 
ships per shipment. Depending on the route and the weight transported, CO2e emissions 
were then quantified using the IFEU Heidelberg method (www.ecotransit.org).
Category 5 emissions (from waste generated in operations) . The CO2 emissions from 
waste generated in operations were negligible, with an incidence of less than 0.05% of total 
Scope 3 emissions.
Category 6 emissions (from business travel). The CO2e emissions from employees’ work-
related air travel, managed directly through our headquarters, were calculated according to the 
GHG Protocol. The CO2 emissions from travel by train (about 4,000 journeys in 2023), estimated 
as 2% of business travel emissions, were negligible.
Category 7 emissions (from employee commuting). The data within this category refers 
to 100% of Iveco Group employees. It was calculated for the sites in Italy (8 sites employing 
approximately 14,000 employees, representing 98% of the total workforce in Italy or 
approximately 39% of the total global workforce), and then estimated for the sites outside Italy 
based on the average CO2 emissions per employee at the Italian sites.
Category 8 emissions (from upstream leased assets) . This category includes powered 
industrial vehicles at plants, onsite trailer tractors, ICT equipment, and leased cars. It should be 
noted that leased assets that use electricity fall under our Scope 2 emissions, while those that 
use mains natural gas fall under our Scope 1 emissions. 
Category 9 emissions (from downstream transportation and distribution) . The CO2 
emissions associated with distribution to end-customers not included in Category 4 were 
negligible compared to the total Scope 3 emissions.
Category 10 emissions (from the processing of sold products) . The emissions within 
this category were calculated applying the average-data method (see GHG Protocol, Technical 
Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions), using the formula: CO2e emissions = ∑ (mass of 
sold intermediate product (no. engines) × emission factor of processing of sold products (kg 
CO2e/engine)). Most of our products are ready for use when they leave our production sites. A 
proportion of FPT Industrial engines were supplied to external customers that sell trucks, buses, 
and light commercial vehicles and installed in their products. To determine the CO2e emissions 
from the assembly of these engines, we calculated the specific CO2e emission factors based on 
the energy consumption involved in their assembly at Iveco Group’s plants, specifically at the 
Annonay plant (France) for buses, the Madrid plant (Spain) for trucks, and the Suzzara plant 
(Italy) for light commercial vehicles. Based on the assumption that the assembly process is 
similar for customers, we calculated the total emissions as follows: ∑ (specific emission factors 
x number of engines sold).
Category 11 emissions (from the use of sold products ). To quantify our CO2 emissions 
from the use of sold products (see Scope 3 category 11 of the GHG Protocol), we used different 
calculation methodologies depending on geographic location.
In Europe, we used a well-to-wheel approach that is the sum of tank-to-wheel and well-
to-tank emissions. 2022 was chosen as the base year for the relevant target following the 
introduction of new regulatory requirements and the updating of the sales forecasts of our 
Strategic Business Plan. The tank-to-wheel emissions were measured based on the assessment 
of our entire model range manufactured in Europe. Since the tank-to-wheel emissions of other 
greenhouses gases (GHG) at Iveco Group are less than 1% of our CO2 emissions, and since our 
biogenic CO2 emissions are negligible, they were not included in our calculations. We looked 
at the diesel-, methane-, electric-, and hydrogen-powered versions of our: light commercial 
vehicles; medium- and heavy-duty trucks; and coaches and urban/intercity buses. Production 
volumes were calculated as the sum of the forecasts for 2026 of our Strategic Business Plan 
and the forecasts for 2030 of our individual brands. The average mileage by vehicle type was 
calculated according to the indications of the European Commission’s latest proposal to amend 
EU CO2 standards for trucks and buses. The average mileage for light commercial vehicles, on 

Page 205:

the other hand, was calculated using Iveco Group’s telematics and warranty data. For trucks, 
fuel consumption and CO2 emissions were calculated using VECTO, an official tool developed 
by the European Commission. For buses, they were calculated using an internal tool. For light 
commercial vehicles, they were calculated using the CO 2 emissions data of IVECO’s fleet of 
Daily vehicles, type-approved as per the homologation tests of the Worldwide Harmonised 
Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP test cycles). Our well-to-tank emissions were measured 
based on information from accredited sources 6, according to which we assigned a weighted 
percentage of CO2 emissions to each fuel type, taking into account fuel extraction, transport, 
refining, and distribution. The total annual CO 2 emissions were calculated as the well-to-
wheel emissions from vehicles sold during the year multiplied by a 10-year lifetime estimate, 
determined based on internal data. It should be noted that this category’s emissions were 
calculated using data extrapolated from our systems as at November 2023 and production 
forecasts for December 2023.  
In South America, the CO2 emissions were calculated by location and by vehicle type as follows:  
CO2e emissions =  ∑  ((number of vehicles sold x average annual mileage (km/year)) / average 
consumption) x emission factor , where: mileage was based on internal telemetry data and 
the emission factors were region- and product-specific based on biodiesel percentages, as per 
nationally recognised sources. Furthermore, both average consumptions and emission factors 
varied according to the fuel used (diesel or natural gas). The total annual CO2 emissions were 
calculated based on a lifetime estimate of 6 years for buses and of 15 years for light commercial 
vehicles and medium- and heavy-duty trucks, both determined based on internal data.
Category 12 emissions (from the end-of-life treatment of sold products). According to 
studies and calculations, the carbon footprint in terms of global warming potential (CO 2e) of 
the end-of-life treatment of sold products accounts for less than 2% of products’ environmental 
impact throughout their entire life cycle, from the manufacturing process to use and disposal (as 
per a life cycle assessment (LCA) conducted in 2022 in collaboration with the Italian universities 
Politecnico di Torino and  Politecnico di Milano on the IVECO Daily Model Year 2021, using a 
cut-off approach).

Administration (EIA); RTE; UN Environment Programme (UNEP); European Environment Agency (EEA); Agence de l’Environnement et 
de la Maîtrise de l’Énergie (ADEME); and Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (FCH JU).
Category 13 emissions (from downstream leased assets) . Our emissions from 
downstream leased assets were included in category 11, and were measured using the latter’s 
same calculation methodology and same emission factors.
Category 14 emissions (from franchises). The Company does not have franchises.
Category 15 emissions (from investments emissions). Emissions from investments, if any, 
were included in category 13.
 • With regard to environmental data , SPARC 7 or similar systems were individually 
compiled for each production department based on respective qualitative and quantitative 
data. Individual Standard Aggregation Databases only include data for the activities of the 
production department in question. Depending on data, the detection criterion was either 
measured, calculated, or estimated8.
 • NOX, SOX, and dust emissions were calculated based on historical average values. Dusts 
are those deriving from the combustion of fossil fuels (methane, diesel, and LPG).
 • The Sustainability Report accounts for industrial waste, which is defined as any waste 
directly or indirectly related to production department activities and includes:
 • waste generated in production departments during normal working cycles
 • waste that, while not directly associated with manufacturing activities, is generated as 
a result of auxiliary or production support activities within the production department 
(e.g., maintenance, logistics, clerical, catering, medical room, sanitation, etc.).
 The reporting scope does not include waste that is not associated with manufacturing, 
auxiliary, or production support activities within the production department, nor waste 
generated as a result of activities outside the normal production cycle.
 • Iveco Group’s wastewater quality indicators – biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), 
chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total suspended solids (TSS) – correspond to the average 
concentrations measured at each plant’s effluent discharge point and weighted according to the 
respective volumes discharged. For each plant, calculations were based on the highest BOD, COD, 
and TSS concentrations measured during the year under normal operating conditions.
(7) Sustainability, Performance, Analysis, Reporting & Compliance.
(8) A value is considered as measured if detected using a certified measurement tool. This criterion remains valid even if a formula is 
applied to convert the detected value’s unit of measurement. A value is considered as calculated if derived from 2 or more measured 
data items using a formula or algorithm. A value is considered as estimated if based on at least 1 uncertain data item in addition to 
other measured quantities.

4.2.2.1.3 Social Data Calculation
 • Human resources data  refers to the entire corporate scope as at 31 December 2023 
(unless otherwise specified).
 • Employees are divided into 4 main categories: Hourly, Salaried, Professional, and 
Manager. Professional encompasses all individuals in specialised roles. Manager refers to 
individuals in manager/senior professional roles and above. They include both full-time and 
part-time personnel.
 • Occupational health and safety data  refers to both manufacturing and non-
manufacturing sites and includes employees, contractors, and agency workers. Data on 
senior managers is not included. Given the variability during the year of reference in the 
use of contractors and agency workers at Iveco Group sites worldwide, their total numbers 
in the 3.2.5 Occupational Health and Safety section are based on basic mathematical 
calculations: figures are full-time equivalent (FTE) and calculated based on respective total 
hours worked.
 • Injury rates were calculated excluding commuting accidents, i.e., those involving 
employees during normal commutes between place of residence and work. When 
calculating injury rates for contractors, hours worked may have been estimated.
 • In calculating days of absence, days refer to calendar days.
 • Investment data for local communities  is categorised as per the principles set out 
in the Business for Societal Impact (B4SI) Framework. Data is based on accounting data 
and methods, and also includes estimates. With regard to local community projects, the 
Company monitors both initiative costs and management costs. The initiative cost may be 
a cash contribution, in-kind donation, or volunteer work (the latter is estimated based on 
the number of hours employees spend volunteering for the initiative during paid working 
hours). Management costs can be internal (i.e., the cost of employee time to manage and 
organise humanitarian initiatives promoted by the Company) or external. The hourly rate is 
calculated by dividing the total cost of personnel by the number of employees. The result 
is then divided by the number of working days per year (240), and again by the standard 
number of working hours per day (8). Figures do not include brand promotion initiatives.
 • The Corporate Community Investment Form , developed in line with the B4SI 
Framework, is used to evaluate the types of benefits gained in the 4 major areas potentially 
affected by any project: people, organisation, environment, and business. Based on this 
methodology, the 4 areas are weighted and the project’s impact on specific aspects within 
each is rated on a scale from 1 (no impact) to 5 (very high impact). An average rating is 
then calculated for each area, representing the indicators (KPIs) to assess the project’s 
overall impact on people, organisation, environment, and business, respectively. The KPIs 
in detail are:
 • benefit to people – positive change in people’s attitude or behaviour; skills and 
personal development; direct impact on people’s quality of life
 • benefit to organisation – capacity building
 • benefit to environment – direct environmental impact; impact on human activities 
and behaviour
 • benefit to business – benefits of volunteering for employees (job-related skills, 
personal impact, behavioural change); improvement in stakeholder relations/
perceptions; business generated; brand awareness.

Emerging Markets are defined as low, lower-middle, or upper-middle income countries as per 
the 2023 World Bank list of economies.
Any reference to Iveco Group’s products and vehicles regards the products and vehicles offered 
by the Company’s brands.
Low water impact  is defined as per the Available WAter REmain (AWARE) assessment. It 
represents the relative available water remaining per area in a watershed, after the demand of 
humans and aquatic ecosystems has been met. It assesses the potential of water deprivation, 
to either humans or ecosystems, building on the assumption that the less water remaining 
available per area, the more likely another user will be deprived.
Industrial water  is the generic term for water used in industry during production and 
processing operations. The rate of industrial water recycling is a measure of efficiency, reflecting 
an organisation’s success in reducing its water withdrawals and discharges. The KPI is the total 
volume of industrial water recycled, as a percentage of the total industrial water requirement11.
(11) The industrial water requirement is the amount needed by a company to run its operations, equal to the total volume of industrial 
water withdrawn plus the total volume of recycled or reused water.
Industrial water recycling is the act of processing used industrial water and wastewater 
through one or more cycles before discharge to final treatment and discharge to the 
environment. 
Contractors are defined as external companies or freelance/self-employed workers who have 
a contract with an Iveco Group company and who provide services within the data reporting 
scope and within the Company perimeter (resident).
Agency personnel are defined as working for, rather than employed by, Iveco Group, and 
are contracted and paid through a third-party company. They are coordinated and overseen by 
the Company’s internal supervisors, and are usually temporary and conduct the same type of 
activities within the same business scope as Iveco Group employees.

4.3.1.3 EU TAXONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE ACTIVITIES
The EU Taxonomy Regulation establishes a classification system (or EU Taxonomy) that helps 
companies identify and direct investments to the economic activities that can be considered 
environmentally sustainable, and that therefore support the EU Green Deal objectives and the 
transition to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. It also establishes six environmental objectives, 
two of which were regulated in 2021 while the remaining four in 2023. 
Climate Change Mitigation (CCM) and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) are the two objectives 
that the European Union regulated in 2021 through Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 
2021/2139 (‘Climate Delegated Act’), which provides for two lists of economic activities that 
can potentially contribute to achieving the CCM and CCA objectives. For each economic activity 
identified, the Climate Delegated Act provides a description and specific Technical Screening 
Criteria (TSC); the latter are subdivided in Substantial Contribution criteria (SCC) and Do No 
Significant Harm criteria (DNSH). 
In 2023, the European Commission published the final Environmental Delegated Act, which 
defines the technical screening criteria of the four other environmental objectives of the 
Taxonomy Regulation, namely: sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources; 
transition to a circular economy; pollution prevention and control; and protection and 
restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.
To be environmentally sustainable under the EU Taxonomy, an economic activity must:
 • be taxonomy eligible, i.e., fall under the description of one of the economic activities
 • (only if eligible) be taxonomy aligned, i.e., meet the TSC. Indeed, an economic activity must 
meet the SCC in order to substantially contribute to an environmental objective of the 
Taxonomy Regulation, and the DNSH criteria to ensure it does not cause significant harm 
to any of the other Taxonomy objectives. 
As of 2022, companies are required to disclose the proportion of turnover, capital expenditure 
(CapEx), and operating expenditure (OpEx) of taxonomy eligible and non-eligible activities (for 
CCM and CCA). As of financial year 2023, companies are required to disclose these KPIs of 
taxonomy eligible and non-eligible activities for the remaining four environmental objectives, 
as well as of aligned and not-aligned activities (only for Climate Change Mitigation and 
Climate Change Adaptation). 2023 was the second year of reporting for which companies 
were required to assess and disclose the actual alignment of their activities with the technical 
screening criteria for Climate Change Mitigation and Climate Change Adaptation, and the first 
year of reporting on the eligibility of their activities with regards to the other four objectives.
4.3.1.3.1 Eligibility assessment of Iveco Group’s economic activities
Iveco Group conducted an eligibility assessment of its core business activities and operations, 
comparing the latter against the economic activities of Annexes I and II of the Climate 
Delegated Act. The economic activities found to be eligible fell within the scope of one of the 
following activity categories:
 • 3.3 ‘Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport’, which represents most of  
Iveco Group’s core activities and operations
 • 5.4 ‘Sale of second-hand goods’ (considered only for turnover KPI)
 • 6.5 ‘Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars, and light commercial vehicles’, which 
represents in particular Iveco Group’s financial services activities.

Page 217:
217
APPENDIX
Performance Indicators Assurance Statement Sustainability Reporting StandardsReport ParametersOur Sustainability Plan
Climate Change Mitigation was identified as the environmental objective most consistent with 
Iveco Group’s business.
4.3.1.3.2 Alignment assessment of Iveco Group’s economic activities – Substantial 
Contribution criteria
For the economic activities identified as eligible, a further assessment was conducted to verify if 
they met the relevant SCC, so as to identify those among them that are aligned with Disclosures 
Delegated Act requirements and determine their proportion of turnover, CapEx, and OpEx. The 
analysis performed confirmed that all technical screening criteria for substantial contribution to 
the CCM objective were met. 
Particularly with regard to the Substantial Contribution criteria, the economic activities falling 
under 3.3 ‘Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport’ and 6.5 ‘Transport by 
motorbikes, passenger cars, and light commercial vehicles’ consist in the manufacture, repair, 
maintenance, retrofitting, repurposing, and upgrade of category M1 and N1 vehicles that meet 
the GHG emissions threshold (less than 50 g CO2/km).
4.3.1.3.3 Alignment assessment of Iveco Group’s economic activities – Do No 
Significant Harm criteria 
The economic activities previously assessed in relation to Substantial Contribution criteria were 
further analysed to verify whether they also met Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) criteria. 
Keeping in mind that our activities are mainly related to the Climate Change Mitigation 
environmental objective, the results of the aforementioned analysis showed that all economic 
activities falling under activity 3.3 met the DNSH criteria with regard to the other five 
environmental objectives as follows:
 • Climate Change Adaptation: for each plant where economic activities took place, a climate risk 
and vulnerability assessment was conducted to identify the physical climate risks material to the 
activities themselves, as well as the adaptation solutions to reduce such risks accordingly
 • Sustainable Use and Protection of Water and Marine Resources: degradation risks related 
to preserving water quality and avoiding water stress were identified and addressed 
through Iveco Group’s environmental management system, with the aim of achieving good 
water status and good ecological potential. The WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas was used to 
identify the Company’s plants in water-stressed areas 
 • Transition to a Circular Economy: the circular economy criteria were met in relation to 
manufacturing processes
 • Pollution Prevention and Control regarding Use and Presence of Chemicals: the 
requirements related to the use of certain substances, as set out in Appendix C to Annex 
I of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139, were met. Compliance with regulations such 
as REACH and RoHS is guaranteed through the collection of information from suppliers 
(IMDS - International Material Data System), the verification of the absence of dangerous 
substances, and the relevant communications required. Iveco Group is fully aligned with 
points (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) of Appendix C. As regards the amendment of point (f) 
included in Regulation 2023/2485 on 27 June 2023, it does not appear to introduce any 
additional requirements beyond those outlined in the REACH Regulation. Accordingly, the 
Company will make every effort to collect and evaluate supply chain data over the required 
18-month period to prove that no other suitable alternatives are available on the market 
for certain substances
 • Protection and Restoration of Biodiversity and Ecosystems: two methodologies were 
implemented at the manufacturing sites adjacent to protected areas of particular 
environmental interest where the economic activities took place, so as to assess their 
impact on biodiversity and ecosystems.
With regard to the economic activities falling under activity 6.5, they met the DNSH criteria with 
regard to the other five environmental objectives as follows:
 • Climate Change Adaptation: for each plant where economic activities take place, a climate 
risk and vulnerability assessment was conducted to identify the physical climate risks 
material to the activities themselves, as well as adaptation solutions to reduce such risks 
accordingly
 • Transition to a Circular Economy: the circular economy criteria were met in relation to M1 
and N1 vehicles
 • Pollution Prevention and Control regarding Use and Presence of Chemicals: both vehicles 
M1 and N1 complied with the requirements of the most recent applicable stage of the Euro 
6 light-duty emission type-approval, as well as with external rolling noise requirements 
related to tyres.
4.3.1.3.4 Minimum Safeguard Assessment
The EU Taxonomy Regulation sets a further requirement for economic activities to be considered 
sustainable: they must be not only environmentally sustainable by meeting the TSC, but also 
socially sustainable by meeting certain Minimum Safeguards. 

Page 218:

APPENDIX
Performance Indicators Assurance Statement Sustainability Reporting StandardsReport ParametersOur Sustainability Plan
More specifically, in conducting the economic activity, an entity shall also implement measures 
to ensure its alignment with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, with the UN 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, with the principles and rights set out in 
the eight fundamental conventions identified in the Declaration of the International Labour 
Organisation (ILO) on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and with the International 
Bill of Human Rights. 
Iveco Group conducted a specific assessment to verify the compliance of its activities with 
Minimum Safeguards.
Iveco Group upholds respect for human rights through its Code of Conduct, Supplier Code 
of Conduct, and Human Rights Policy. Human rights are monitored across the Company’s 
internal operations and throughout its supply chain and customer base by means of dedicated 
processes for each area. To ensure full compliance with applicable anti-corruption and bribery 
laws, an Anti-Corruption Policy and specific procedures are in place. The Company’s tax risk 
management strategy focuses on managing and minimising the possibility of operating in 
violation of tax regulations or in a way that is contrary to the principles or purposes of the tax 
system. As regards grievances, a Compliance Helpline is available to all Iveco Group employees, 
customers, suppliers, and other third parties to report potential violations of applicable laws, 
Company policies, or the Code of Conduct. Lastly, Iveco Group safeguards consumer interest 
through its Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct, which stipulate, among other 
things, respect for the principles of fair competition and antitrust regulations.
4.3.1.3.5 Accounting Policy (1.2.1)
Iveco Group’s Sustainability Department and Finance Department were involved in the 
identification of the values related to the three KPIs (Turnover, CapEx, OpEx). As per the criteria 
set out in Annex 1 to EU Commission Delegated Act 2021/2178 (‘Disclosures Delegated Act’) , 
these departments identified the values to be included in the KPIs from the balance sheet items, 
as described in the next paragraph.
As for the calculation of the numerator, only the balance sheet items related to the identified 
activities (subsections 3.3 and 6.5) were considered. As for the calculation of the denominator, 
all the items provided for by the regulations at a consolidated Iveco Group N.V . level were 
included (as further specified in the contextual information paragraph below).
The CapEx calculation was based on additions to tangible and intangible assets identified from 
Company reports, constituting the basis for any changes in asset disclosures.
The turnover information was obtained from the official consolidated financial statement, consisting 
of the value of revenue from all goods and services sold and invoiced during the period of reference. 
In order to avoid double-counting, all intercompany flows were excluded from revenues.
In order to meet taxonomy criteria, the OpEx was calculated as the sum of operating expenses 
of capital investment projects (by nature) and the costs related to maintenance and cleaning 
(by destination).
4.3.1.3.6 Assessment of compliance with Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (1.2.2)
Iveco Group identified three  taxonomy-eligible activities:
 • Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport (3.3), considering the sales from 
the vehicles manufactured by the Company and vehicle maintenance and repair. Revenues 
from the sale of spare parts and individual components were excluded from the numerator. 
As per Strategic Business Plan 2023 - 2026, the investments related to Manufacture of 
low carbon technologies for transport (3.3) will increase over the coming years, changing 
the industry landscape with a focus on zero carbon footprint and carbon neutrality and 
expanding vehicle line-ups through tailored Zero Electric Vehicle Offerings 
 • Sale of second-hand goods (5.4), considering the sales of second-hand vehicles
 • Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars, and light commercial vehicles (6.5), considering 
any active leasing for commercial vehicles (CV).
To avoid any double-counting in the calculation of the KPIs, the values were determined directly 
from the items included in the financial statement of Iveco Group N.V . 
4.3.1.3.7 Contextual information (1.2.3)
Turnover KPIs
 • The denominator was identified based on Iveco Group’s consolidated net turnover from 
industrial activities 
 • The numerator was identified including net sales from the sales of trucks and buses (new 
and used) and services, revenues from repair and maintenance, and leasing fees. Revenues 
from specialty vehicles (defence and firefighting), from the remaining segments of the 
industrial activities, and from spare parts were excluded.
CapEx KPIs
 • The denominator consists of additions to tangible and intangible fixed assets during the 
financial year, before depreciation, amortisation, and any re-measurements, including 
those resulting from revaluations and impairments, and excluding changes in fair value

Page 219:
219
APPENDIX
Performance Indicators Assurance Statement Sustainability Reporting StandardsReport ParametersOur Sustainability Plan
 • The numerator equals capital expenditures that are part of the denominator referred to 
buses and to light, medium, and heavy trucks and powertrain. 
OpEx KPIs
 • The denominator includes all direct non-capitalised costs related to maintenance, building 
renovation measures, research and development, short-term leases, and any other 
direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of property, plants, and 
equipment
 • The numerator equals the direct non-capitalised costs that are part of the denominator 
referred to buses and to light, medium, and heavy trucks.
The reported values do not include any amounts related to economic activities included in the 
taxonomy analysis conducted for Iveco Group’s internal consumption.
Within the CapEx and OpEx items, there are no items related to a plan to expand the economic 
activities aligned with the taxonomy regulation.
The CapEx and OpEx allocated to the numerator were calculated using the Tool Semplice 
(specific to the Initiatives Mngt system), aggregating data based on dedicated fields for tracking 
projects and on their purpose/objective.
The tables on the following pages contain information on the disclosure of capital expenditure, 
operating expenditure, and proportion of turnover identified as eligible, non-eligible, and 
aligned according to the European Taxonomy, as per the new templates included in Annex 
V of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486 of 27 June 2023 supplementing 
Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and European Council (‘Environmental 
Delegated Act’).

B4SI Assurance 
Statement 
 
 
Overview  
Corporate Citizenship has been asked by Iveco Group to review its use of the Business for 
Societal Impact (B4SI) Framework for measuring Corporate Community Investment (CCI) 
programmes in 2023.  
The B4SI Frameworks help businesses to improve the management, measurement, and 
reporting of their social impact. A combination of three Frameworks covers Community 
Investment, Social Innovation & Procurement for Social Impact. (See https://b4si.net for 
more information).  
Iveco Group has been an active member of the B4SI global network for a year. 
Corporate Citizenship, as global managers of B4SI, have worked with Iveco Group to 
assure the impact of their Community Investment data gathered over the period from 
January 2023 and December 2023 and the application of the B4SI Community 
Investment Framework, in accordance with current Guidance. The scope of assurance 
covers impacts resulting from the company’s community investment and the inputs and 
outputs of the partnerships where impact was measured. Having conducted our 
assessment nothing has come to our attention which causes us to believe that the 
reported data, as stated in the Appendix for this document, does not accurately reflect 
the B4SI principles. Our work has not extended to an independent audit of the data.  
Iveco Group has demonstrated a promising first year of embedding the B4SI Framework 
in their operations, with an effort to collect output and impact data in their key 
partnerships. In our commentary, we identify the main findings of the Assurance process, 
including the strengths to Iveco Group’s embedding of the Framework in project 
operations as well as areas for development where the company can build on learnings 
from this first year. We have further explained our observations in a separate 
management report to Iveco Group.

Commentary  
This is the first full year Iveco Group has applied the B4SI Framework and has been a part 
of the global B4SI Network, accessing guidance and support for its application. As part of 
its efforts to ensure a robust application of the Framework, the company had its CCI 
impact data independently assured by B4SI in this first year. Iveco Group has 
demonstrated a commitment to rigorous measurement and reporting and a successful 
first year in collecting data following the principles of the B4SI Framework. 
Of all activities where impact was measured, the data shows a total contribution worth 
€1,399,915; 92.3% was in cash donations, 3.5% was in time, and 4.2% from in-kind 
donations. From these activities, Iveco Group had a reach of 120,106 beneficiaries. A full 
breakdown of beneficiaries reached and impacted is provided further down in this 
Assurance Statement.  
Iveco Group measures the social output and impact of some of its community investment 
activities which are included in the scope of this Assurance. Of these activities, Iveco 
Group demonstrated a strong understanding of its inputs with a promising implementation 
of output and impact measurement.  The definitions used for each measure are backed 
by the B4SI Framework and are put in practice in collaboration with its partners to gather 
the data. The global sustainability team and local community representatives collect data 
using a Corporate Community Investment Form that is based on the B4SI Framework which 
the global sustainability team then collates and reviews. 
The global sustainability team is also responsible for training local community 
representatives who have access to B4SI Guidance based materials. Impact data is pulled 
from charity partner impact reports, which the sustainability team examines and 
aggregates into Iveco Group’s internal data collection system.  
Our review of Iveco Group’s Community Investment impact data showed a promising 
start in impact measurement. Future developments could address consistency of the 
application of the Framework across all of Iveco Group’s activities, de-duplication of 
beneficiaries, and upskilling colleagues and charity partners in the measurement and 
evidencing of output and impact data in line with the B4SI Framework. 
Iveco Group has demonstrated commitment to continuous improvement in its embedding 
of the B4SI Framework in their operations and making efforts to work with partners to 
collect output and impact data, consolidating a strong base to develop further in the 
future.

4.5.7 WEF IBC Index
In 2020, the International Business Council (IBC) of the World Economic Forum (WEF) published 
a report, entitled ‘Measuring Stakeholder Capitalism: Towards Common Metrics and Consistent 
Reporting of Sustainable Value Creation’. It defines shared common metrics to measure and 
report on the level of sustainability delivered by the business model adopted by a company to 
create value for stakeholders. 
Level of sustainability refers to the effectiveness of a company’s actions in pursuing the UN’s 
sustainable development goals (SDGs). The metrics are based on existing standards and aim to 
accelerate convergence among the leading private standard-setters. Above all, they are intended 
to bring greater consistency to the reporting of ESG disclosures, thus improving comparability 
between the various parameters used in different sustainability reports. 
The following table provides information on the 21 core metrics and on most of the 34 
expanded metrics indicated in the WEF report, as well as references to the relevant chapters of 
our 2023 Sustainability Report.
