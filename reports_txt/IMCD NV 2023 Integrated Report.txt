Integrated Report 2023
1 Foreword by the CEO
 
Dear shareholders, colleagues, customers, 
and partners,
We are living through a time of great changes and 
geopolitical volatility. The ongoing global tensions, the 
acceleration of the use of IT, the health of our planet 
and the consequential changes for every business and 
society are historic and require companies, people 
and governments to adapt and change accordingly 
in order to harness exciting new opportunities and 
remain successful. In this environment of change 
IMCD continued to be resilient.
Despite the challenging economic market conditions, we 
realised solid results and a healthy cash flow  in 2023. After 
an exceptionally strong 2022, we recorded revenues of 
EUR 4.4 billion and operating EBITA of EUR 515 million (a 
3% decrease on a constant currency basis). Moreover, we 
continued to invest strongly into our business to ensure 
a healthy platform for future growth. Here are some 
examples of our initiatives:
 
• Strong investment in new and omnichannel digital 
solutions to further improve the buying process and 
customer intimacy.
• Continuous investment in and upgrading of our global 
integrated ERP and CRM platforms to further optimise 
internal processes and reporting for our principals.
• Acquisition of 13 companies over the course of the 
year 2023 and signing of an additional 5 transactions 
to be closed in 2024, to accelerate the spread and 
breath of IMCD geographically as well as in specific  
business areas.
• Training and development of tools to facilitate the 
collaboration of our people and ensure continuous 
learning and further improvement.
All of this is based on a solid foundation of long-standing 
relationships and collaborations as well as the cultural 
values the company was founded on: entrepreneurship, 
freedom to act, financial  discipline, partnership as well as 
integrity and trust.
I am committed to continue this way, having taken over 
as CEO of IMCD from Piet van der Slikke and I would like 
to thank him for his achievements over the last 29 years, 
building this strong company together with our CFO Hans 
Kooijmans and our experienced leadership team. I look 
forward to continue building further on this foundation.
Having been on the Supervisory Board of IMCD from 2020 
until 2023, I could see the digital opportunities for IMCD 
based on the unique and integrated IT infrastructure 
that the company built over the last years. And I could 
experience the depth of know-how of our people in the 
Business Groups and across the world who can help 
accelerate and support our customers on their journey to 
more sustainable solutions and better formulations.
I see digital excellence and sustainable solutions based 
on a highly skilled and trained workforce, strong 
business development and constant strive for efficiency  
as drivers for IMCD to create sustainable value for its 
key stakeholders (customers, suppliers, employees and 
investors). We still can improve further in these areas 
and will do so through a multidimensional strategy that 
continues to include a focus on organic growth and M&A 
expansion, while remaining asset-light.
As I look to the year ahead, I am inspired by IMCD’s unique 
culture, which I could experience first-hand  in Rotterdam 
and travelling the IMCD world of suppliers, customers and 
teams in recent months. And I am excited to lead our 
company into this new era of growth.
Rotterdam,
29 February 2024

2 Highlights 2023
Expanding our footprint and knowledge
Over the past year, new acquisitions have enhanced our 
portfolio, diversified  our offering  and strengthened our 
overall market leadership.
We have successfully completed the acquisition of 13 
valuable additions to the IMCD family in 2023. Within the 
EMEA region, we acquired ACM (Sweden), O&3 (in the 
UK), Orange Chemicals (in the UK and Ireland), CPS Oil-
Tech (South Africa), and KOI Products Solutions and Tagra 
Distribution Division (both in Israel). In the Americas, we 
expanded our capabilities by acquiring MAPRIN (Chile), 
Allianz (in Colombia) and Sachs Chemical, Inc (Puerto 
Rico). There are several new additions to our portfolio 
across Asia, among them Sanrise (in China), Tradeimpex, 
(in India), Needfill  (South Korea). We also acquired the 
Brylchem Group, including Brylchem and the business of 
Chemipac in Singapore, as well as the business of CMS 
Marketing Trading Co in Vietnam.
In addition to the transactions closed in 2023, IMCD 
signed five  agreements. Specifically,  in the Americas with 
Joli Foods (Colombia) and in the Asia region with RBD 
(China), Valuetree and two lines from CJ Shah & Company 
(India) and shares of Euro Chemo Pharma as well as its 
wholly owned subsidiary Biofresh Green (in Malaysia).
Many recently acquired entities have been seamlessly 
integrated into IMCD’s existing organisation.
Celebrating 10 years Americas
On October 10, 2023, IMCD celebrated a milestone as it 
reached 10 years of delivering formulatory and customer 
service solutions in the Americas region. Today, IMCD 
has presence in 14 countries in the Americas and is a 
gateway for 20 other countries throughout the Caribbean 
and Latin America where access to speciality chemicals 
and ingredients is challenging.
To commemorate this milestone, IMCD employees across 
the region have participated in a virtual 10 kilometer 
walk/ run/hike. The ‘10K Challenge’ was hosted on a 
fitness  app and was supplemented with local in-person 
activities developed to encourage employee wellness 
through friendly competition and to cultivate engagement 
across the region.
Furthermore, teams in various regions, such as Mexico, 
the USA, and Canada, actively contributed to their local 
communities. They dedicated their time through volunteer 
work, committed employment hours, and organised 
fundraising initiatives to support local community 
programs and cancer research.

IMCD is a leading global distribution 
partner and formulator of speciality 
chemicals and ingredients. We began 
in 1995 as a small group of companies 
with a shared ambition and a 
harmonised business model. We have 
since expanded our footprint to over 60 
countries on six continents. In 2023, 
our 4,736 employees, of which 54%

the consumer, industrial and durable goods sectors. 
Mindful of the role we play in creating a better planet, 
we formulate with consciousness and execute with care 
to address tomorrow's business challenges proactively

our local presence, and our wide access to global 
knowledge via a cloud-based digital infrastructure, enable 
us to contribute to innovation processes and shorten 
our product development lead times, while facilitating 
direct access to markets across the world and promoting 
sustainable product solutions.
As a leading speciality chemicals and ingredients 
distributor, we believe IMCD has an important role to play 
in creating a world of opportunity. We help our principal 
partners to market, sell and distribute their products, 
and work with our customers to formulate products 
that create a more sustainable future for all. We strive 
to be the global sales partner of choice – trusted by 
suppliers and customers for first-class  technical expertise 
and solutions that help them innovate and to achieve 
their goals.

How did you get there? Internal 
promotion or external hire or via an 
acquisition? I joined IMCD due to the 
acquisition of Siliconas y Químicos. 
What makes your role interesting? 
The possibility of leading and 
motivating teams, defining, and 
developing strategies and business 
while creating, promoting, and 
developing long-term relationships 
with suppliers and the market. 
Every day is different, full of 
achievements, challenges, lessons, 
and opportunities that fill me with 
excitement, entertainment, and 
passion for doing what I do.
What is the role IMCD has in the 
Chemical/Ingredients industry?
IMCD plays a crucial role in the 
industry as we supply speciality 
chemicals and ingredients. Our aim 
is to provide value not only in the 
products we have in our portfolio but 
also in the final application, market 
and, community. We achieve this by 
utilizing our technical knowledge and 
being innovative and environmentally 
responsible. We strive to create 
innovative, efficient, long-lasting 
formulations that offer benefits to 
the final product. —
How did you get there? I joined IMCD 
from Roche Diagnostics in India.
What makes your role interesting?
The combination of IMCD’s asset-light 
business model and broadness in 
our portfolio is very appealing. From 
industrial products such as lubricants 
& energy to beauty & personal care in 
life sciences. This role has also given 
me the opportunity to spearhead 
initiatives in the digitalisation and 
sustainability space and learn new 
skills with our strong focus on both 
organic and M&A growth.
Is there any core value of IMCD that 
particularly appeals to you? Why?
India is one of the fastest-growing 
manufacturing hubs in the world and 
I believe one of the most competitive 
markets for business operations. 
Therefore, my team and I need to 
be entrepreneurial and nimble to 
provide solutions for our principals 
and customers on the go. Our IMCD 
core values of ‘Entrepreneurship’ 
and ‘Freedom to Act’ enable us to do 
what’s right for the business locally.—

How did you get there? Internal 
promotion or external hire or via an 
acquisition? I joined IMCD in 2008 as 
Sales Manager Pharmaceuticals. In 
less than a year I was promoted to 
Business Unit Manager, Pharma and 
Personal Care. Afterwards I became 
an International Product Manager, 
but when I saw the opportunity 
of becoming the next Managing 
Director of IMCD Türkiye, I went for it.
What makes your role interesting? 
The fluctuating environment in 
Turkiye and the necessity to adapt 
quickly to changes always keep 
the pace high. Team management, 
constantly engaging with new 
topics—I never have a day that 
resembles another.
Is there any core value of IMCD that 
particularly appeals to you? Why? 
All our values are appealing to 
me. Values shape the culture of 
an organization and can create a 
sense of unity amongst employees. 
This unity can serve as a crucial 
foundation for development and 
success. The harmony of IMCD 
with these values is the key for 
sustainable success and positive 
impact.  —
How did you get there? Internal 
promotion, I was the business unit 
head for our German Advanced 
Materials business before.
What makes your role interesting?
The complexity of the region, many 
countries, currencies and legal 
entities makes South East Europe 
uniquely complex within IMCD.  I 
have worked most of my career in 
global positions and always enjoyed 
working with people from diverse 
cultures, bringing them together to 
help achieve a common vision.
Is there any core value of IMCD that 
particularly appeals to you? Why?
IMCD’s value of entrepreneurship 
resonates very strongly with me.  
This value was most evident to me in 
being able to pioneer a value-sales 
training globally within the company.  
I started this locally just for my team, 
but this concept was noticed and 
quickly elevated to a global project 
having now reached hundreds of 
colleagues throughout the world.  
Entrepreneurship means that people 
can experiment and try new things 
out. It means that we sometimes 
must be comfortable with processes 
that can be a little experimental, but 
it also means that ideas 
can blossom.  —

Integrated Report 2023
1.1 Our purpose, mission and vision
As a leading speciality chemicals and ingredients 
distribution partner, IMCD has an important role to play 
in society: we can contribute to protecting health and 
welfare, improving economic prosperity and help create 
a more sustainable future for all.
We strive to be the global sales channel partner of choice 
– a solutions provider trusted by suppliers and customers 
for first-class  distribution services, technical expertise and 
sustainable solutions that help them innovate and align 
their business operations to realise their goals.
Via long-standing partnerships with our principals, we 
offer  an extensive range of high quality speciality 
chemicals and ingredients to our customers around the 
globe. Our broad product portfolio, together with our 
omni-channel market approach, technical and formulatory 
advise and operational excellence, enable us to create 
added value for our stakeholders.
1.2 Our business environment
IMCD focuses on speciality chemicals and ingredients. 
Our technical and formulatory expertise in this field  are 
strengths that differentiate  us from our competitors. With 
our in-depth understanding of consumer trends, our 
highly skilled and results-driven professionals innovate 
with our comprehensive product portfolios to provide 
market-focused solutions that meet the needs of 
customers across eight market sectors in industrial and 
life-science applications.
By partnering with IMCD, suppliers benefit  from our 
business simplification  model, our market intelligence 
and accelerated growth through direct access to markets 
across the world.
Market trends
The speciality chemicals distribution market consists of 
few large global or pan-regional companies and a large 
number of, often family-owned, local players.
There is strong demand from major suppliers for pan-
regional and global distributors who can streamline 
business operations and work as a strategic partner to 
support long-term growth.
As a result, further consolidation within the sector takes 
place with an ongoing focus on local excellence and 
technical expertise. The rationalisation of the global 
speciality chemicals distribution industry is shaped by the 
trends selective outsourcing, preferred partnership and 
increased regulation.
IMCD's market position
The products in the IMCD portfolio are used in almost 
every aspect of daily life, ranging from products used in 
home care, industrial and institutionalised care, beauty 
& personal care, food & nutrition and pharmaceuticals, 
to applications in lubricants & energy, coatings & 
construction, advanced materials, and synthesis markets.
The constant demand for product improvement, 
sustainability, and higher performance drives the need for 
innovative speciality chemicals and ingredients. Diverse, 
complex and international markets require suppliers with 
first-class  knowledge and support. For this reason, we 
continuously invest in technical expertise and application 
know-how, as well as in sales and marketing excellence, 
increasing the value of our services to suppliers and 
customers that partner with us.
But we go further still. Both our suppliers and our 
customers benefit  from IMCD’s ability to simplify their 
business, by providing access to numerous partners via 
one channel, without the complexity of own marketing 
and distribution activities.
In our unique position in the middle, we connect and 
simplify distribution, but also drive innovation with our 
technical and formulatory expertise and provide valuable 
insights through knowledge sharing.
Opportunities and challenges for IMCD
In a dynamic business environment, both internal and 
external developments pose opportunities as well as 
challenges. Below we explain our approach to the topics 
that we believe can influence  IMCD's business the most.
Market consolidation
The consolidation trend in the speciality chemicals and 
ingredients distribution market offers  IMCD multiple 
opportunities. The ongoing desire from major suppliers 
to work with pan-regional distributors who can streamline 
business operations and offer  value added services, 
is a clear opportunity for IMCD to grow its business 
organically. In addition, the large number of smaller, 
often family-owned players still active on the local market, 
provide opportunity to accelerate growth and increase 
scale through acquisitions.
Customer demand development
IMCD’s business depends on its customers’ demand for 
chemicals and ingredients used in the manufacture of 
a wide array of products, which in turn is driven by 
demand from consumers and other end users for the 
products made by IMCD's customers. Demand levels 
vary with macroeconomic conditions at a global level. 
Improvements or deteriorations in the level of economic 
activity and consumer demand impact the level of 
production and consumption of chemicals.

Integrated Report 2023
Availability of and dependency on key personnel
IMCD sometimes relies to a significant  extent on 
the skills and experience of its managerial staff  and 
technical and sales personnel in its local or regional 
organisations. Loss of such individuals or unavailability of 
key personnel could adversely impact the performance of 
such local operations, and hence, the group as a whole. 
IMCD mitigates these risks by providing an inspiring 
and entrepreneurial working environment, offering  
international career opportunities, performance-based 
incentive schemes and long-term succession planning.
Sustainability
In coming years, product demand and markets are likely 
to change due to a shift in societal opinion and demand 
for more innovative and sustainable solutions. This may 
impose a risk of reduced demand from fossil-fuel end 
markets, if and when fossil fuel production is phased 
down. On the other side, there will be new emerging 
markets to offer  speciality chemicals to transition-related 
sectors such as biofuels, hydrogen, renewables and 
batteries which will present an important opportunity 
for IMCD to grow. By means of its sustainable solutions 
programme, IMCD promotes sustainable products into 
the market, supports its suppliers and customers in 
product stewardship, and develops innovative, high-
performance, sustainable formulations. These solutions 
help address societal challenges arising from increased 
climate-change awareness and the transition towards a 
more circular economy.
Digitisation
In recent years, the trend to digitise business processes 
has also entered the speciality chemicals and ingredients 
industry and many players are investigating tools to 
create online platforms or increase digital connectivity. 
For IMCD, digitisation is an important backbone of 
its business model, as it drives connectivity, customer 
centricity, communication, efficiency,  safety, innovation, 
SELECTIVE 
OUTSOURCING 
The outsourcing of sales, 
marketing and distribution to  
a more limited number of 
third-party distributors, remains 
an important part of the channel 
strategy of suppliers. The greater 
complexity in the breadth of 
speciality products, lower order 
volumes and specific customer 
requirements in the various end 
markets are expected to drive 
outsourcing to a decreasing 
number of speciality chemicals 
distributors.
PREFERRED 
PARTNERSHIP 
Suppliers in developed markets 
are generally looking for more 
structured pan-regional 
management of sales and 
distribution. By entering into  
a sole third-party rights of 
distribution relationship with  
a preferred distribution partner 
for multiple countries or regions, 
suppliers are able to significantly 
simplify and optimise their 
route-to-market.
INCREASED 
REGULATION 
In sophisticated markets, 
increasing regulation will require 
chemical distributors to obtain  
a certain minimum scale in order 
for them to be able to fully 
comply with the requirements at 
an affordable cost. In order to be 
compliant, smaller distributors 
may need to upgrade their 
facilities or alter their processes. 
Smaller, locally-oriented 
distributors that currently do  
not comply with the additional 
requirements generally are 
required to make comparatively 
large investments to comply, 
whereas larger distributors  
can more easily make such 
investments due to their scale.

and sustainability. Innovation requires information, which 
is securely provided by our globally unified  digital 
infrastructure. We welcome digitisation as an accelerator 
for business efficiency,  effectiveness,  achieving 
operational excellence and strengthening of relationships 
with suppliers and customers alike. By investing in our 
digital transformation, we believe our business model will 
ultimately gain value and drive further consolidation 
in our industry.
1.3 Our culture, values, and ethics
Governed by strong principles and driven by our 
company values we create an environment that 
allows all employees to excel. In an entrepreneurial 
business like IMCD, where freedom to act is key, we 
promote collaborative employee behaviour and open 
communication so that we can effectively  and swiftly 
grasp opportunities. Our values cut across borders, 
languages and cultures and are the same everywhere, 
always. Together we have defined  our strong values. Our 
employee survey executed in 2022, showed that IMCD 
employees identify with entrepreneurship, freedom to act, 
integrity and trust, partnership, and financial  discipline as 
drivers of their actions.
Entrepreneurship is one of our core values, which we 
apply in identifying business opportunities, attracting, 
and selecting employees and entering partnerships with 
new suppliers and customers. Senior management fully 
supports a culture where freedom to act is encouraged. 
Clear business principles and an excellent cloud-based 
digital infrastructure foster sound decision-making. Our 
commercial, innovative mindset is nurtured by our value 
freedom to act.
The value of partnership is paramount to our business 
and enables us to create opportunities for our customers. 
This can only be done transparently, with mutual 
understanding, and acknowledging local culture and co-
creating solutions to answer specific  consumer needs. 
Our skilled employees are trained to listen and seize 
opportunities when they arise. IMCD enjoys long-standing 
relationships with speciality chemical and ingredients 
suppliers all over the world.
Integrity and trust are values we expect from ourselves 
and each other. Together with our partners we rigorously 
enforce ethical business practices and create a healthy 
diverse and safe work environment for all. Our global 
Code of Conduct ensures that we operate at the highest 
standards, always and everywhere. Through financial  
discipline, we meet and exceed our financial  goals. 
IMCD pursues accurate transparent financial  reporting 
using a global integrated business information system, 
in which we rapidly integrate our newly acquired 
companies. We are aware of the financial  impact of all our 
business decisions.
Being a global company, subject to both international 
as well as many different  local laws, strong ethics and 
governance are of particular importance to us. Breaches 
of laws and regulations, and even internal procedures 
or voluntary codes can have a major impact on IMCD's 
reputation as well as on its financial  results. With 
transparency on our ethics and compliance framework 
and our performance, we build trust with our employees, 
business partners and other stakeholders and enable 
regulatory compliance.

Our core activities
IMCD is able to connect a wide range of business 
partners in the supply chain. We simplify our suppliers' 
business operations by our extensive local networks, 
market intelligence and technical expertise. In addition 
to its sales and marketing activities, IMCD provides 
distribution and other ancillary services. A single point 
of contact, coordinated inventory management, business 
process integration and the digitisation of transactions 
are all examples of the benefits  that IMCD brings to its 
suppliers, which supports and can accelerate their growth.
At the other end of the value chain, IMCD focuses on its 
customers: manufacturers that need speciality chemicals 
or ingredients for the production of intermediate goods 
or end products. By marketing a large and diverse 
product portfolio, we offer  our customers access to a 
broad range of solutions that meet specific  technical, 
quality or sustainability requirements. We add value by 
providing customers with quality assurance and highly 
specialised product knowledge, alongside technical advice 
and formulation support.
Throughout IMCD's business, long-lasting partnerships 
play a vital role. Not only in relation to principals and 
customers, but also in our own operations. Pursuing 
an asset-light business model, IMCD, wherever possible, 
outsources its physical distribution and other ancillary 
activities, such as warehousing, bulk breaking, mixing, 
blending, packaging and labelling to professional third-
party logistics service providers.
Our key competences
IMCD strives to make a positive impact for both 
its business partners and society as a whole. Our 
technical experts in close collaboration with the regulatory 
experts, analyse new technologies and proactively offer  
innovative solutions for the constantly developing and 
demanding markets in which IMCD operates. Together 
with our business partners, we turn market trends into 
sustainable solutions that benefit  the lives of consumers 
worldwide and help reduce the environmental impact.
In our ways of working, we focus on the following areas:
- New product analysis and development
We work in close collaboration with our customers’ 
R&D departments, carrying out competitive matching, 
sharing new application opportunities and assisting in the 
formulation of the most effective  and innovative products.
- Customer seminars
Across our global network, our commercial and technical 
teams organise seminars and webinars, introduce new 
applications and share insights on the latest market 
trends. Furthermore, in our technical centres and 
application labs, and with the support of our scientific  
and technical experts, our customers can test product 
performance, run stability and application tests and 
experience the finished  products and end result.
- Supplier workshops
In our technical centres, suppliers are able to gain an 
understanding as to how their products interact and 
function (in combination with other products from within 
the IMCD portfolio) as part of a finished  formulation. This 
understanding and market trend awareness means we 
are able to assist our suppliers with the development of 
new product concepts.
- Internal training
We continuously invest in our people, by means of 
education, in order to stay abreast with the latest market 
developments, gain deep knowledge of our product 
portfolio so that we provide better services and support 
to our customers.
Our Business Groups
IMCD's business is organised into a number of strategic 
market sectors with eight dedicated Business Groups in 
each country where we operate. This matrix structure 
enables us to provide fully integrated and coordinated 
distribution services on a global scale and facilitates the 
exchange of commercial and technical expertise across 
our organisation. In this way, our expert chemists and 
technical teams can offer  customers both in-depth local 
market insight and state-of-the-art application knowledge.
Each end market is managed by business group 
management to ensure the same high level performance 
across the IMCD organisation. In turn, IMCD’s country 
management is responsible for the optimisation of our 
operations and service provision locally, throughout the 
various market segments.
Our local activities are strengthened by the support of two 
regional headquarters, in the Americas and Asia-Pacific.  
In addition, our global headquarters in the Netherlands 
provides guidance, alignment and central policies with 
regards to sustainability, digitalisation, IT, HR, finance  & 
control and compliance, among other functions.

2 How we create value
As a leading global distribution 
partner and formulator of speciality 
chemicals and ingredients we take our 
responsibility in shaping a sustainable 
future for all seriously. IMCD creates 
value for stakeholders through pursuing 
sustainable long-term growth of its 
revenues and results, driven by organic 
growth and strategic acquisitions. 
Through product stewardship, we build 
a resilient and diversified product 
portfolio that supports sustainable 
applications and innovation.
2.1 Our strategy
Our long-term strategy is in line with the ongoing 
consolidation trend in the distribution market of speciality 
chemicals and ingredients. We use our market intelligence 
and technical expertise to identify opportunities to grow 
our business across different  business sectors. On the one 
hand, we strive to increase market share for the reputable 
suppliers we already represent. On the other, we aim 
to build new relationships with manufacturers of high 
quality speciality chemicals and ingredients, to expand our 
offering  to customers.
Our strategy to create sustainable long-term value is built 
on our people, our innovation capabilities, digitalisation of 
our business, and our continuous pursuit of operational 
excellence. We attract and employ highly qualified  
and entrepreneurial individuals. Our people maintain 
long-standing relationships with speciality chemical and 
ingredients suppliers. These partnerships are paramount 
to our business and enable our professional teams 
to create opportunities. By working closely with our 
customers and suppliers, combining intelligent market 
data with targeted product knowledge, we can innovate 
and offer  sustainable solutions, which enable our 
customers to create products which are better for our 
planet and society.
IMCD's contributions to the environment and society 
begin with its own operations and people, and expands 
throughout the value chain. We want to grow our 
business, while reducing our environmental footprint 
through clear and measurable metrics. With the products 
and solutions offered  in our portfolio we strive to have 
a positive impact on health and well-being of consumers, 
the environment and society.
We assessed that with our business activities, we 
contribute to at least ten of the United Nations 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
IMCD’s contribution
to the UN Sustainable
Development Goals
To execute on our strategy, IMCD maintains a diversified  
and asset-light business model with an outsourced supply 
chain infrastructure, with specialised service providers 
selected based on quality, ESG and financial  criteria.
IMCD uses a multi-channel approach to serve its 
customers in partnerships and in person, as well 
as providing 24/7 online access to its customer 
portal. We use digitalisation as an accelerator 
for business effectiveness  as well as for achieving 
operational excellence.
All this gives us the flexibility  and resilience to respond 
and adapt to changing circumstances and demands from 
both the market and society.

INNOVATION
At IMCD, innovation does not only 
apply to the formulatory work in our

Entrepreneurship, it allows us to create 
something new and move away from 
traditional thinking patterns. Improving 
what exists, willingness to change and

mindset, innovation  
is progress, it is

IMCD Beauty & Personal Care has 
pioneered an immersive, technology-
forward sensorial experience that 
stimulates emotional wellbeing through 
efficacious, market-ready innovations.  
As disruption becomes the new normal, fostering 
innovation is essential to staying ahead. IMCD’s technical 
experts and application specialists formulate ground-
breaking solutions across our different business groups, 
creating new concepts and developing product 
improvements so our partners can maintain their market 
leadership.
The launch of Sensational Beauty, an IMCD ASMR 
Experience, represents a significant leap forward in this 
regard. An innovative collection of prototypes based on 
immersive technology, it redefines consumers’ 
relationship with beauty and personal care products. 
Sensational Beauty is designed to prompt the user’s 
autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR), wherein 
a sensation of tingling created by audio-visual stimuli 
sparks positive emotions. The trendy concept stimulates 
the regions of the brain associated with tranquillity, 
relaxation, and wellbeing. This calming “brain massage” 
has soared in popularity as consumers continue searching 
for enjoyment following the pandemic.
Research shows consumers are willing to pay more for 
beauty products that have mood-boosting qualities. In the 
US, this figure is 33% of the market, according to Mintel.
ASMR beauty line sparks innovation  
and soothing sensations
Developed after extensive research and collaboration 
across IMCD’s global network, Sensational Beauty is in line 
with IMCD’s reputation for creative formulations that drive 
marketplace innovation. The collection addresses the 
growing demand for everyday products that stimulate an 
unparalleled sense of enjoyment and pleasure with the 
help of technology. The range responds to three main 
major consumer trend drivers: a unique experience, 
technology that enhances reality, and a search for joy, 
calm and increased wellbeing.
The Sensational Beauty collection features several 
innovative prototypes. Each prototype ensures a 
technology-assisted experience that generates wellbeing 
and joy while enhancing the consumer’s real-life 
experience. Among them, the Destress Ball Makeup 
Remover promotes a sense of calm at the end of the day, 
with a stress-releasing cleansing product made of 
biopolymers and a blend of bioactives that promotes skin 
firmness, elasticity, and overall wellbeing. The unique 
Detox Charcoal Cooling Masque is an emulsion stick that 
cools the skin while purifying. The Soothing Kinetic Jelly 
Scrub is a two-part anhydrous soothing scrub that has 
both moisturizing and sensorial properties. And on the 
make-up front, IMCD’s new Plumping Pressed Powder is a 
silky, medium-coverage foundation packed with hyaluronic 
spheres and protective microbiome ingredients.
With the new collection, IMCD is ideally positioned to 
support customers looking to tap into the emerging trend 
for neurocosmetics, a new personal care development 
inspired by the profound connection between the mind, 
emotions, and beauty.
“Our team consciously formulated the 
Sensational Beauty concepts to create an 
ASMR experience that evokes emotion, joy and 
fosters a unique immersive experience,” said 
Danielle Wheeler, Americas Technical Director, IMCD 
Beauty & Personal Care. “The careful development of our 
Sensational Beauty collection not only displays our team’s 
creativity and trend knowledge, but also highlights IMCD’s 
formulatory and comprehensive market expertise that 
enables us to shape tomorrow’s Beauty.”

Growth strategy execution
IMCD focuses on achieving growth through transparent 
long-term partnerships combined with market expertise, 
technical development, and innovation. This strategy has 
yielded solid growth based on the following strengths:
• Diversified  and resilient business model
• Commercial and operational excellence
• Skilled professional team of technical experts
• Technical centres and application laboratories
• Committed management team
• Cloud-based digital infrastructure
• Superior margin and cash conversion
• Ability to deliver organic and acquisition-led growth
Organic growth
IMCD's organic growth strategy has four main drivers:
• Increasing market share by outperforming competitors 
through commercial and operational excellence
• Investing in product and formulation know-how
• Expanding with existing suppliers into additional 
geographies and adding new suppliers and products to 
the portfolio
• GDP growth in the different  geographies where 
IMCD operates
Acquisition growth
IMCD benefits  from a highly fragmented distribution 
market and continuing consolidation trend, largely driven 
by suppliers looking to optimise their sales channels. 
Since its formation, IMCD has acquired more than 100 
companies, resulting in a broad global geographical 
footprint. Using its extensive network and in-depth 
market knowledge, IMCD pursues strategic acquisition 
opportunities to further expand and enhance its business 
model in both developed and emerging markets. Finding 
suitable acquisition targets is an ongoing process 
that involves ensuring the right cultural and business 
alignment. IMCD has strict acquisition criteria that are 
based first  and foremost on identifying a strategic 
fit  that provides a platform for further growth, both 
geographical and in terms of complementary product 
markets. Acquisitions are always subject to sufficient  
management attention being available, and to IMCD’s 
requirements for maintaining a strong balance sheet while 
limiting financial  and operational risks.
The primary aim in all acquisitions is to support 
sustainable added-value growth for IMCD's suppliers 
and customers. Barring exceptional circumstances, an 
acquired company should be able to contribute to IMCD's 
cash earnings per share from the date of acquisition. 
Most of our acquisitions are financed  by our own strong 
cash flow  and flexible  loan facilities. Newly acquired 
companies are integrated using a highly structured 
integration programme that provides a swift transition 
to IMCD's internal reporting, control and compliance 
systems and ensures optimal realisation of operational 
and business synergies.

2.3 Our material topics
At the end of 2021, IMCD reviewed its materiality 
assessment to identify the most ESG material topics 
for the organisation to manage, based on the Global 
Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. We have engaged 
key internal and external stakeholders and applied the 
impact materiality principle, which takes a forward-looking 
perspective. In the process, we assessed the identified  
material topics against business impact and importance 
to stakeholders.
In line with GRI Standards, the material topics are 
reflections  of IMCD’s significant  economic, environmental, 
and social impacts. All topics displayed in the materiality 
matrix were assessed to be material to IMCD. Business 
impact (x-axis) is defined  as the estimated magnitude 
of IMCD’s economic, environmental, and/or social 
impacts as a business, considering the related risks 
and opportunities. Importance to stakeholders (y-axis) 
relates to the relevance of the material issues to 
IMCD’s stakeholders: customers, principal suppliers, 
senior management, IMCD people, investors, public 
organisations, and peers.
To ensure effective  management, the material topics were 
organised in the four pillars Environment, People, Product 
and Governance. Each material topic was further classified  
and prioritised as:
• Core focus area for acceleration;
• Sustainability enabler; or
• Area to monitor

The topics Sustainable Solutions, Supply Chain 
Decarbonisation, and Talent Attraction and Retention 
were identified  as focus areas for acceleration. In 
the fourth quarter of 2023, IMCD commenced a new 
materiality assessment, in which the requirements of the 
Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) will 
be included. This process may lead to changes in the 
materiality assessment matrix presented herein, which 
will be reported in the 2024 Integrated Report.
For more details on the materiality assessment, please

IMCD Key pillars for sustainable practices
PEOPLE AND CULTURE
 ENVIRONMENT
 PRODUCT
 ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE
IMCD is proud of its people and considers them 
its most valuable asset. We have no factories or 
products of our own; therefore, the value of the 
company lies in our brand, in the commercial 
partnerships we have established and in the 
quality of the people we employ. IMCD fosters 
an entrepreneurial business culture that aims to 
get the best out of everybody. It also helps to 
attract and retain the very best in the industry. We 
believe that our staff  diversity contributes to our 
overall performance.
IMCD takes climate protection seriously and 
anticipates risks and opportunities relating to 
climate change together with its suppliers and 
customers as well as its logistics processes. We seek 
to reduce the environmental impact of our own 
operations, focusing on reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions from our own activities and in our supply 
chain. To accomplish this, we engage with third-
party logistics providers to encourage reduction 
of Scope 3 emissions. For waste handling and 
disposal we apply high standards of care to avoid 
environmental pollution.
IMCD is equipped with the market intelligence, 
technical expertise, application laboratories and 
product know-how needed to drive forward the 
sustainable solutions that should be at the forefront 
of the industry. We strive to champion the 
sustainability journey of our suppliers and simplify 
the market and the sustainability landscape for 
our customers. In our own operations, we uphold 
responsible ESG practices, including safe and 
reliable handling of chemicals, and ethical and 
sustainable sourcing.
Integrity is fundamental to the way IMCD does 
business. We have strong values and clear policies 
and standards in place to ensure that its employees 
always act in an ethical manner. By asking our 
partners to do the same, we aim to have a positive 
influence  across our value chain.

After an exceptionally strong 2022, the 
year 2023 is characterised by difficult 
geopolitical and macroeconomic 
conditions. Geopolitical tensions, global 
economic concerns around inflation, 
rising interest rates and lower 
GDP growth in certain economies 
impacted confidence and reduced 
customer demand.
Despite the market challenges faced 
in 2023, we delivered solid results 
and generated healthy cash flows. 
We realised substantial acquisition 
EBITA growth, which is the result of 
acquisitions completed in 2023 and of 
the full year impact of acquisitions 
completed in 2022. We achieved 
successes in the further execution of 
our growth strategy, by acquisitions in 
United Kingdom, Sweden, Israel, South 
Africa, Chile, Colombia, Puerto Rico, 
India, China, Singapore, South Korea 
and Vietnam.
3.1 Developments 2023
Despite the continuing global geopolitical tensions and the 
challenging economic market conditions, in particular in 
the industrial market segment, we realised solid results 
in 2023. After a strong 2022 with double digit revenue 
growth and operating EBITA growth of 48%, in 2023 
we recorded revenues of EUR 4.4 billion (on a constant 
currency basis in line with 2022) and operating EBITA of 
EUR 515 million (-3% on a constant currency basis).
In 2023, we successfully completed acquisitions in all of 
our regions.
We will continue to focus on expanding and optimising 
existing businesses, integrating acquired companies, 
developing interesting supplier projects and on selective 
acquisition opportunities.
Despite the continuing challenging market circumstances, 
the financial  resilience provided by IMCD’s multi-
market and geographical coverage, combined with its 
diversified  supplier and product portfolio, have enabled 
IMCD to deliver strong results in 2023. Our teams 
demonstrated collaboration and entrepreneurship and 
by further building on our long-standing partnerships 
with our suppliers, customers and logistics partners, we 
strengthened our performance.
Commercial and organisational
IMCD aims to create value for its stakeholders through the 
pursuit of sustainable growth of its revenues and results, 
driven by organic growth alongside selective acquisitions.

Integrated Report 2023
IMCD’s strategy centres on strengthening and intensifying 
the relationships with our major suppliers, and using 
our network to gain distributorships and offering  pan-
regional services. This strategy is supported by having 
operating companies with well-trained professionals in 
most countries we work in supported by application 
laboratories and an harmonised and integrated IT 
landscape, with modern digital tools.
IMCD operates as a professional services business where 
highly qualified  people collaborate in a flat  organisational 
structure. We will continue to attract, hire, train and 
develop and retain talent. Trainings are organised via 
our e-learning platform and by means of business group 
specific  trainings. Furthermore, employee engagements 
remain high on our agenda.
We have further strengthened our market groups and 
technical capabilities to cater for our increasing business 
and to exploit group synergies. The number of FTEs 
increased from 4,323 at year-end 2022 to 4,736 as at the 
end of 2023 (+10%), of which 290 FTE were the result of 
acquisitions completed in 2023.
We are tracking our staff  turnover and retention figures  
closely, especially in this economic challenging period. 
With regard to our workforce, we remain looking 
for talents, and diversity on all dimensions across 
the world. We remain focused on retaining people 
in critical functions such as commercial technical or 
digitalisation roles.
Acquisitions
As a group we align ourselves with industry leaders, 
and strive to grow our market share organically and 
through selected acquisitions, and continue to optimise 
our business model.
In the execution of our strategy to create sustainable 
growth for our stakeholders, we completed the acquisition 
of thirteen businesses in 2023. In addition to these closed 
transactions, IMCD signed five  share or asset purchase 
agreements which were or will be closed in 2024.
On 28 February 2023, IMCD acquired 100% of the 
shares in Orange Chemicals Ltd (“Orange Chemicals”), 
a distributor of performance chemicals throughout 
the UK and Ireland. Orange Chemicals, headquartered 
in Winchester, generated revenues of approximately 
EUR 30 million in the financial  year 2022 and adds seven 
employees to the IMCD UK team.
On 15 March 2023, IMCD completed the acquisition of 
Shanghai Sanrise Industries & Development Co., Ltd. 
(“Sanrise”), one of the leading distributors in the personal 
care markets in China. Sanrise offers  a wide range of 
personal care and industrial solutions with a key focus 
on personal care applications. With approximately 60 
employees, Sanrise generated revenues of approximately 
EUR 90 million in 2022. The transaction took place in two 
tranches, with first  70% of Sanrise’s share capital was 
acquired in March 2023, and the remaining 30% will be 
acquired in 2025.
On 20 April 2023, IMCD acquired 100% of the share

3.2 Financial performance 2023
All financial  information in this section is presented 
in millions of euros. Rounding differences  may occur 
because the underlying figures  retrieved from 
the consolidated financial  statements are rounded to 
the nearest thousand.
Key performance indicators
In 2023, revenue was EUR 4,442.6 million; on a constant 
currency basis in line with last year. On a constant 
currency basis, gross profit  increased by 2% to 
EUR 1,122.6 million. Operating EBITA declined by 7% from 
EUR 554 million in 2022 to EUR 515 million in 2023 (-3% on 
a constant currency basis). The operating EBITA margin 
was 11.6%, compared with 12.0% in 2022.
The cash conversion margin was 105.3% in 2023, 
compared with 76.9% in 2022. The cash earnings per 
share decreased by EUR 0.37 from EUR 6.78 in 2022 to 
EUR 6.41 in 2023.
Constant currencies
Constant currencies are used to exclude the impact 
of movements in foreign currency exchange rates from 
the comparison with last year results. Constant currency 
results (or FX adjusted results) are calculated by 
translating last year's results at current year's foreign 
currency exchange rates.
Organic and acquisition growth
Organic growth is used as a key measure of business 
performance and excludes the effect  of acquisitions on 
the operating results. Acquisition growth consists of 
the results attributable to acquired businesses from 
the date of closing the acquisition to the first  anniversary 
of the acquisition. Organic growth is defined  as 
the remaining change in the results as compared to 
the prior period, after changes in results attributable to 
acquired businesses and the effect  of fluctuations  
in foreign exchange rates.

Integrated Report 2023
Revenue
Compared with 2022, revenue declined by 
EUR 158.9 million to EUR 4,443 million in 2023. 
The revenue decrease is the result of organic decline 
(-6%), the impact of first-time  inclusion of acquisitions 
(+6%) and a negative impact of foreign currency exchange 
developments (-4%).
The overall organic revenue development was shaped by 
the balance of local macroeconomic circumstances, 
further strengthening of the product portfolio by adding 
new suppliers, expanding relationships with existing 
suppliers and increasing customer penetration by adding 
new products and selling more products to existing and 
new customers.
Revenue was positively impacted by acquisitions 
completed in 2023 (Orange Chemicals, Sanrise, ACM, 
Tradeimpex, Tagra, Allianz, KOI Products Solutions, CPS 
Oil-Tech, O&3, Sachs, SCI Chemical Logistics, MAPRIN, 
Needfill  and Brylchem) and acquisitions completed 
in 2022 (Syntec, Aquatech, RPL Trading, Polychem, 
Evenlode, Polyorganic, Quelaris, Promaplast, Kuni 
Chemical, Parkash and Welex). The total positive impact 
of the acquisitions on revenue in 2023 was 6%.
Gross profit
Gross profit,  defined  as revenue less cost of materials and 
inbound logistics, declined by EUR 24.6 million from 
EUR 1,147 million in 2022 to EUR 1,123 million in 2023. 
The decline in gross profit  was the result of organic 
developments (-3%), the impact of the first-time  inclusion 
of acquisitions (+5%) and the negative impact of foreign 
currency exchange rate developments (-4%).
Gross profit  as a % of revenue increased by 0.4%-point 
from 24.9% in 2022 to 25.3% in 2023. The EMEA and 
Americas regions contributed to the improved gross profit  
margin in 2023. Gross profit  margins showed the usual 
level of differences  in margins per region, margins per 
product and margins per product market combination. 
Differences  between and within the regions are caused by 
local market circumstances, product mix variances, 
product availability, foreign currency fluctuations  and 
the impact of newly acquired businesses.

Integrated Report 2023
Operating EBITA
Operating EBITA is defined  as the result from operating 
activities before amortisation of intangible assets and 
excluding non-recurring income and expenses. It is one 
of the key performance indicators IMCD uses for 
monitoring the performance of its operating activities.
The bridge between result from operating activities and 
operating EBITA is as shown in the table 'Bridge operating 
EBITA'.
Operating EBITA declined by EUR 40.0 million (-7%) from 
EUR 554 million in 2022 to EUR 515 million in 2023. On 
a constant currency basis, the decline was 3%.
The decline in operating EBITA of 7% was the result 
of organic developments (-7%), the impact of the first-time  
inclusion of acquisitions completed in 2022 and 2023 
(+4%) and the negative impact of foreign currency 
exchange differences  (-4%).
The operating EBITA as a % of revenue declined by 0.4%-
point from 12.0% in 2022 to 11.6% in 2023. The regions 
showed the following operating EBITA margins. In EMEA 
the EBITA margin increased by 0.2%-point, from 12.3% 
in 2022 to 12.5% in 2023. The America segment showed 
a decline in EBITA margin of 1.2%-point from 12.2% 
in 2022 to 11.0% in 2023. In Asia-Pacific  the EBITA margin 
declined by 0.6%-point, from 14.5% in 2022 to 13.9% 
in 2023.
The conversion margin, defined  as operating EBITA as a 
% of gross profit,  declined by 2.5%-point from 48.3% in 
2022 to 45.8% in 2023. The decline in conversion margin 
is mainly the result of less gross profit  and the impact 
of the first  time inclusion of acquisitions with on average 
lower conversion margins. Organic increase in own cost 
was modest given the impact of higher than usual cost 
inflation  in most of the regions IMCD operates in.
Operating EBITA by operating segment
IMCD distinguishes the following operating segments:
• EMEA: all operating companies in Europe, Türkiye, 
Israel, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia 
and Africa
• America: all operating companies in the United 
States of America, Canada, Brazil, Puerto Rico, Chile, 
Argentina, Uruguay, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Costa 
Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador and Guatemala
• Asia-Pacific:  all operating companies in Australia, New 
Zealand, India, Bangladesh, China, Malaysia, Indonesia, 
Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Japan and 
South Korea
• Holding companies: all non-operating companies, 
including the head office  in Rotterdam and the regional 
offices  in Singapore and in the USA
The developments in the operating segments are 
described in the following sections.
EMEA
In 2023, the revenue in the EMEA region declined by 3% 
compared with 2022. On a constant currency basis, the 
revenue was in line with last year. The impact of the 
first-time  inclusion of acquisitions completed in 2022 and 
2023 was 3% and the negative impact of foreign currency 
rate developments was 3%. The acquisition impact of 
3% relates to the acquisition of Polychem (South Eastern 
Europe) and Evenlode (UK) in 2022 and Orange Chemicals 
(UK), ACM (Sweden), Tagra Distribution Division (Israel), 
KOI Products Solutions (Israel), CPS Oil-Tech (South Africa), 
and O&3 (UK) in 2023. The unfavourable developments 
of foreign currency exchange rates in the EMEA region, 
mainly relates to Türkiye.
Gross profit  remained stable at EUR 529.7 million in 
2023, and is the balance of acquisition growth of 
3% and a negative currency exchange impact of 3%. 
Despite the challenging market conditions, including 
the macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns, IMCD 
successfully gained new suppliers relationships and 
further expanded its relationships with existing suppliers 
in new territories and with additional business lines. 
Organic gross profit  development further included the 
usual variations in the product and customer mix.

Integrated Report 2023
Gross profit  margin increased by 0.9%-points, from 26.4% 
in 2022 to 27.3% in 2023. The gross profit  margin 
improvements are predominantly the result of margin 
improvement initiatives, changes in the product mix and 
the negative impact of acquisitions, with on average lower 
gross profit  margins, completed in 2022 and 2023.

In 2023, IMCD successfully completed six acquisition 
transactions in the EMEA region, Orange Chemicals 
(UK), ACM (Sweden), Tagra Distribution Division and KOI 
Products Solutions (Israel), CPS Oil-Tech (South Africa), 
O&3 (UK, PL, USA), adding new supplier relationships, 
complementary product portfolios and expertise to 
the group.
IMCD continued to optimise its supply chain network in 
2023, in order to enhance customer service levels and to 
reduce operating costs in the supply chain.
IMCD operates 28 application laboratories in EMEA. These 
laboratories are instrumental in exploring local markets 
and developing product applications for IMCD's business 
partners. In addition, laboratories are used for exchanging 
market and product expertise between IMCD, suppliers 
and customers on a local, regional and global level.
Operating EBITA declined by 2% from EUR 246.6 million in 
2022 to EUR 242.0 million in 2023. The organic decline in 
operating EBITA was the result of organic developments 
(-1%), the impact of the first-time  inclusion of acquisitions 
completed in 2022 and 2023 (+3%) and the negative 
impact of foreign currency exchange differences  (-4%). 
Operating EBITA as a % of revenue increased by 0.2%-
point, from 12.3% in 2022 to 12.5% in 2023.
The conversion margin declined by 0.8%-points, from 
46.5% in 2022 to 45.7% in 2023. The development of 
the conversion margin is the result of higher gross profit  
margins being more than offset  by higher own costs. IMCD 
continues to focus on revenue and gross profit  growth, 
combined with ensuring resource efficiency. 
As at the end of 2023, the number of full-time employees 
in EMEA was 2,006 compared with 1,782 as at the end of 
2022. The increase in the number of full-time employees 
is due to additional staff  being hired to fill  vacancies and 
to strengthen the technical expertise, and to the impact of 
acquisitions completed in 2023 (98 full-time employees).
Americas
In the Americas segment, revenue was EUR 1,413.2 million 
in 2023 compared with EUR 1,591.7 million in 2022 
(-11%). In 2023, organic revenue decline was 14% and 
growth as a result of acquisitions completed in 2022, 
Polyorganic (Brazil), Quelaris (Colombia, Costa Rica and 
Peru) and Promaplast (USA and Mexico) and in 2023, 
Allianz (Colombia), Sachs (Puerto Rico) and MAPRIN (Chile) 
was 5%. The unfavourable developments of foreign 
currency exchange rates in the America region, resulted 
in a negative currency exchange impact of 2% on revenues 
in 2023.
In 2023, the America segment reported a gross profit  
decrease of EUR 42.3 million (-11%) to EUR 340.4 million, 
compared with EUR 382.7 million in 2022. The decline 
in gross profit  was the result of an organic decline 
(-13%), the impact of the first-time  inclusion of acquired 
companies (+4%) and negative foreign currency exchange 
results (-2%).
Gross profit  margin increased by 0.1%-points, from 24.0% 
in 2022 to 24.1% in 2023. The gross profit  margin 
improvements are predominantly the result of margin 
improvement initiatives, changes in the product mix and 
the negative impact of acquisitions completed in 2022 
and 2023.
In 2023, IMCD successfully completed four acquisitions 
in the America region, of which three transactions 
were closed in 2023. The closed transactions relates to 
Allianz (Colombia), Sachs (Puerto Rico), MAPRIN (Chile). 
In addition to the closed transactions, IMCD signed an 
agreement to acquire the distribution business of Joli 
Foods (Colombia).

Integrated Report 2023
Operating EBITA declined by EUR 39.9 million (-20%) from 
EUR 194.9 million in 2022 to EUR 155.0 million in 2023. 
The organic decline in operating EBITA was the result 
of organic developments (-22%), the impact of the first- 
time  inclusion of acquisitions completed in 2022 and 
2023 (+4%) and the negative impact of foreign currency 
exchange differences  (-2%).
Operating EBITA margin declined by 1.2%-point from 
12.2% in 2022 to 11.0% in 2023. The conversion margin 
was 45.5% in 2023 compared with a relatively high 
conversion margin of 50.9% in 2022 (2021: 45.1%). The 
development of the conversion margin is the result of 
a combination of slightly lower own costs that could 
not compensate for the decline in gross profit  and the 
negative impact of acquisitions with on average lower 
conversion margins.
The number of full-time employees in the America 
increased from 1,189 as at the end of 2022 to 1,301 as 
at the end of 2023. This increase includes 83 additional 
full-time employees as a result of acquisitions in 2023.
Asia-Pacific
The Asia-Pacific  region delivered strong growth 
numbers in 2023. Revenue increased by 8% from 
EUR 1,003.4 million in 2022 to EUR 1,086.9 million in 
2023. Revenue growth in 2023, consists of organic growth 
of 1%, growth as a result of acquisitions completed in 
2022: Syntec (China), RPL Trading (Australia and New 
Zealand), Aquatech (China), Kuni Chemical (Japan), Welex 
(China) and Parkash (India) and in 2023: Sanrise (China), 
Tradeimpex (India) and Needfill  (South Korea), Brylchem 
Group (Singapore and Vietnam) of 14%, and negative 
currency exchange rate developments of 7%.
In 2023, gross profit  increased by 8%, of which 6% relates 
to organic growth and 9% is the result of the first  time 
inclusion of businesses acquired in 2022 and 2023. The 
unfavourable developments of foreign currency exchange 
rates in Asia-Pacific  resulted in a negative currency 
exchange impact of 7% on gross profit  in 2023. The gross 
profit  margin declined by 0.2%-points from 23.4% in 2022 
to 23.2% in 2023. The gross profit  margin decline is mainly 
the result of the impact of the first  time inclusion of 
acquired businesses with gross margins lower than IMCD's 
average, combined with changes in the product mix and 
gross margin improvement initiatives.

In 2023, IMCD continued with the execution of its selective 
acquisition strategy, which led to eight acquisitions in the 
Asia-Pacific  region, of which four transactions were closed 
in 2023.
In addition to the transactions closed in 2023 (Sanrise, 
Tradeimpex, Needfill  and Brylchem Group), in 2023 IMCD 
signed agreements to acquire the shares of CJ Shah 
(India), RBD (China), Valuetree (India) and Euro Chemo-
Pharma/Biofresh (Malaysia).
Compared with 2022, operating EBITA in Asia-Pacific  
increased by EUR 5.5 million (+4%) to EUR 150.6 million in 
2023. The organic growth was 5% and acquisition-driven 
growth of the operating EBITA of 6%. Currency exchange 
rate developments negatively impacted operating EBITA 
by 7%.
Operating EBITA as a % of revenue decreased by 0.6%-
points from 14.5% in 2022 to 13.9% in 2023. The 
conversion margin declined by 2.2%-points to 59.6% in 
2023. Compared with 2022, the decline in both the 
operating EBITA margin and the conversion margin in 
2023 is mainly the result of acquisitions.
The number of full time employees in the Asia-Pacific  
region increased by 5%, from 1,245 at the end of 2022 
to 1,306 at the end of 2023. Considering the impact of the 
acquisitions completed in 2023 (109 FTE), the number of 
full-time employees decreased by 48.

The bridge between Operating EBITA, one of IMCD's 
key performance indicators used for monitoring the 
performance of the operating activities, the result from

Amortisation of intangible assets
Amortisation of intangible assets refers to non-
cash expenses, relating to the amortisation of 
supplier relationships, distribution rights and other 
intangible assets.
The amortisation of other intangible assets declined from 
EUR 81.5 million in 2022 to EUR 80.9 million in 2023, which 
is the result of combination of acquisitions completed 
in 2022 and 2023 and less amortisation due to fully 
amortised assets.
Non-recurring income and expenses
In 2023, non-recurring income and expenses amounted to 
EUR -5.1 million compared with EUR -11.2 million in 2022. 
The non-recurring expenses in 2023 relate to the costs of 
realised and non-realised acquisitions, net result on the 
sale of a warehouse in the USA, and costs of other one-off  
adjustments to the organisation.
Net finance costs
The net finance  costs consist of the following items:

Net finance  costs were EUR -25.4 million in 2023 
compared with EUR -25.9 million in 2022. The main drivers 
of the decrease in net finance  costs of EUR 0.4 million 
were increased interest expenses on financial  liabilities 
(EUR -20.8 million) and positive results related to 
adjustments to the fair value of contingent considerations 
(EUR 22.3 million). The main drivers of the positive results 
regarding the changes in the deferred considerations 
relate to Megasetia and Sanrise. Less favourable result 
developments of both entities compared to assumptions 
used in the calculation of the initial value of the deferred 
consideration, have led to a decrease in the fair value of 
the deferred considerations.
Income tax
In 2023, corporate income tax expenses decreased by

(EUR 484.0 million in 2023 and EUR 517.3 million in 2022) 
was 24.7% compared with 25.2% in 2022.
The decrease in income tax expenses in 2023 is mainly 
due to the lower results of the group. The restructuring 
and integration of acquired businesses together with 
the results of the sales of real estate, led to a non-
recurring income tax charge of EUR 0.3 million in 2023 
(EUR 0.4 million income in 2022).
Earnings per share and cash earnings per share
Earnings per share declined by EUR 0.36 (-7%) from 
EUR 5.50 in 2022 to EUR 5.13 in 2023. Cash earnings 
per share, calculated as earnings per share before 
amortisation of intangible assets, net of tax, divided by the

Dividend
The Company has a dividend policy with the intention 
to pay an annual dividend in the range of 25% to 35% 
of the adjusted net income to be paid out in cash or in 
shares. Adjusted net income is defined  as the reported 
result for the year plus non-cash amortisation charges 
(net of tax). The outcome may be adjusted for material 
non-recurring items.
In 2023, IMCD realised adjusted net income of 
EUR 364.5 million (EUR 6.41 per share), compared with 
EUR 386.0 million (EUR 6.78 per share) in 2022.
The dividend proposal of IMCD is based on a combination 
of maintaining room for further acquisition growth 
combined with assuring reasonable leverage levels, 
facilitating IMCD's long-term growth strategy. For the 
financial  year 2023 a dividend of EUR 2.24 in cash per 
share will be proposed to the Annual General Meeting. 
Compared with EUR 2.37 per share for the financial  year 
2022, this means an decrease of EUR 0.13 per share (-5%).
Approval of the dividend proposal by the Annual 
General Meeting will lead to a dividend distribution of 
EUR 127.7 million in cash (2022: EUR 135.1 million), which 
is 35% of the net result for 2023 adjusted for non-cash 
amortisation charges, net of tax (2022: 35%).

Free cash flow 554.2 434.4 119.8
Cash conversion margin 105.3% 76.9% 28.5%
Free cash flow  is defined  as operating EBITDA excluding 
non-cash share-based payment expenses, less lease 
payments, plus or less changes in operational working 
capital, less capital expenditures. Free cash flow  increased 
by EUR 119.8 million from EUR 434.4 million in 2022 
to EUR 554.2 million in 2023. The cash conversion 
margin is defined  as free cash flow  as a percentage of 
adjusted operating EBITDA; adjusted operating EBITDA is 
the operating EBITDA adjusted for non-cash share-based 
payments and lease premiums. The cash conversion 
margin increased by 28.5%-points from 76.9% in 2022 to 
105.3% in 2023.
The increase in the cash conversion margin in 2023 is 
the result of a combination of lower adjusted operating 
EBITDA (EUR -39 million), higher net capital expenditures 
(EUR -2.0 million) and lower working capital investments 
(EUR 160.8 million) compared with 2022. The divestment 
in operational working capital in 2023, which excludes 
additional working capital as a result of acquisitions 
completed in 2023, amounts to EUR 37.6 million 
(2022: EUR -123.1 million). The consolidated change in 
operational working capital is the accumulated total of 
the monthly operational working capital changes in local 
currencies translated into EUR, using the monthly average 
exchange rates.
The decreased investment in operational working capital 
in 2023 is the result of the relatively lower level of 
business activities in more than offsetting  slightly higher 
net working capital days in 2023. IMCD continues to 
maintain stringent net working capital management.
Net capital expenditure (acquisition of property, plant and 
equipment minus proceeds from disposals of property, 
plant and equipment and intangible assets) was mainly 
related to investments in the ICT infrastructure, office  
furniture and technical, warehouse and office  equipment 
and to divestments of properties and amounted to 
EUR 9.7 million in 2023 (2022: EUR 7.7 million). The 
increase is driven by the increased size of the overall 
operations. IMCD continues to maintain an asset-light 
business model.

and negative foreign currency impacts (EUR -41.2 million).
Net working capital
Net working capital is defined  as inventories, trade and 
other receivables less trade payables and other payables. 
Net working capital decreased by EUR 5.7 million (-1%) 
from EUR 770.1 million as at the end of 2022 to 
EUR 764.4 million as at 31 December 2023. The decrease 
in net working capital of EUR 5.7 million is the result of 
the lower level of business activities in 2023 compared 
with last year, the normalisation impact of the relatively 
high working capital levels in 2022, the impact of 
exchange rate differences  on year-end balance sheet 
positions (EUR -18.8 million) and the impact of acquisitions 
completed in 2023 (EUR 57.0 million).

Year-end working capital days increased by 2 days to 61, 
compared with the end of 2022 (59 days). The increase 
in net working capital days as at year end 2023 is partly 
driven by the impact of the acquisition of companies 
with higher than IMCD's average working capital days, in 
particular in the Asia-Pacific  region.
Monitoring working capital positions is a permanent 
focus of management and IMCD has various processes, 
procedures and tools in place to optimise working capital.
Financing
IMCD aims to maintain a capital structure that offers  
flexibility  and enables IMCD to cover its potential financial  
requirements and to execute its organic growth and 
acquisition strategy. The corporate treasury team at 
the head office  in Rotterdam manages liquidity and 
interest risks.
On 8 February 2023, IMCD completed the refinancing  of 
its multi-currency revolving credit facility. The new facility, 
with a maturity data of 8 February 2029, amounts to 
EUR 600 million and can be drawn in EUR and USD as 
well as, to an agreed sub-limit, in AUD and GBP. The 
credit revolving facility has an interest margin dependent 
on external credit ratings. For the new revolving credit 
facility a maximum leverage of 3.75 times EBITDA (with 
a spike period maximum of 4.25), tested semi-annually 
is applicable.
On 18 September 2023, IMCD issued an EUR 500 million 
rated corporate bond loan with institutional investors. 
This five-year  senior unsecured bond loan matures on 
18 September 2028 and has a fixed  coupon of 4.875%. 
The bond loan is traded on the EURO MTF market of 
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The proceeds of the 
bond loan issue is used for general corporate purposes, 
including the refinancing  of existing indebtedness.
Net debt is defined  as the total of current and non-current 
loans and borrowings, short term financial  liabilities minus 
cash and cash equivalents.
As at the end of 2023, net debt was EUR 1,285.6 million 
compared with EUR 1,026.9 million as at 31 December 
2022. The increase in net debt is predominantly the 
balance of positive and healthy cash flows  from operating 
activities, more than offset  by cash outflows  as a result 
of acquisition-related payments of EUR 367.6 million 
and a dividend payment of EUR 135.1 million in 
2023. Furthermore, net debt includes EUR 102.9 million 
(31 December 2022: EUR 273.6 million) deferred and 
contingent considerations related and EUR 243.8 million 
short term liability (see note 29 to the financial  
statements) related to acquisitions completed in 2023 and 
prior years.
As at 31 December 2023, the adjusted leverage ratio 
(net debt/operating EBITDA ratio including full-year impact 
of acquisitions) was 2.3 times EBITDA (31 December 
2022: 1.7). Actual leverage, calculated on the basis of 
the definitions  used in the IMCD loan documents as at 
31 December 2023, was 1.7 times EBITDA (31 December 
2022: 1.2).
As per 31 December 2023 a leverage covenant is 
applicable to the Group's revolving credit facilities. For the 
revolving credit facility of EUR 600 million, a maximum 
leverage of 3.75 times EBITDA is applicable (with a spike 
period maximum of 4.25), tested semi-annually. As at 
31 December 2023, the actual leverage of 1.7 times 
EBITDA is well below the applicable maximum leverages.

IMCD is a diverse group of 4,736 men 
and women who live and work in more 
than 60 countries in Europe, Middle 
East & Africa (EMEA), the Americas 
and in the Asia-Pacific region (APAC). 
IMCD is very proud of its people and 
culture and considers them to be its 
most important asset by far. It is easy to 
explain why: the value of the company 
lies in the commercial partnerships 
with principals and customers and, in 
the quality and the technical expertise 
of the people who manage those 
relationships, plus in the people who 
lead and support them in various 
functional areas.
In the very technical world of speciality chemicals and 
ingredients, our management approach is to operate 
as a people-centric, professional services firm,  where 
highly qualified  key people in a flat  organisation with 
locally delegated decision-making, make the difference  
for suppliers, customers, and each other. IMCD aims to 
minimise bureaucracy and encourages entrepreneurship. 
IMCD competes with large chemical and ingredient 
producers for talent and needs to attract, hire and retain 
very capable and highly educated individuals, but also 
train and develop them to get the very best out of 
everybody. Our Business Groups range from industrial 
like coatings & construction or lubricants, to life sciences 
such as beauty & personal care therefore we want to 
provide jobs and careers for men and women alike. 
For IMCD Diversity is important to be successful. All 
this in a business environment where we continue to 
acquire new companies and integrate them quickly. In 
2023, we acquired thirteen companies with 290 new 
employees. Including these acquired employees we hired 
1,236 new employees. Our culture is the glue that keeps 
the talent and the new businesses together; it cuts 
across geographies and helps to integrate newly acquired 
businesses quickly and it ensures that IMCD has winning 
teams all over the world.
Our IMCD Culture and Values explained
At IMCD we are committed to offering  our customers and 
principals long-term value through dedicated commercial 
teams with expertise of chemicals and ingredients. As 
a global leader in the industry, we operate in over 60 
countries across the world and we strive to do that in a 
consistent, recognisable way that reflects  what we stand 
for and set us apart so that all our stakeholders be it 
investors, employees, principals or customers know what 
they can expect from us. Our culture is the same across 
the IMCD world to ensure the long-term value for all 
stakeholders. Our values are non-negotiable promises we 
make to the world – the principles we stick to no matter 
what. We believe more in our values as the compass for 
behaviour than in detailed bureaucratic rule books.
We have five  values that we apply to decisions and actions 
we take. Firstly, we are Entrepreneurial meaning we think 
like owners by creating long term value, taking initiative,

generating new and novel business opportunities, and 
being self-motivated to drive the business forward. 
Secondly, Partnership, we work transparently as true 
partners of our principals and customers and we 
base these relationships on trust, confidence,  credibility 
and mutual long-term benefits.  We nurture long term 
relationships rather than focusing on one-off  quick 
wins. Thirdly, Freedom to act, we have appropriate 
freedom to act, with a can-do attitude so we can make 
various decisions independently, move fast, be efficient  
and capitalise on business opportunities. We take local 
circumstances into account, we don’t have a one rule fits  
all approach. Fourth, Integrity and trust is something 
we expect on the highest level from each other. Lastly, 
Financial Discipline is key meaning we are aware of the 
financial  impact of all our business decisions, and we carry 
out accurate transparent financial  planning, monitoring, 
accounting and reporting via our core IT systems.
Although company values are mainly an internal matter, 
we expect that our customers and principals will see 
IMCD employees who enjoy what they do and, who act 
commonly, irrespective of borders and background. We 
apply the values in multiple ways. Firstly, they serve 
as a good starting point to explain to employees in 
newly acquired businesses how things are done at IMCD 
and what type of behaviour we expect. Secondly, we 
explain to new hires in existing businesses how IMCD 
functions. Thirdly, values also serve as guiding principles 
for managers and other employees when they have 
to take difficult  decisions about customers, contracts, 
recruitment, internal promotions and more.
At least once per year the topic of IMCD’s culture 
and values is discussed with the Supervisory Board 
members. The Management Board and Global HR 
Director are responsible for the maintenance of these 
values in all existing and newly acquired businesses. 
Management behaviours that are not aligned with our 
values will be corrected to ensure that the values come 
alive. There is the ability to discuss and report actual 
or suspected misconduct or irregularities, either via 
regular management channels or via our ethical hotline 
-also anonymously.
In a recent evaluation of our IMCD Culture & Values 
we started to discuss the importance of continuous 
improvement as an additional descriptor of success. We 
operate in a changing environment and aspire to be the 
best global Chemical Distributor, therefore we strengthen 
what is working well and improve what is not working. 
Fast best practice sharing and effective  training programs, 
such as commercial excellence, are tools we have 
already implemented to make the concept of continuous 
improvement come to live and potentially become an 
additional part of our culture and company values.
People Goals and Objectives achieved in 2023
The overall People-related goals for IMCD were, firstly,  to 
attract the necessary quantity and quality of new staff  to 
enable business growth in all regions. By 2023, we added 
1,236 new starters to the company, including acquisitions.
Secondly, to ensure a gender balance in the IMCD 
management sub top. This has been defined  as the 
total number of positions of the country management 
teams and regional head offices.  This group consists of 
412 managers of which 182 (44%) women. Furthermore, 
during 2023 IMCD had 84 openings in this group of which 
40 (48%) were filled  by women. IMCD is getting near parity 
in the management sub top. Our goal was to appoint 
at least 40% of women in sub top open positions but 
we overachieved with 48% female appointments made 
in 2023.
Thirdly, a talent management goal. The above mentioned 
IMCD management sub top consists of two distinct 
groups. The first  one is the group of customer facing 
managers with a commercial, digital, profit  & loss (P&L) 
responsibility. This group comprises of 239 individuals 
of which 31% women. The second group contains of 
functional staff  and support managers such as finance,  
communications, legal and HR. It is easier to find  good 
female talent in the last group. However, companies in 
general and IMCD as well, need well filled  talent pipelines 
to be able to source and promote talent from within. 
These commercial roles are important feeder positions 
for more senior roles such as country managing director. 
Therefore we had a goal to fill  more than 33% of 
open postitions in the group of commercial managers by 
women. In 2023 IMCD appointed women in 34% of these 
open positions, which was a slight overachievement of the 
goal of 33%.
Goal four was to measure employee engagement and we 
have set a goal to achieve at least 72% favourable overall 
employee engagement. In the last survey, that was held in 
the fourth quarter of 2022 we were pleased with a very 
high 85% participation rate and 72% overall favourable 
engagement. At the same time, the questions regarding 
our company values came out on top: 89% of our staff  
know our values and only 2% replied that they did not. 
This is an encouraging outcome, especially given the fact 
that we on-boarded more than 2,400 new employees in 
the two years 2022 and 2023 together.
Regarding Training & Development, we decided to step 
up our specialised training programs and had as goal to 
ensure at least 6 training hours per employee. In 2023 
we overachieved with 13.85 average hours of training 
per employee, compared to last year 5.45 hours so 
254% more.
All of the above goals can only be achieved if IMCD 
provides a safe and secure working environment where 
engaged employees know that the company strives for 
zero workplace incidents with work-related injuries. We

Risks and opportunities associated with our 
human capital
In achieving its objectives, IMCD faces risks and 
uncertainties, including People & Culture related risks. 
IMCD strives to identify and control those risks and 
uncertainties as early as possible. Risk management is 
an essential element in IMCD's corporate governance 
and is embedded in the company's business process. 
IMCD believes that the broad geographic diversity of 
its business, active in more than 60 countries and 
no country is more than 10% of the total headcount, 
reduces these risks. On top of that, IMCD’s well-structured 
risk management process, continuously monitored by 
the Supervisory Board, Management Board, Corporate 
Control, Internal Audit and by regional and local 
management, is designed to manage the residual risks in 
a transparent and controlled manner (reference is made 
to chapter 13 Risk factors and risk management).
The main People & Culture related risks and the way 
IMCD manages these risks are further described in 13 Risk 
factors and risk management.

A new unified employee value 
proposition showcases the prominent 
role of innovation and autonomy at 
IMCD to attract the best and most 
qualified talent from around the world 
amid a widening global skills gap.
IMCD has a reputation for fostering a value-driven 
employee culture that prioritises entrepreneurship and 
the freedom to act. Communicating those distinctive 
attributes to the talent ecosystem has become more 
important than ever as the skills gap widens and a new 
generation enters the workforce.
By 2025, Gen Z will comprise 27% of the workforce in 
OECD countries, according to the World Economic Forum. 
The generation prioritises projects and employers that 
correspond to their values.
IMCD’s new Employee Value Proposition (EVP) emphasises 
its exceptional work environment to the global talent pool 
amid a scarcity of skilled professionals. The employer 
branding campaign was launched in the first quarter of 
2024 after a year of intensive preparation. 
It defines IMCD’s unique offerings, benefits and values, 
and highlights employees as an integral part of IMCD’s 
success, inviting candidates to explore their potential with 
the company.
Building out the campaign was a multi-step process 
involving employees from around the world. Following 
Cultivating our greatest asset 
research across offices in 60 countries, a cross-functional 
workgroup of international business leaders, 
communications professionals, and human resources 
teams defined a compelling EVP in line with IMCD’s 
business strategy. Key components – including around 
career development, work environment and recognition 
– were identified. 
The resulting three-step campaign accentuates IMCD’s 
leadership in speciality chemicals and ingredients, while 
aligning with our core values: freedom to act, 
entrepreneurship and opportunities. 
The campaign represents a departure from traditional 
approaches by reimagining the hiring roadmap, 
strategically integrating different touchpoints along the 
employee journey. The progressive approach is supported 
by a comprehensive and consistent toolkit of assets and 
marketing tactics and is being implemented across 
high-traffic locations online and offline. 
Central to the campaign is a set of internal success stories 
that will demonstrate life at IMCD, and how employees 
have the autonomy to create a world of opportunities.
The EVP has been designed for use over several years. Key 
performance metrics will consider how the new material is 
used in each country, changes in application volumes, and 
the rate at which vacancies are filled. The campaign was 
first trialled internally, where it won acclaim from 
employees. 
“At IMCD, we recognise 
the imperative to 
proactively differentiate 
our identity in the global 
labour market. Our new 
campaign is driven by a deep understanding that 
attracting and retaining the best and most qualified talent 
that aligns with our corporate culture provides us with a 
significant competitive advantage,” said Ben van 
Stekelenburg, Global HR Director, IMCD.
Marnie Kontovraki, Group Communications and Brand 
Director, IMCD, said, “The new EVP seamlessly aligns with 
our brand essence, reflecting our commitment to 
innovation, diversity, and employee empowerment. This 
integration enhances our brand identity, creating a 
cohesive narrative to resonate with our workforce and the 
wider market.”

IMCD takes climate protection seriously 
and proactively responds to risks 
and opportunities relating to climate 
change together with suppliers and 
customers and in its logistics. IMCD 
continuously seeks to reduce the 
environmental impact of its operations. 
We work on optimising our daily 
operations and focus on reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions from our 
own activities and in our supply chain. 
We engage with third-party logistic 
service providers to reduce Scope 3 
emissions. In addition, IMCD ensures 
the highest standards are applied for 
its waste handling and disposal to avoid 
environmental pollution.
We care about our Planet and how we create 
value for the environment
IMCD's direct environmental footprint is limited given 
its asset-light business model and limited own supply 
chain operations. Nevertheless, reducing its overall 
environmental impact is essential for IMCD and its 
stakeholders. Performing well on this topic is important 
as we are to set an example for our upstream 
and downstream business partners. This gives us the 
credibility and leverage to engage with them to address 
our core focus areas, supply chain decarbonisation and 
sustainable solutions. Embedding good environmental 
practices in our business also makes IMCD an attractive 
employer for talent.
IMCD recognises the impact of its activities on the 
environment, and we report on three topics that surfaced 
during our materiality assessment, namely:
• supply chain decarbonisation (Scope 3 GHG emissions)
• climate strategy
• eco-efficient  operations (Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, 
energy, water, waste-water and waste management)
In 2019, IMCD set a target to deliver a 15% reduction on 
its GHG emissions intensity per operating EBITDA (please 
refer to Note 3.1.1 to the Sustainability statements for 
the methodology of emission intensity calculation), by 
2024. This target is applicable for total emissions and 
consequently for own emissions (Scope 1 and 2) as well 
as for Scope 3 emissions.
The following table summarises our GHG emissions 
intensity (Scope 1 and 2 and for Scope 3) since the 
baseline year 2019 to date.

In 2023 IMCD's own emissions (Scope 1 and 2) intensity 
increased by 11% from 20 in 2022 to 23, mainly due 
to a combination of increased absolute emissions and a 
decline in EBITDA. Compared with the base line year 2019, 
our own emissions intensity reduced by 58%. Changes in 
the volume of own emissions are mainly caused by the 
impact of acquisitions, optimising the energy consumption 
and types of energy used, as well as by outsourcing 
logistic operations, following IMCD's asset-light strategy. 
The total energy consumption within the organisation 
(Scope 1 and 2) increased by 4% in 2023 and declined 
by 18% since 2019. Reference is made to note 3.1 to the 
Sustainability statements.
Scope 3 emission intensity decreased by 2%, from 777 
in 2022, to 760 in 2023. Compared with baseline year 
2019, Scope 3 emissions intensity decreased by 8%, which 
is the result of a combination of optimisations in the 
supply chain, the impact of acquisitions completed since 
2019 and adding new group entities to the scope of 
the emissions calculations. For the purpose of Scope 
3 emissions calculation, all entities with a full year of 
transactional data in our global ERP system are included.
Supply chain decarbonisation
Road transportation decarbonisation is critical for 
decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating 
climate change. All IMCD companies onboarded onto our 
global ERP system make use of our emissions dashboard, 
which provides insight into the carbon footprint of our 
shipments. The calculation method applied is compliant 
with the GHG Protocol. The utilisation of data analytics 
helps in the identification  of potential for efficiency  
improvements and emission reductions.
Collaboration throughout the supply chain, as well as 
technical improvements, will be critical in attaining 
sustainable and low-carbon logistics. We work with our 
third-party logistic service providers (3PLs) to optimise or 
combine several modes of transportation (e.g., truck, rail, 
ship) to maximise efficiency  and to reduce emissions. As 
an example, we established a consolidation centre in 2023 
to combine many shipments from Europe before ultimate 
delivery in LATAM, minimising the number of individual 
trips. There is room for further improvement, hence this 
model will be scaled up in 2024.
Although we rely on industry developments by our 
3PLs to electrify the trucking industry by using electric 
trucks powered by batteries or hydrogen fuel cells, we 
do encourage the use of biofuels or synthetic fuels 
produced from renewable sources to power trucks 
and other vehicles in the logistics chain. In 2024 we 
will put more focus on this topic in the engagement 
with our 3PLs. In 2023, for the first  time, we have 
trained our logistics personnel on ESG, sustainable 
procurement, environmentally friendly operations, and 
the importance of lowering carbon emissions. We urge 
our logistics personnel and employees to suggest ways 
to improve logistics efficiency  and sustainability. For 
further information on our 2023 activities in Supply 
Chain Decarbonisation, see Note 3.1 in the Notes to the 
Sustainability statements.

consumption, and waste-water management, although 
these components are not material for our business and 
their impact is insignificant  compared to manufacturers. 
IMCD does not operate in or adjacent to protected areas 
nor areas of high biodiversity, therefore our impact on 
biodiversity is considered limited. Nonetheless, we strive 
to contribute to the protection of biodiversity where 
possible in our own activities, and encouraging our value 
chain to respect it and be transparent whenever risks and 
impacts are identified. 
IMCD has influence  over the measures applied to its 
own operations. As a result of this, during 2023 IMCD 
was able to further improve on this material topic as 
part of our actions towards our 2030 strategy. The 
following developments represented IMCD's highlights on 
our operational environment.
• Implementation of energy-efficient  technologies and 
emission reduction initiatives: five  of our sites 
introduced energy conservation and emissions 
reduction measures in 2023. The measures were 
focused on reducing consumption of electricity by 
installing solar panels, change lighting to LED, etc. In 
addition, 5 sites moved to a more energy-efficient  
office:  IMCD Spain, IMCD France, IMCD Nordics, IMCD 
Italy, and IMCD India (Mumbai).
• Continued shift towards renewable energy sources: 
as of 2023, 15% of the total electricity consumption 
is from renewable sources, where 8% of it is from 
the locations that are on 100% renewable mix 
(EMEA: IMCD Baltics, IMCD Switzerland; Americas: 
IMCD Uruguay, IMCD Brazil). In addition, the share of 
electric passenger cars in our fleet  increased from 28 
owned or leased electric in 2022 to 65 (6% of total 
passenger cars) in 2023. Furthermore, at the end of 
2023 we had 96 electric warehouse vehicles (68% of 
the total warehouse vehicles) versus 90 electric vehicles 
(65%) in 2022. The portion of electric and hybrid 
vehicles comprised of 20% out of total passenger and 
warehouse vehicles leased or owned.
• Improved monitoring and reporting system resulting 
in better quality of reporting data: 83% of the 
energy consumption within the organisation reported 
on confirmed  primary data, compared with 79% in 
2022. In addition, due to the implementation of our 
new and enhanced tools, water consumption and 
waste production calculations have been standardised 
throughout the organisation.
As a lesson learned from past years on this topic, IMCD 
strived to improve its sustainability data management 
system by developing its emissions calculations in-house 
and facilitating calculation templates to reporting local 
entities. That way, IMCD has increased its reporting 
efficiency  and reliability, and has increased the human 
resources dedicated to the data collection and analysis. 
The latest reporting standards have been updated and 
compiled in IMCD's 2023 Integrated Reporting Manual, 
while our main commitments towards eco-efficient  
operations can be found in IMCD Group's Global HSEQR 
Policy, both of internal use.
For more details of water consumption, waste 
management, raw materials usage, please see Note 3.2 
in the Notes to the Sustainability statements.
In order to keep track of progress in long-term value 
we create for our planet and environment, as well our 
stakeholders, management set the following targets and 
KPIs for 2023 and onwards.

Contributing towards a more  
sustainable future with bio-syngas  
increasingly used to support the purification of waste and 
bio-based gas streams. 
  
IMCD’s specialist team worked closely with the customer 
to understand their processing requirements and 
proposed several purification and drying agents.  
 
The first product tested successfully separated out the 
hydrogen and oxygen, but the carbon dioxide remained in 
the waste gas stream in significant amounts.
By collaborating with the supplier, IMCD proposed an 
additional solution allowing to successfully separated the 
hydrogen and oxygen gases were from the bio-syngas.
These are now considered by the customer as potential 
value products that could be sold to the market for 
traditional use.
This compares to the original plan of releasing these 
non-polluting gases to the atmosphere. The customer 
expects to introduce the complete  
solution to the market in 2024.
“Supporting the energy transition is a top priority for 
IMCD. Our team tracks trends on sustainability and 
emission reductions, as well as changes in legislative 
requirements. With the bio-syngas project, the team made 
a crucial contribution in helping our customer bring a 
compelling new solution to market and in shaping a 
sustainable future for all,” commented François 
Pouponnot, Business Development Director Energy, IMCD 
Lubricants & Energy.
Aligned with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development 
Goal 12, which focuses on responsible consumption and 
production, the project will support the development of 
energy from bio-syngas as a sustainable alternative to gas 
from fossil fuel sources.   
  
Francois 
In a recent project IMCD Lubricants & 
Energy helped a customer create a new 
sustainable business line, which 
advances the circular economy and 
supports the clean energy transition.  
IMCD Lubricants & Energy provided technical support to a 
circular economy project to purify and separate the 
components of bio-sourced syngas.   
 
IMCD’s customer, a leader in green fuels, produces 
equipment to transform bio-sourced and bio-waste 
materials into hydrogen, syngas, or liquid fuels that are 
used to generate green power, speeding up the clean 
energy transition.  
The process starts with the gasification of biomass 
materials which generates a mixture of gases including 
carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and oxygen, 
referred to as “Bio-syngas”. The customer’s challenge was 
to separate oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide from 
the “bio-syngas” at a purity where the gases could be used 
as raw materials in industries such as energy and 
chemicals. Success would result in a new business line for 
the company.  
  
IMCD’s Lubricants & Energy portfolio offers various 
speciality chemicals that can support the processing and 
purification of gas streams. This includes adsorbents, 
purification media and additives. These solutions were 
originally developed for oil and gas refineries but are

we are well equipped to (co-)create 
and promote Sustainable Solutions that 
can help address societal changes 
and challenges, from increased climate-
change awareness to the transition 
towards a more circular economy.
We are committed to the 
safe and reliable handling of 
chemicals and ingredients, ensuring 
that our warehouse operations 
and transportation meet all 
applicable regulations.
To safeguard responsible ESG practices, 
we promote ethical and sustainable 
purchasing practices towards our 
suppliers and service partners.
6.1 Sustainable solutions
IMCD’s Sustainable Solutions programme is coordinated 
through its market focused Business Groups. Reflecting  on 
this initiative, it began with a pilot project in Advanced 
Materials in 2021 to identify and tag within IMCD’s 
global IT platform, and promote sustainable accelerators 
(meaning substances, products or formulations). from 
within the portfolio. The programme has since been 
extended to all Business Groups and includes the use 
of IMCD’s laboratories to create sustainable formulations 
which either contain a sustainable product or can be 
linked to an SDG, for example a formulation which results 
in lower water or electricity usage.
To roll-out and drive forward the various initiatives around 
sustainable solutions throughout IMCD, we established 
an IMCD Sustainable Solutions Taskforce, in which each 
Business Group is represented.
All Business Groups continued the portfolio analysis 
during 2023. This is a complex and time-consuming 
process, for which IMCD uses internal and external 
knowledge centres to assess sustainability claims on 
products. With a dynamic and constantly evolving 
portfolio this remains a work-in-progress. The identified  
sustainable accelerators will be featured in IMCD's country 
websites as well as digital sales and buyer enablement 
tool which is scheduled for launch in 2024.
In 2023, we re-assessed our alignment with the UN SDGs 
(see Note 6 in the Notes to the Sustainability statements). 
In this exercise, we evaluated through which activities 
we can actively contribute to the SDGs ourselves, and 
where we can use our influence  on business partners to 
drive positive change. The perspectives gained, have also 
led us to rethink the aim for the Sustainable Solutions 
programme. As a next step to evolve the programme, we 
will focus more on the activities within our control: (i) the

work done in our laboratories and by our technical teams 
to create and (co-) development sustainable formulations, 
and (ii) the marketing and promotion of such sustainable 
formulations and products.
Performance indicators that we will set up and track 
as of 2024 are (i) the number of laboratory activities 
that lead to a sustainable formulation (ii) the number 
of marketing campaigns and events that promote a 
sustainable formulation or product. The review of the 
Sustainable Solutions strategy will be discussed with the 
Supervisory Board in April 2024. The further year will be 
used to set a baseline, after which targets for the mid and 
long term can be defined. 
More information is provided in Note 4.1 in the Notes to 
the Sustainability statements.
6.2 Sustainable Procurement
During 2023, IMCD’s sustainable procurement strategy 
has focused on the enhancement of existing 
global procurement procedures, whilst leveraging new 
partnerships and procurement tools. IMCD joined the 
Together for Sustainability (TfS) initiative in November 
2022, and continues to work in partnership with Ecovadis, 
using the Ecovadis platform to help build a clearer 
picture of ESG performance, across both product and 
logistics suppliers.
As part of the TfS on-boarding process, IMCD formalised 
its sustainable procurement programme for the future, 
updated the governance structure and organisational 
responsibilities and enhanced processes on global and 
local level. In June 2023, the IMCD corporate sustainability 
team presented the programme to the TfS management. 
For further information, see Note 4.3 in the Notes to the 
Sustainability statements.
Our sustainability procurement practises include a 
screening programme, for which we, amongst other, 
partner with EcoVadis. In 2023, we again achieved to 
increase the scope of the screening applied, and included 
more upstream principals / suppliers and downstream 
third party logistic service providers.
In 2023 we achieved the following screening scores:
• 95% (based on logistic spend) of the 3PLs signed or 
verified  by alternative means the IMCD ESG Standards 
for Business Partners, our supplier code of conduct.
• 88% (based on logistic spend) of the 3PLs are Ecovadis 
rated or in the process of an Ecovadis assessment by 
the end of 2023.
• 91% (based on revenue) of upstream suppliers are 
Ecovadis rated or in the process of an Ecovadis 
assessment by the end of 2023.
We have set the following targets and KPIs.

6.3 Digitalisation
Over the past years IMCD created an unique global IT 
platform built upon an uniform ERP and CRM system 
which is used across the group. Our distinctive global 
systems serves as the foundation for the development 
of various digital functionalities and tools. This uniform 
IT platform sets IMCD apart in our industry, providing us 
with a competitive advantage over others.
Digitalisation is a fundamental element of our business 
model and omni-channel marketing and sales approach. 
Through our digital platforms we are able to connect 
and collaborate with our business partners and to deliver 
effective  and efficient  customer services and formulatory 
support. Our globally unified  system distinguishes 
IMCD within the ingredients and speciality chemicals 
distribution sector.
In 2023, digital innovation progressed across all pillars 
of the digital transformation programme including 
two new initiatives: Customer Care 360 and Sales & 
Buyer Enablement.
We rolled out Customer Care 360 in selected territories 
across regions to offer  a single environment where 
customer service members and inside sales staff  can 
execute their tasks and obtain the necessary information. 
This cockpit will be further enriched with new features 
in 2024.
Another strategic initiative in 2023 is the Sales & Buyer 
Enablement tool. This is a multi-application/ cloud project 
to assist the seller as well as the buyer to find  the right 
products and solutions. The sales enablement app is 
embedded in our current customer relation management 
(CRM) tool, whereas the buyer variant, to be delivered in 
2024, resides in the MyIMCD customer portal.
The MyIMCD portal adoption significantly  increased in 
2023 as a result of investment in feature extension, 
through involving dedicated talent at Group to drive the 
growth, and by a more refined  and improved play book 
for existing and new territories. Activation, on-boarding 
and engagement protocols were implemented based on 
earlier learnings. 2024 will be the year where portal 
and the country websites will be unified  to offer  an 
optimised buying journey for new leads as well as for 
existing customers.
Digital marketing has been realigned to the ambitions 
and size of the group. Firstly, marketing automation, 
the activity to generate leads through any channel using 
the automation capabilities of our CRM platform, was 
expanded with dedicated environments for each business 
group. This is needed to maintain proper governance, 
and it supports the organisation with a growing number 
of campaigns. Secondly, we started the integration of 
the digital marketing and digital commerce functions into 
one team, which will be completed in 2024. Marketing 
and sales are inseparable activities, starting from lead 
generation and ending with won sales.

relationships. 
As our digital platform is being rapidly adopted, it serves 
to complement traditional engagement channels. 
“The increasing number of customers using MyIMCD to 
interact with our account managers and to access 
technical documents indicates the growing 
importance of the platform and its role in 
supporting our ongoing business relationships 
around the world. At the end of 2023, the portal 
supported more than 19,000 users across more than 35 
countries, representing a three-digit increase in user 
growth compared to previous years,” said Vincent van der 
Leer, Platform and Digital Transformation Lead at IMCD.  
“Several new features are being rolled out this year that 
will further streamline the customer flow and strengthen 
our competitive position within the distribution space,” he 
concluded.

Integrity is essential to the way IMCD 
does business. IMCD has strong values 
and clear policies and standards in 
place to ensure that its employees 
always act in an ethical manner. By 
asking our partners to do the same, we 
aim to have a positive influence across 
our value chain.
Being a global company, subject to both international 
as well as many different  local laws, strong ethics 
and governance are of particular importance to 
IMCD. Breaches of laws, regulation, and even internal 
procedures or voluntary codes can have a major impact 
on IMCD's reputation as well as its financial  results.
With transparency on the aspects of our ethics and 
compliance framework and performance, IMCD aims to 
build trust with our employees, our external business 
partners and other stakeholders to engage in long-term 
professional relationships with IMCD. By maintaining 
an up-to-date compliance programme, with group-wide 
training efforts,  strict controls and risk management, and 
regular auditing, IMCD's efforts  are directed on continuing 
a high level of ethical business conduct and compliance in 
the future.
7 .1 Our social license to operate
Having a strong reputation in business ethics is part 
of IMCD's social licence to operate. We require our 
employees to adhere to all applicable international and 
local laws and regulations and take a zero-tolerance 
approach to unethical business conduct.
Compliance management & organisation
Ethical business conduct is a responsibility shared 
by all IMCD employees. In our company culture, we 
promote trust, confidence  and respect. By giving people 
the freedom to act and empowering them to drive 
business forward, IMCD has established a dynamic 
and entrepreneurial culture that embeds integrity, 
transparency, and compliance as core business values.
With a group wide compliance organisation, we aim 
to reinforce this culture so that our people can work 
in stimulating working environments with safe and 
respectful working conditions. We aim to ensure at all 
times an atmosphere where people feel confident  to make 
decisions, raise concerns and seek advice when in doubt.
Our approach to compliance management and the 
set-up of our compliance organisation is described in 
more detail in note 5.1 Ethics and Compliance to the 
Sustainability Statements.

Integrated Report 2023
Compliance framework
The IMCD Business Principles and Code of Conduct form 
the basis for IMCD's group compliance framework. These 
documents hold the summarise IMCD's group policies and 
business principles that guide our employees in ethical 
decision-making when representing IMCD in dealings with 
business partners and other stakeholders.
In the compliance framework, four core elements 
are identified:  fraud, corruption, antitrust, and trade 
compliance In these areas, more detailed policies, 
processes and guidance is provided to employees. More 
information on each topic can be found in note 5.1 Ethics 
and Compliance to the Sustainability Statements.
In 2023, IMCD reassessed the key performance indicators 
for the effectiveness  of its compliance programme and 
identified  new targets. Our achievements in 2023 and 
targets for 2024 and beyond are described below.
1. Communication and training are key
To achieve these goals, in a fast paces environment 
with strong growth, communication and training are 
important tools, for both new employees as for our 
existing employee base.
As of 2020, we have invested in a digital e-learning 
platform, to increase our training reach and have better 
visibility of the progress. After completing the roll out in 
all countries in 2023, we have now made regular refresher 
training (all employees should train and refresh once per 
two years) part of our programme.
By end of 2024, we aim to achieve that 100% of our 
employees is trained in our (digital) Ethics and Compliance 
Group Training curriculum.
COMMUNICATION AND TRAINING ON ANTI-
CORRUPTION POLICIES 2023 2022
Number of employees that IMCD's anti-
corruption policies and procedures have been 
communicated to.1

1 The IMCD Code of Conduct and Business Principles are communicated to 
every employee during their on boarding process, and the latest version 
is accessible always in a dedicated Compliance section on IMCD’s intranet.
2 For third parties, these policies are included in the ESG Standards for 
IMCD Business Partners, which are accessible to all on IMCD's website.
3 This includes anti-corruption training in our e-learning platform, included 
in, but also outside of the scope of the Ethics and Compliance Group 
Training curriculum, or training provided otherwise, for example via 
(classroom) training on local level.
More information on our compliance training efforts  
and the relevant topics addressed therein can be 
found in note 5.1 Ethics and Compliance to the 
Sustainability Statements.
2. Monitoring through internal risk reviews
A second important pillar that helps us to monitor 
the effectiveness  of the group compliance programme, 
is the work done by our Group Control and Internal 
Audit departments.
For each region, IMCD has a dedicated business controller 
who guides the countries in the implementation of 
measures and controls. In addition, all of IMCD's legal 
entities are periodically reviewed by the Internal Audit 
team. Part of these reviews is determining compliance 
with IMCD's policies and guidelines, including the anti-
corruption, bribery and fraud guidance.
In 2023, the number of entities visited increased and the 
percentage of operations (based on revenue) assessed 
amounted to 90% (2022: 88%). This is well above the aim 
to cover at lease 80% of operations, measured by revenue, 
in internal audit risk assessments, annually.
CORRUPTION RELATED RISK ASSESSMENTS 2023 2022
Entities reviewed by internal audit team 110 70
% of revenue covered by internal audit 
risk assessment
90% 88%
Based on the reviews conducted, along with the policies 
and guidelines communicated, and ongoing training 
efforts,  the probability of corruption-related risks in 2023 
remained estimated to be low.
3. Learn from incidents of non-compliance
A third element to increase the effectiveness  of our 
compliance programme is to investigate and learn from 
situations encountered throughout the year(s),where our 
high standards were (potentially) not upheld.
We encourage our employees to report any potential 
misconduct that they may encounter. This can be 
done directly to their managers or, if so desired 
anonymously and directly to head office,  through the 
IMCD Ethics and Compliance Hotline (see below for 
more information). All reports are investigated and, when 
confirmed,  appropriate measures are taken to remedy 
and prevent repetition.
With a zero tolerance-approach, IMCD strives for zero 
substantiated compliance incidents in any year.
In the year 2023, seven reports were received through 
the Ethics and Compliance Hotline (which is further 
discussed hereafter).

Integrated Report 2023
The reports in 2023 mainly concerned cases of suspected 
violation of the IMCD Code of Conduct and/or Business 
Principles. Of the seven reports, two were tests by 
employees or local staff  to get more insight on the 
reporting hotline and process followed. The other five  
incidents were investigated.
In one case, the report coincided with a local investigation 
in which appropriate measures were already taken. The 
case was referred and closed. Three report were not 
substantiated, either through investigation or lack of 
possibility to investigate (for example due to anonymous 
reporting and/or non-responsive reporters leading to a 
lack of specific  / factual information to investigate).
One case was assessed to be substantiated. An employee 
reported an offer  by a third party downstream vendor that 
could potentially qualify as a bribe to influence  a decision 
to assign more business to such vendor. In the selection 
process that was performed at the same time of the offer,  
the respective vendor was denied further business.
Together with our own internal findings,  this leads to the 
following overview of incidents for 2023.
CORRUPTION, BRIBERY OR FRAUD INCIDENTS1 2023 2022
Confirmed  compliance incidents concerning 
corruption, bribery or (employee) fraud
2 3
Incidents in which employees were dismissed 
or disciplined
1 3
Incidents whereby business partner contracts 
were terminated or not renewed due to 
corruption violations
1 0
Public legal cases regarding corruption brought 
against the organisation or its employees
0 0
1 The definitions  of corruption, bribery and fraud for inclusion in 
this overview are provided to IMCD's employees and reporting 
teams, in IMCD's group policies and reporting instructions. See 
for more information note 5.1 Ethics and Compliance to the 
Sustainability Statements.
Next to the case of attempted bribery described above, 
we discovered one additional fraud incident in an internal 
review. This has led to resignations of an employee whilst 
the internal investigation was still pending, and thereafter 
termination of a second employee. None of the incidents 
reported for 2023 led to significant  costs or damages 
for IMCD.
In all cases, internal controls and procedures were 
reviewed and updated to prevent similar incidents in the 
future. The cases are used in 'lessons learned' sessions 
with management and employees to create awareness for 
the situations that they can encounter.
Internal alerts and whistleblower system
Our employees have a channel to seek advice and 
report their concerns about unethical and unlawful 
behaviour through IMCD's Internal Alert Procedure. This 
procedure enables IMCD employees worldwide to report 
any irregularities or deviations in IMCD's operations from 
the IMCD Business Principles as described in our Code 
of Conduct.
In addition, IMCD maintains a global hotline to further 
support its Internal Alert Procedure. The IMCD Ethics and 
Compliance Hotline, offers  a web portal in 15 languages 
as well as locally-staffed  telephone hotlines in multiple 
countries. The hotline is available 24/7 to report any 
ethics concerns or breaches (or potential breaches) of 
IMCD's Code of Conduct, Business Principles or other 
group policies confidentially  and, if desired, anonymously. 
The hotline is also included in the ESG Standards for 
IMCD Business Partners and open to reports by third-
party stakeholders.

7 .2 Cybersecurity
Connectivity and digitisation play a crucial role in our 
services, now and in the future. With an extensive product 
portfolio of more than 48,000 products, and servicing 
around 64,000 customers and over 3,000 suppliers in 
2023, IMCD's business relies on the availability of large 
amounts of data. Responsible handling and protection 
of that data and our IT systems against cybersecurity 
failures, is a top priority for IMCD.
Information security management
A safe and secure IT environment is an essential resource 
for the global IMCD organisation to achieve its business 
goals. The Information Security Officer,  reporting to the 
CFO, oversees the application and effectiveness  of IMCD's 
Information Security Policy, which provides all group 
entities with clear guidance on how to gather, store, share 
and protect data.
Multiple layers of technical and organisational measures 
have been implemented, designed to protect against 
cyber attacks and ensure business continuity. More 
information can be found in note 5.2 Cybersecurityto the 
Sustainability Statements.
In 2023, regular penetration tests were executed again, 
both on the level of the group holding company, as well as 
14 operating entities where IT infrastructure is present. In 
addition, phishing tests were again held on a regular basis 
for the full group, up to a total of 4 in 2023.
There has been a continuous focus on cyber security. 
A new tool to manage identity access has been 
implemented to support the joiners, movers leavers 
process of employees and external accounts, and device 
management has been improved globally. We also further 
integrated sanction and adverse media monitoring in 
our software and processes. We invested again in 
penetration tests and we will continue to work on cyber 
security awareness, by means of mandatory trainings and 
awareness creation sessions, as well as phishing tests.
Data protection
At IMCD, we acknowledge the fundamental rights 
and freedoms of its employees, suppliers, customers 
and other third parties, including the rights that 
concern protection of privacy and personal information. 
Respecting local privacy laws and regulations, IMCD will 
ask permission to use any personal information if so 
required. We offer  transparency on the data we process, 
through our Privacy Statement published on our website.
In 2023, we experienced two security incidents, both 
consisting of a hacked email account, involving customer 
data / contact details. For one incident, the relevant data 
privacy authority was notified.  The financial  impact of the 
incidents experienced was not significant. 
SECURITY INCIDENTS 2023 2022
Security incidents involving customer data / 
contact details
2 0
Data breached reported to relevant authorities 1 0
In addition to the above mentioned two security incidents 
(hacked mailboxes), IMCD in 2023 experienced one case 
where (historical) customer data from an acquisition 
target was potentially misused by an employee after 
resignation. During employment the employee had 
authorised access to the data, but thereafter refused to 
return such data and/or confirm  full deletion. As the data 
is part of contractual confidentiality  arrangements, legal 
proceedings have been initiated to enforce the contractual 
agreement and criminal charges were filed. 
Other than these incidents, IMCD did not receive 
substantiated complaints concerning breaches of 
customer privacy or loss of customer data, nor did IMCD 
identify any other leak, theft or loss of customer data 
during internal screening.
Security awareness
IMCD's employees follow a mandatory training 
programme available in IMCD's e-learning tool. This 
training is followed by a test to ensure awareness and 
understanding of phishing and security breaches. The 
performance of IMCD's employees in the cyber security 
training programme is deemed a key indicator for the 
penetration of the awareness efforts. 
As of 2024, we strive to have 100% of employees trained in 
cyber security annually.

Employees that have succesfully completed cyber 
security training

Our approach to cybersecurity is described in more detail 
in note 5.2 Cybersecurityto the Sustainability Statements.
7 .3 Taxation
We pursue a principled and transparent tax strategy that 
is aligned with organisational values and aims to support 
the overall business strategy and objectives. We see tax as 
part of our corporate social responsibility. Our presence 
in each country is based on genuine commercial activities 
and IMCD pays its fair share in taxes over these activities.
Our group tax strategy is based on the key values 
and principles as described in our Code of Conduct 
which provides a framework for a business culture that 
stimulates integrity, honesty, transparency, and values 
sustainability, compliance, expertise and cultural diversity. 
These values promote a climate of trust and respectful 
relationships with IMCD’s business partners, investors and

tax authorities. The principles of IMCD’s Code of Conduct 
are further embodied in IMCD’s management instructions. 
Any irregularities in IMCD’s operations or deviations from 
IMCD’s business principles can be reported by IMCD 
employees using IMCD’s Internal Alert Procedure or Ethics 
and Compliance Hotline.
In 2023, IMCD had no agreements in place with tax 
authorities that secured an outcome that could not have 
been obtained based on a common understanding of 
applicable law and jurisprudence.
We complied with the principles and best practices of the 
Dutch Corporate Governance Code and the tax elements 
included therein throughout the year. Furthermore, IMCD 
adheres to the meaning and core values of the Tax 
Governance Code of the VNO-NCW.
IMCD's total tax expenses in 2023 was EUR 110.9 million. 
Its global effective  tax rate accumulated to 27.5% (2022: 
28.2%). In 2023, IMCD made cash corporate income tax 
payments to an amount of EUR 124.0 million.
In 2023, IMCD uses several Free Trade Zones for 
operational/supply chain purposes. We use Free Trade 
Zones to avoid double import duties in case of export to 
a country in the region or to supply a customs bonded 
warehouse of our customers. IMCD benefits  from Free 
Trade Zones in China, Dubai, Uruguay and Costa Rica. The 
size of the operations in Free Trade Zones are limited 
and do not have a material impact on the group. Any 
CIT benefit  is circumstantial and not the intent of the 
establishment in the Free Trade Zone.
In 2024, the Pillar 2 regulation will become applicable 
to the IMCD group. It is expected that for only one 
jurisdiction the IMCD group will be exposed to top-up tax 
in the foreseeable future. The amount of top-up tax is 
however not expected to have a material tax impact on 
the group.
Our tax strategy and policy provision are described in 
more detail in note 5.3 to the Sustainability Statements.

8.3 Shareholder engagement
IMCD values maintaining an active dialogue with its 
financial  stakeholders, like its current and potential 
shareholders, brokers and the financial  and other media. 
IMCD considers it very important to explain the IMCD 
business model and implementation so that stakeholders 
have the information they need to form an opinion on 
the company. IMCD releases financial  results and/or 
a intermediate trading update four times a year. Upon 
each release, the CEO and CFO host a conference call for 
research analysts and institutional investors to discuss 
these results. Audio and webcast replays of these analyst 
calls can be accessed and replayed from IMCD's website 
(Investors section).
The Management Board members from time to time 
receive feedback from institutional shareholders and 
investors as well as equity analysts, giving them a clear 
understanding of shareholders’ views and/or concerns. 
Analyst reports are also shared with IMCD's Supervisory 
Board to provide insight on financial  stakeholders' views. 
IMCD is currently covered by 16 international analysts.
In 2023, IMCD's investor relation activities included 
participation in various physical and virtual roadshows 
and investor conferences, in which management of 
IMCD engaged with investors from across all regions. 
Also a considerable number of meetings with (potential) 
investors took place by means of video conferencing and 
visits at IMCD headquarters.
8.4 Dividend policy
Barring exceptional circumstances,  under IMCD's 
dividend policy the intention is to pay an  annual dividend 
in the range of 25% to 35% of the adjusted net 
income (reported result for the year plus amortisation 
charges, net of tax) to be paid out either in cash or in 
shares. A proposal will be submitted to the Annual 
General Meeting of Shareholders to pay a cash dividend of 
EUR 2.24 per ordinary share (2022: EUR 2.37), an decrease 
of 5% compared with the previous year. This dividend 
represents a pay-out ratio of 35% of adjusted net income 
(2022: 35% of adjusted net income).

IMCD operates in different,  often fragmented market 
segments in multiple geographic regions, connecting 
many customers and suppliers across a very diverse 
product range. In general, results are impacted by 
macroeconomic conditions and developments in specific  
industries.
Results can be influenced  from period to period by, 
among other things, the ability to maintain and expand 
commercial relationships, the ability to introduce new 
products and start new customer and supplier 
relationships and the timing, scope and impact 
of acquisitions.
IMCD's consistent strategy and resilient business model 
has led to successful expansion over the years and IMCD 
remains focused on achieving earnings growth by 
optimising its services and further strengthening its 
market positions.
Despite the challenging geopolitical and macroeconomic 
conditions, including increased volatility in the customer 
demand, IMCD delivered solid results and healthy cash 
flow  in 2023. IMCD proofs to be a strong, resilient and well 
diversified  business with a robust liquidity position and 
capital structure.
IMCD sees interesting opportunities to further increase its 
global footprint and expand its product portfolio both 
organically and by acquisitions.
Other than in the ordinary course of the business, IMCD 
does not foresee significant  investments or changes to 
the organisation in 2024.

10 Supervisory Board report
The Supervisory Board supervises the 
policies pursued by the Management 
Board and its performance, and 
the general course of affairs within 
the company.
The Supervisory Board also advises 
the Management Board and supervises 
the dynamics and relationship between 
the Management Board and the other 
members of the Executive Committee.
This report provides information on 
the activities of the Supervisory Board 
during 2023.
10.1 Introduction by the Chair
After two years of exceptional strong growth, IMCD 
arrived at solid results in 2023, with substantial 
acquisition growth, operating EBITA of EUR 515 million 
and healthy cash-flow.  In addition, IMCD continued to 
pursue investments that will enable IMCD to benefit  from 
improving market conditions in the future.
With 13 acquisitions over the course of the year, and 
signing of another five  deals, further expansion into new 
business segments and/or geographies was achieved, in 
particular in the APAC and LATAM region. Furthermore, 
the continuing investments in its global IT and digital 
communication platforms will enable the company to 
accelerate its reach and optimise its services to customers 
and suppliers.
In addition to the execution of the growth strategy, 
the Supervisory Board attended to various recurring 
topics of supervision and advise, all described in more 
detail hereafter in this report. An area of attention for 
the Supervisory Board throughout the year was the 
integration of acquisitions into IMCD's compliance and 
governance structure, a topic that will also have the 
Supervisory Boards attention going forward.
However, the topic most at the forefront in 2023, 
from Supervisory Board perspective, has likely been the 
succession of IMCD’s long-time founder and CEO Piet van 
der Slikke. On behalf of the Supervisory Board, I want 
to use this introduction to thank Piet for his leadership 
during the first  three decades of IMCD, in which he has 
built a remarkably successful and resilient company. The 
board is confident  that the strong foundations laid, will 
enable IMCD to continue its success story.
The Supervisory Board conducted a thorough search 
process, which ultimately led to the nomination of one 
of its own members, Valerie Diele-Braun. As board, we 
are excited to have been able to nominate her, and glad 
to see the high support received by shareholders on 
this proposal.
The departure of Valerie Diele-Braun from the Supervisory 
Board brought with it an unforeseen vacancy in our own 
ranks. For this vacancy, we are happy that we could 
welcome in Dorthe Mikkelsen a seasoned international 
executive, with strong experience in the pharmaceutical 
domain to complete the Supervisory Board’s composition 
before heading into the new year.
We now look forward to continuing our work in this 
new, well-balanced composition and accompanying the 
management in its new composition in the next phase of 
driving business forward and delivering sustainable long-
term value for all stakeholders involved.

Integrated Report 2023
10.2 Composition, diversity and 
independence
During 2023, the Supervisory Board consisted of five  
members. The details of the five  members by year end 
2023, are provided in this Integrated Report on page 103. 
The tables on the right and on the next page provide an 
overview of the composition, attributes and skills of 
the Supervisory Board members.
Changes in 2023
In a press release published on 15 March 2023, 
the Supervisory Board announced its decision to 
nominate Valerie Diele-Braun as successor of Piet van der 
Slikke on the Management Board. This led to 
the departure of Valerie Diele-Braun from the Supervisory 
Board as of 1 October 2023.
By press release of 13 October 2023, the nomination 
of Dorthe Mikkelsen was announced to fill  the vacancy 
arisen due to the departure of Valerie Diele-Braun. Dorthe 
Mikkelsen was appointed by the EGM held on 
27 November 2023, with effect  as of such date.
Changes foreseen in 2024
The current retirement rota for the Supervisory Board 
shows that the terms of Janus Smalbraak and Amy Hebert 
expire in 2024. Both have indicated they are open for 
prolongation, and the Supervisory Board has announced 
their nomination by press release of 1 March 2024, for 
the 2024 AGM to vote upon.
Diversity on the Supervisory Board
The approach to, and targets for diversity of 
the Supervisory Board are discussed hereafter in 
paragraph 15.2. The Supervisory Board strives to have 
a diverse composition to ensure that the knowledge, skills 
and experience present are complementary, enabling 
each member to make a valuable contribution to 
the duties of the board or committee.
In addition, the Supervisory Board strives for diversity 
in the scheduled retirements of its members. When 
considering vacancies, achieving and/or maintaining an 
appropriate balance in gender, age and geographic 
background are important aspects that will be taken 
into account.
In 2023, the Supervisory Board profile  and diversity 
policy were taken into account in the search that led to 
the nomination of Dorthe Mikkelsen. With Dorthe, the 
board was strengthened with an experienced business 
leader and seasoned international executive in the 
pharmaceutical and healthcare industry. In addition to 
industry knowledge and international experience, she 
brings experience as non-executive board member, 
including in remuneration and audit committee roles. The 
Supervisory Board believes the experience and skills of 
Dorthe Mikkelsen complement the knowledge present in 
its composition.
Independence/Conflicts of interest
Throughout 2023, all Supervisory Board members 
qualified  as independent within the meaning of 
best-practice provision 2.1.8 of the Dutch Corporate 
Governance Code (the "Code"). IMCD has not granted 
any loans, advances, guarantees, shares or options to its 
Supervisory Board members. Their remuneration is not 
dependent on the company's results.
At the end of 2023, one Supervisory Board member, Janus 
Smalbraak, owned shares in IMCD. In line with the Code, 
these shares are held as a long-term investment.
In carrying out their duties all Supervisory Board 
members are fully aware of, and abide by, the conflict-

No Supervisory Board members entered into transactions 
in 2023 where there was an actual or potential conflict  of 
interest. In accordance with clause 2:140 DCC, and 10.3 
and 10.6 Supervisory Board Rules, Valerie Diele-Braun 
stepped down and abstained from the Supervisory Board 
committees she was a member of, and did not take 
part in any Supervisory Board deliberations concerning 
or connected to the succession process, whilst she was a 
candidate in the selection process.

10.3 Supervision in 2023
In performing their duties, the members of the 
Supervisory Board are guided by the interests of IMCD 
and all its stakeholders. The activities the Supervisory 
Board engaged in as well as the material matters on which 
its supervision was focused in 2023 are described in the 
following sections.
Meetings and attendance
Due to the topic of succession planning, the Supervisory 
Board met more often, both in person and virtually. 
Also, some members attended committee meetings as 
observer, leading to a closer cooperation and knowledge 
sharing throughout 2023. The combination of physical and 
virtual meetings has worked well and will be continued.
The Supervisory Board met face-to-face in its full 
composition in February, April, November and December. 
Other regular meetings were held with some of the 
members attending in person in Rotterdam and other 
members attending via videoconferencing. In addition to 
the regular scheduled meetings, the Supervisory Board 
held two fully virtual update calls, in January and October.
In total, nine meetings (including the two update calls) 
took place with the full Supervisory Board present. 
Six meetings were held with the Management Board 
members also present. Four Supervisory Board meetings 
consisted of or included a closed session without the 
Management Board members attending.
Between meetings, the members of the Supervisory Board 
were in regular contact with each other, by telephone and 
e-mail. To prepare for meetings and to discuss the current 
state of affairs,  the Chair regularly spoke with the CEO 
and other members of the Management Board. The full 
Executive Committee was present during the Supervisory 
Board meeting in December 2023. The two candidates 
for appointment to the Executive Committee joined that 
meeting as observer. In this two-day session with a 
farewell lunch and dinner event for Piet van der Slikke, 
the Supervisory Board had many opportunities to interact 
in an informal way with IMCD's senior management and 
gained good insight in the dynamics and the relationship 
between the Management Board and the Executive 
Committee members.
The following table shows the attendance record of the 
individual Supervisory Board members. Attendance is 
expressed as the number of meetings attended out of the 
number the member was eligible to attend.

1 Dorthe Mikkelsen attended all SB meetings held in 2023 as of her 
appointment. In addition, she was observer in 1 RC meeting, as were 
Willem Eelman and Amy Hebert.
2 Valerie Diele-Braun stepped down from the RC and NAC in January 2023 
and hence, did not attend (nor invoiced any fees for committee work 
during 2023). She took part in five  SB meetings, up to her appointment 
to the MB, after which she took part as MB member in November and 
December 2023.
Supervisory Board working visit
In addition to above meetings, the Supervisory Board 
travelled to Dubai for a work visit covering the Middle-
East and APAC regions. Next to senior management 
from various countries, the full Management Board 
and Executive Committee joined, offering  opportunity to 
engage on business topics, and during the informal parts 
of the programme. In the work sessions during the visit, 
the Supervisory Board discussed the strategy, risks and 
opportunities for IMCD in the Middle East and APAC 
regions, including growth paths per country, business 
group strategies, and developments in the regional head 
office  and support functions (such as Health & Safety, 
Regulatory and Quality).
10.4 Topics of discussion and advice
Regular items on the Supervisory Board agenda in 
2023 remained the development of results, the financial  
position of the group, acquisition projects and evaluations, 
and reports on any matters relating to material risks, 
claims and compliance issues.
To provide more insight, some matters of material 
significance  relating to the supervision in 2023 by the 
Supervisory Board are discussed in more detail in the 
following sections.
Management Board composition and 
succession planning
Management succession was an important topic during 
2023, on which the Supervisory Board spent substantial 
time. Early in 2023, with the help of an external firm,  a 
thorough succession process was conducted. Under the 
lead of the Chair, the NAC prepared the various steps, 
interviews and assessments, after which the SB evaluated 
and decided on the nomination for the CEO position.
The Supervisory Board is excited that it had the 
opportunity to nominate Valerie Diele-Braun for this role, 
and glad about the positive shareholder response to 
her appointment (99.94% approval). With Valerie, IMCD 
welcomes an all-round CEO in the chemical industry, 
well-equipped to ensure the continuation of strong 
management across the group, together with IMCD's CFO 
and COO.

Integrated Report 2023
The succession process also led to more frequent contacts 
during the year between (members of) the Supervisory 
Board, Management Board, Executive Committee and 
senior managers. This provides the Supervisory Board 
with helpful insight in the dynamics in the senior 
management layer. One of the conclusions drawn in the 
Supervisory Board's self-evaluation at the end of year, 
was that the increased access to the second management 
layer in IMCD is of added value in the execution of its 
duties and it strives to continue this practice in 2024.
Strategy
On various occasions, the Management Board and the 
Supervisory Board discussed the company's strategy 
for long-term value creation and its implementation. In 
2023, time was again spent on regional aspects and 
developments, in particular on the Middle-East and APAC 
region. Often, the discussion was closely connected to 
potential acquisitions or other business opportunities as 
presented by the Management Board. The Management 
Board made good progress in the execution of IMCD's 
growth strategy in all regions.
In the December meeting, the Management Board 
reported on the general strategy and associated risks, 
with the full Executive Committee present, providing 
the Supervisory Board with thorough insight into the 
ambitions of the company and the state of play. It was 
agreed to organise a new strategy session in the first  half 
of 2024, to discuss with, and involve in an early phase, 
the Supervisory Board the strategy update by the new 
management team. This session will focus as well on the 
sustainability elements of the strategy, opportunities for 
M&A, and digital transformation.
Acquisitions
In addition to pursuit of organic growth, acquisitions offer  
IMCD the strategic benefit  of building economies of scale, 
strengthening its presence in certain business segments 
and/or eliminating product portfolio gaps.
2023 was an active year for IMCD on the M&A market. 
The company completed the acquisition of thirteen 
businesses, and in addition, signed five  share or asset 
purchase agreements which were or will be closed in 
2024. The Supervisory Board was updated on the M&A 
projects and pipeline during all of its regular meetings 
with the Management Board and gave due consideration 
and approval to the opportunities presented. During the 
scheduled strategy meeting in 2024, additional attention 
will be given to the company's M&A strategy.
The acquisitions approved in 2023 were spread across 
regions, with a focus on growth markets across 
Latin America and Asia. More information on each 
of the acquisitions itself is available in Paragraph 3.1 
(Developments 2023) in this Integrated Report.
With the newly added business, the Supervisory Board is 
confident  that IMCD is well-positioned to, under improving 
economic conditions, accelerate future business growth, 
which creates sustainable and long-term value for 
IMCD's stakeholders.
Of course, not all acquisition opportunities actually come 
to fruition. As in prior years, the Supervisory Board 
and Management Board regularly discuss projects and 
opportunities in which, for example, the strategic fit  was 
ultimately deemed insufficient,  or conflicts  were believed 
to be too material to close the deal.
Operational performance and budget planning
During all meetings, those present discussed in detail 
the company's recent operational performance and the 
development of the results, of the company as a whole 
and by region, as well as by country if there were 
grounds to do so. During such updates, the Management 
Board informs the Supervisory Board about material 
developments in the markets, or any changes in economic 
circumstances relevant to IMCD.
Furthermore, important organisational changes per 
region and important developments concerning IMCD’s 
relationship with its major suppliers and/or customers are 
reported and the opportunities or risks to be expected 
from such developments are discussed.
During the Supervisory Board’s meeting in December 
2023, the budget for 2024 was presented and approved. 
The budget is the outcome of an extensive internal 
process of local and regional budget discussions.
The budget presentation was discussed with the full 
Executive Committee present, providing an opportunity 
for the Supervisory Board members to discuss market 
conditions, competitors, opportunities and risks as well 
as other developments within specific  regions and IMCD’s 
Business Groups in greater depth.
Global developments
Geopolitical and macroeconomic developments remained 
turbulent at times, causing various commercial challenges 
as well, including increased costs and product prices, as 
well as weaker demand in certain business segments. In 
its meetings, the Supervisory Board regularly discussed 
the challenges IMCD encountered or anticipated as a 
consequence of such developments, the impact on the 
organisation, IMCD's people, and the financial  results.
Sustainability
2023 was a year of executing on the plans and initiatives 
sowed in 2022. Progress was made on many terrains, 
albeit more internally than externally visible this year.
In line with the bonus targets set for the Management 
Board, the company increased its environmental, social

and governance (ESG) screening of suppliers, upstream 
and downstream. Over 90% of suppliers is now reviewed 
for an EcoVadis rating and collaboration has started with 
business partners on improvements (where relevant).
IMCD also worked to implement a revised emission 
calculation methodology, aligning itself with the guidance 
by Together for Sustainability (TfS), the chemical industry's 
leading round-table initiative that IMCD joined last year. As 
this was also part of the bonus criteria, more information 
can be found in the Remuneration Report included in this 
Integrated Report.
The company furthermore reassessed its alignment with 
the UN SDGs and aligned its Sustainable Solutions 
programme with the updated categorisation. The 
Supervisory Board was informed about the development 
of IMCD's digital sales and buyer enablement tool, which 
will feature the sustainability accelerators identified  by the 
Sustainable Solutions Taskforce up to date. This tool will 
launch in 2024. As demonstrated in other chapters of this 
Integrated Report, the company also made good progress 
in identifying metrics, performance indicators and targets 
for other ESG topics.
The external ratings and recognitions received again 
showed improvement and indicate that IMCD remains 
at the forefront of the industry and leading in ESG 
practices. In 2024, the Supervisory Board will discuss 
the sustainability aspects of IMCD's long-term strategy 
in more depth with the Management Board in its 
new composition.
Employee engagement & diversity
As IMCD keeps growing, talent development, diversity and 
inclusion in the company remain important topics for 
the Supervisory Board. The execution of the HR strategy 
was discussed in detail in the presence of the Global HR 
Director. Focus in 2023 was on the further development 
of a D&I policy, set ambitious diversity targets and 
action plans.
Gender diversity has increased further, also in the sub-
top of senior managers, reaching 44% female leaders 
and 31% women with commercial positions with P&L 
responsibility. With this, IMCD is on its way to establish 
a robust and diverse talent pipeline for future leaders. To 
support this positive development for the longer term, 
a diversity target is again included in the 2024 bonus 
criteria, focussing on appointment of female leaders in 
senior management positions with P&L responsibility.
In 2022, IMCD conducted a worldwide employee 
engagement study for the first  time. This study will now 
be repeated in 2024.
IT infrastructure and controls
An annually recurring topic of great importance is the 
operation and management of IMCD’s IT infrastructure. 
IMCD’s operations are supported by sophisticated and 
modern IT solutions, which play an important role in the 
further digitalisation of the business model.
An annual review and strategy update took place with the 
Audit Committee in June 2023, this year with both the 
Group IT Director and Group Information Security Officer  
present. It was established that good progress has been 
made on all strategic objectives of IMCD’s IT strategy.
Digital developments and impact and opportunities for 
IMCD's business model were discussed as well. In its self-
evaluation, the Supervisory Board has concluded to plan 
further deep dive sessions on the topic, open to more 
board members during 2024.
MB and SB performance assessment
In the absence of the Management Board members, the 
Supervisory Board assessed their individual performance 
and discussed the related remuneration. In addition, in 
closed sessions, the Supervisory Board discussed its own 
composition and diversity, the Supervisory Board profile,  
Supervisory Board Rules and its remuneration. A list of the 
other positions of the Supervisory Board members was 
discussed as well.
In two closed sessions in November, the Supervisory 
Board members conducted a self-assessment concerning 
the functioning of the Supervisory Board, its members and 
its committees, including topics such as the interaction 
between the Supervisory Board and the Management 
Board and information provision to the Supervisory 
Board. This year, the process included individual feedback 
meetings between the Chair and Supervisory Board 
members and two round-table discussions, including one 
in the Supervisory Board new composition.
Findings and conclusions
The most important findings  and conclusions were 
as follows:
• Overall, the Supervisory Board was positive on its 
functioning throughout the year.
• Factors that contributed to this conclusion were the 
close and constructive cooperation that took place 
during the CEO-succession process and the established 
open culture that throughout the year allowed for 
meaningful debate.
• Five members to be a balanced composition, allowing a 
proper task allocation.
• All members showed commitment through high 
attendance and flexibility  to meet outside of the 
regular meeting calendar.
• Evaluating its knowledge and expertise, the Supervisory 
Board would like to schedule deep-dive sessions on the 
topics of sustainability, and digital transformation.
• After good experience with the work visit in Dubai, the 
Supervisory Board aims to have more interaction with 
the sub-top of senior managers in the company.

Integrated Report 2023
• With Valerie Diele-Braun starting as CEO in January 
2024, the Supervisory Board sees opportunity to be 
closely involved in strategy setting, for which a separate 
meeting is planned.
Actions upon evaluation
The findings  and conclusions were shared with the 
Management Board. To follow-up on the defined  topics 
for focus in 2024, the Company Secretary is tasked with 
planning additional time for deep-dive meetings and 
interaction with IMCD's senior management throughout 
the year.
In line with the new Code, it was decided to have the 
evaluation take place with guidance of an external expert 
once every four years.
Knowledge and education
As part of the continuous Supervisory Board training 
programme, the Supervisory Board was informed of 
developments in relevant legislation, for example in the 
field  of gender diversity (reporting) in the Netherlands, 
the revision of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, 
and the broad spectrum of sustainability and reporting 
legislation, standards and requirements that is or will 
come into force and with which IMCD is preparing to 
comply. With the AC members, specific  legislation such 
as NIS2 (cybersecurity) and Pillar II (tax) were discussed 
in more detail. In respect of sustainability reporting, the 
Supervisory Board decided to hold a further deep-dive 
session for all members, to be organised in 2024.
The Supervisory Board members furthermore have access 
to market reports covering IMCD and/or its competitors, 
which they can use to inform themselves and develop 
more in-depth knowledge of relevant market conditions, 
opportunities and the challenges that IMCD faces.
10.5 Supervisory Board committees
During 2023, the Supervisory Board worked with three 
committees: an Audit Committee (AC), a Remuneration 
Committee (RC) and a Nomination and Appointment 
Committee (NAC). The division in tasks and responsibilities 
and the working methods of the Supervisory Board and its 
committees are described in more detail in the Corporate 
Governance chapter.
Audit Committee (AC)
The Audit Committee held four regular meetings in 
2023, all of which were attended by IMCD's CFO, the 
Director of Corporate Control, the Director Internal Audit 
and representatives of the external auditor, Deloitte 
Accountants B.V. (Deloitte). Minutes of the meetings were 
submitted to the Supervisory Board and the Chair of 
the Audit Committee provided regular updates of the 
discussions that took place. Additional meetings and calls 
took place in respect of the audit firm  rotation that was 
proposed and approved by the 2023 AGM.
The Audit Committee discussed IMCD’s accounting policies 
and valuation methods as used in the preparation of its 
quarterly, semi-annual and annual financial  reports for 
the full Supervisory Board. In addition, post-acquisition 
reviews of recent acquisitions, IMCD's IT infrastructure 
and strategy and internal control, governance and related 
risks, were on the agenda.
In January and February, the AC spent considerable 
time on the tender process for rotation of the external 
audit firm.  The process, selection criteria, evaluation 
and recommendation are described in more detail in 
Annex 3 to the convocation of the 2023 AGM, available 
on IMCD's website. The selection process resulted in a 
proposal to reappoint Deloitte for the audit in 2024, 
and thereafter rotate to EY for a first  three-year period 
covering book year 2025-2027. Both proposals were 
approved by shareholders with 100% votes cast in favour.
In its regular meeting in February, the Audit Committee 
furthermore discussed the 2022 annual report and 
financial  statements, and the 2022 audit in detail with the 
external auditor. Other topics discussed were the dividend 
proposal and IMCD's refinancing  activities.
In April, the internal auditor presented his findings  for 
the period up to and including March 2023, the annual 
post-acquisitions review, and external audit evaluation. 
The external audit plan for 2023 was discussed and the 
AC recommended approval to the Supervisory Board.
In June, the Audit Committee discussed the design and 
operation of IMCD's internal control and risk management 
system and the risk assessment cycle with the Director 
of Corporate Control. In addition, the Director Internal 
Audit discussed the internal audit reporting topics and 
the positive outcome of external quality assessment of 
the Internal Audit department. The Internal Audit Charter 
was discussed and approved. In this summer meeting, 
an annual deep-dive takes place on the topics of IT 
and cybersecurity.
IMCD's Group IT Director presented an update of 
the IT landscape and strategic developments. IMCD's 
Information Security Officer  presented the same for 
the topic of cybersecurity, with attention for internal 
communication and training, and security assessments 
and action plans for the integration of acquisitions.
The topic of sustainability reporting was added to the 
agenda and the roadmap for IMCD's first  integrated 
report, with assurance on non-financial  information was 
discussed with the External Auditor present. The actions 
initiated to comply with European sustainability reporting 
legislation as of 2024 (CSRD) were also reviewed.

Integrated Report 2023
After this meeting, the Audit Committee reported its 
findings  to the Supervisory Board and the board 
concluded that all required and desirable internal control 
elements were still effectively  subsumed within the 
agenda, programme and tasks of the internal auditor and 
the corporate (control) team.
In November, the internal audit plan for 2024 was 
presented to the Audit Committee and subsequently 
approved by the full Supervisory Board. The Audit 
Committee furthermore discussed the internal audit 
findings  up to and including September 2023 and the 
implementation of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. 
In the tax and treasury update, the Audit Committee 
discussed IMCD's tax strategy and tax developments 
impacting the company. Subsequently an update was 
provided by the Audit Committee to the Supervisory 
Board in its November meeting in line with the principles 
as set out in the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.
External auditor
The Supervisory Board is responsible for engaging and 
supervising the performance of the external auditor. 
Deloitte Accountants B.V. (Deloitte) was reappointed as 
IMCD’s external auditor for the financial  years 2022 and 
2023 at the 2022 AGM. The Audit Committee and the 
Management Board reported to the Supervisory Board on 
Deloitte’s envisaged audit plan for 2023, the relationship 
with and functioning of Deloitte as external auditor, as 
well as on other audit and non-audit services provided to 
IMCD by Deloitte.
Deloitte attended the meetings of the Supervisory Board 
in February and December 2023, in which discussions 
were held on the financial  statements and the key 
audit points, and observations and recommendations as 
presented in the auditor's management letter.
Deloitte confirmed  its independence from IMCD in 
accordance with the professional standards applicable to 
statutory auditors of public-interest entities.
Remuneration Committee (RC)
The Remuneration Committee convened three times 
in 2023 (in February, May and December), with 
IMCD's Global HR Director attending all meetings. The 
Remuneration Committee’s members throughout the year 
were Stephan Nanninga (Chair) and Janus Smalbraak. 
As of 13 January 2023, Valerie Diele-Braun stepped 
down, due to her participation as candidate in the 
CEO succession process. Upon appointment of Dorthe 
Mikkelsen, it was decided that she will succeed Janus 
Smalbraak as member of the Remuneration Committee as 
of 1 January 2024.
The members also held regular consultations to 
discuss, amongst other matters, the proposals for the 
compensation package for the new CEO and (amendment 
of) the remuneration of the individual members of the 
Management Board. The Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee provided regular updates to the Supervisory 
Board of the discussions that took place. Where deemed 
helpful and efficient,  other members of the Supervisory 
Board joined the RC meetings as observer.
The Remuneration Committee furthermore prepared the 
Supervisory Board’s Remuneration Report for 2023, which 
is included in this Integrated Report.
MB and SB remuneration
The remuneration policy for the Management Board 
was last amended in 2020 to bring it in line with 
the new legal requirements applicable as a result of 
the implementation of the Revised Shareholders' Rights 
Directive. The revisions were approved by the General 
Meeting on 30 June 2020, that at the time also adopted 
a formal written remuneration policy for the Supervisory 
Board at the time.
In addition to the regular committee meetings in 2023, a 
separate project was set up to evaluate the policies and 
prepare such for (re)approval during the 2024 AGM. In this 
process, the RC chair was closely involved and took part 
in multiple stakeholder engagement meetings, which took 
place with support of an external advisory firm. 
The 2023 Remuneration Report contains further details 
on how the remuneration policies were implemented in 
2023. Detailed information on the compensation of the 
Management Board and Supervisory Board in 2023 is set 
forth in note 53 to the financial  statements.
The format of the Remuneration Report follows the 
recommendations included in the Revised Shareholders' 
Rights Directive, of 2020. In 2023, the 2023 Remuneration 
report was submitted to the General Meeting for an 
advisory vote. It was again well received with 89.3% 
of the votes cast in favour of approval (2021: 91.01%). 
Nevertheless, the input received from stakeholders during 
the engagement meetings provided valuable insights and 
the Remuneration Committee has strived to improve 
disclosures to meet stakeholder requests.
Nomination and Appointment Committee (NAC)
In 2023, the Nomination and Appointment Committee 
was chaired by the Supervisory Board's Chair, Janus 
Smalbraak. As of 13 January 2023, Valerie Diele-Braun 
stepped down, due to her participation as candidate in 
the CEO succession process. The committee continued 
with Stephan Nanninga and Amy Hebert as the other two 
members in its composition.
The search process and candidate assessment for 
the CEO role was thoroughly planned and executed 
in close alignment with IMCD's Global HR Director.

Integrated Report 2023
The Supervisory Board was supported by an external 
recruitment and assessment firm  throughout the process.
In the second half of the year, the NAC focussed on its 
own composition and the search to replace Valerie Diele-
Braun.
In its meetings in February and October, the NAC 
evaluated the size and composition of the Management 
Board and Supervisory Board, prepared nominations for 
the succession of Piet van der Slikke and subsequent 
the vacancy on the Supervisory Board, discussed senior 
management appointments that took place in the group 
over the year. In both meetings, Willem Eelman joined 
as observer, allowing for efficient  process management 
and decision-making.
In between meetings, regular update calls and informal 
contact and consultations took place between the Chair 
of the NAC and other member of the Supervisory Board, 
IMCD management and IMCD's Global HR Director.
10.6 Financial statements 2023 and profit 
appropriation
The Supervisory Board reviewed and discussed the annual 
integrated report and the financial  statements for 2023 
with all parties involved in the preparations. Based on 
these discussions the Supervisory Board concludes that 
the annual integrated report provides a solid basis for 
the Supervisory Board’s accountability for its supervision 
in 2023.
The financial  statements for the financial  year 2023 were 
prepared by the Management Board and audited by 
Deloitte Accountants B.V. The financial  statements and the 
outcome of the audit performed by the external auditor 
were discussed by the Supervisory Board in the presence 
of the external auditor in February 2024.
The financial  statements 2023 were endorsed by all 
Management Board and Supervisory Board members and 
are included, together with Deloitte’s auditor’s report, 
under "Other information" on page 280 of this annual 
integrated report. The Management Board will present the 
2023 financial  statements and its report at the AGM.
The Supervisory Board recommends that the AGM 
adopt the 2023 financial  statements, including a 
proposed dividend of EUR 2.24 in cash per share. In 
addition, the Supervisory Board recommends that the 
members of the Management Board and Supervisory 
Board will be discharged from liability in respect of 
their respective management and supervisory activities 
performed in 2023.
Looking back, the Supervisory Board has had a productive 
year, in which it had more close contact with the 
company, its people and stakeholders, and interacted on 
a broad variety of topics. On multiple occasions, the board 
members experienced first  hand the unique and often 
fun culture in IMCD. The year closed with saying farewell 
to IMCD's founder and extraordinary CEO, Piet van der 
Slikke, who has led the company on an impressive growth 
story in its 29 years of history.
Now entering a new phase, the Supervisory Board is 
confident  that the strong foundations laid in the past offer  
many opportunities for IMCD to continue its long-term 
success story and is excited to accompany management in 
its new composition on this journey.

11 Remuneration report
The Remuneration Committee of the 
Supervisory Board is responsible 
for assessing and preparing the 
remuneration policy and remuneration 
proposals concerning the members 
of the Management Board and the 
Supervisory Board. The Supervisory 
Board assesses the proposals and, in 
the event of proposed policy changes, 
submits the remuneration policy to the 
General Meeting for adoption.
This remuneration report provides an 
overview of the remuneration policy 
for IMCD's Management Board and its 
implementation in 2023.
11.1 Introduction by the Chair
The Remuneration Committee has had an active year 
in 2023. Due to the announced retirement of IMCD's 
long-time CEO Piet van der Slikke, and subsequent the 
participation of Valerie Diele-Braun in the succession 
process, the committee early in the year reduced to two 
members. In this composition, it attended to various 
topics and planned projects.
First, the committee initiated a renewal of the benchmark 
recurring benchmark study, again executed by EY, to be 
well prepared and able to offer  an appropriate package 
for the CEO function. Thereafter, a broader review of the 
management board compensation took place.
In the second half of the year, the committee evaluated 
the remuneration policies and prepared a revision to be 
put to vote during the 2024 AGM. This process included 
a stakeholder dialogue process, in which the chair of 
the Remuneration Committee and IMCD's Global HR 
Director engaged with shareholders, proxy voting agency's 
and Eumedion to receive feedback on the remuneration 
policies and suggested changes.
This process brought valuable insights, but also 
the confirmation  that IMCD's remuneration policies, 
by and large, are perceived as straightforward, not 
overcomplicated and fair. The committee therefore hopes 
that the proposals will again be adopted with a high 
approval vote, as was the case in 2020.
Key highlights – 2023 performance
At the end of the year, the committee attended to the 
regular topics, which included the remuneration scenario 
analysis based on the forecasted results of the year. After 
two exceptional years of very strong growth, business in 
2023 remained resilient despite challenging conditions.
The financial  results in 2023 were solid, with substantial 
acquisition growth, operating EBITA of EUR 515 million 
and healthy cash-flow.  Operating EBITA margin remained 
nearly as high as in 2022 (11.6% vs 12.0%), which was the 
highest level in the past 10 years.
On the non-financial  targets set by the Supervisory Board, 
good progress was made as well. In respect of the 
methodology to calculate emissions, IMCD's team worked 
hard to progress, enabling the company to from now 
on carry out these calculations in-house for scope 1, 2 
and 3. This is of value for the long-term as well, as it 
allows for better insight and more visibility of emission 
developments and trends in management information.
Taking up its role to promote best-in-class ESG practices, 
from its position in the middle of supply chains, the 
committee was happy to see that IMCD's teams increased 
the coverage of the ESG screening programme to include 
over 90% of upstream and downstream suppliers.1
On diversity, the company delivered again on its targets 
to appoint over 40% women in leadership roles, as well as 
over one third women in roles with P&L responsibility. The 
committee sees the latter as particularly important, as it 
helps to build a strong and diverse internal talent pipeline, 
which is key for future internal promotions, contributing 
to the long-term success of the company.
Stephan Nanninga
Chair of the Remuneration Committee
1 In line with the 2023 targets for the MB remuneration, this was calculated based on the FY 2022 spend/revenue. Early in 2024, IMCD decided to start reporting the coverage based on the actual year's results, leading to 91% upstream and 88% 
downstream coverage in the screening programme.

11.3 Remuneration policies
The Remuneration Policy for the Management Board was 
last amended in 2020, to align it with new requirements 
in the Dutch Civil Code following the implementation of 
the Revised Shareholders’ Rights Directive. The policy was 
approved by the AGM with 94.85% of the votes cast 
in favour.
At the same time, a separate Remuneration Policy for the 
Supervisory Boardwas adopted (99.49% of votes cast in 
favour). In 2022, the AGM approved a revision of the fixed  
fees for the Supervisory Board members (99.58% of votes 
cast in favour). No further changes took place in 2023.
In line with Dutch law requirements, the remuneration 
policies for the Management Board and Supervisory Board 
will be resubmitted to the shareholders for approval 
during the 2024 AGM. A stakeholder engagement process 
was initiated by the Remuneration Committee in 2023, 
to gather insights in the input and expectations of 
shareholders for the update of the policies.
Objective and principles
The objective of the remuneration policies is to 
attract, motivate and retain highly qualified  executives 
by providing them with a balanced and competitive 
remuneration package that is focused on sustainable 
results and is aligned with IMCD’s long-term strategy. 
This remuneration philosophy does not apply only to 
executives in IMCD. For all its employees, IMCD wants to 
be an attractive employer, with competitive remuneration 
levels in the relevant labour markets, whilst maintaining 
flexibility  to reflect  differences  in size and complexity of 
individual responsibilities in the compensation offering. 
For the remuneration of the Supervisory Board the 
guiding principle is that the (amount and) level should 
reflect  the time spent by, and the responsibilities of 
the Supervisory Board members. Given the nature 
of responsibilities of the Supervisory Board, the 
remuneration is not dependent on the results of IMCD; 
it consists of a fixed  compensation only.
Although the company's strategy is primarily set by the 
Management Board, the remuneration policy is designed 
in such a way that the Supervisory Board can ensure, by 
defining  the performance criteria and (operational and 
financial)  targets under the remuneration policy, that the 
remuneration of the Management Board is linked to and 
supports the company's strategic priorities. It enables the 
Supervisory Board to encourage actions focused on long-
term value creation and a sustainable contribution to 
all stakeholders.
Market positioning / peer review
The remuneration of the members of the Management 
Board is set around the median of remuneration levels 
payable within a peer group of comparable Dutch stock 
exchange listed companies, relevant to IMCD from a 
labour market perspective.
The Supervisory Board takes into account the internal 
ratio to the positions below the Management Board 
as well. All components of the remuneration packages 
are reviewed annually. On the initiative of the 
Remuneration Committee this review may include an 
external benchmark evaluation. The peer group taken 
into account for a remuneration benchmark consists of 
AEX and AMX companies in the Netherlands with similar 
revenues and similar market capitalisation. Substantially 
smaller or larger companies, financial  institutions and 
real estate companies are excluded from the peer group, 
as well as companies with poor disclosure in respect of 
remuneration details.
To prepare an appropriate compensation package for the 
new CEO, the benchmark study performed by EY in 2021 
was updated at the beginning of 2023. The peer group 
was kept the same to the extent the companies still met 
the criteria described in this paragraph. The peer group 
comprised 15 companies, as listed in the following table.
REMUNERATION PEER GROUP COMPANIES 2023 INDEX
Koninklijke DSM AEX
JDE Peet's AEX
AkzoNobel AEX
Just Eat Takeaway.com AEX
Koninklijke KPN AEX
ASM International AEX
BE Semiconductor Industries AEX
Signify AEX
Konklijke Vopak AMX
Aalberts Industries AMX
OCI AMX
Corbion AMX
SBM Offshore AMX
Arcadis AMX
PostNL AMX
In comparison to 2021, Grandvision and Boskalis were 
removed due their delisting from the stock exchange. 
Koninklijke BAM Groep was excluded because it is 
now traded as a AScX (small-cap) fund. Taking market 
capitalisation and revenue criteria into account, JDE Peet's 
and BE Semiconductor Industries were added to the 
reference group.
11.4 Application of the policy in 2023
Hereafter the application of the policies for the different  
elements in the compensation packages is discussed.

Integrated Report 2023
Base salary
The base salary for the members of the Management 
Board is determined by the Supervisory Board. At the 
start of 2023, the base salaries of all board members were 
adjusted for inflation  on the basis of the Dutch Consumer 
Price Index (CPI) determined by Statistics Netherlands 
(Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek). For Piet van der Slikke 
and Hans Kooijmans a 6% correction was applied. The 
adjustment for Marcus Jordan was applied pro rata, for 
the period of his appointment from May 2022 till end of 
year, leading to a correction of 4.9%.

1 Valerie Diele-Braun was appointed to the Management board as per 
1 October 2023. The remuneration included herein is the pro rata 
remuneration for the period as of October up to and including 
December 2023.
The benchmark study performed at the start of 2023 led 
to a review of the packages of the CFO and COO as well. 
With effect  as of 1 October 2023, their base salaries were 
increased with 10%, aligning their packages with market 
practice and ensuring internal pay consistency within the 
Management Board in its new composition.
Short term incentive (STI)
The objective of the Management Board's short-term 
incentive plan, is to ensure that the members of 
the Management Board prioritise defined  short-term 
objectives often operational, that support sustainable 
value creation on the longer term .
STI structure and value
The short-term incentive consists of a (potential) cash 
bonus payment, depending on the level of achievements 
of pre-set targets. This applies equally to all members of 
the Management Board.
The short-term incentive structure is straight forward and 
set up as follows:
STI VARIABLE PAY STRUCTURE (% OF BASE SALARY)
Under performance (below set threshold) 0%
At target performance 50%
Maximum opportunity (capped) 75%
Each year, the Supervisory Board selects financial  and 
non-financial  targets for the Management Board's short-
term incentive plan and determines their weight.
STI performance criteria 2023
The following table shows the selected criteria, their 
weight and the performance ranges (minimum, at target 
and maximum pay-out levels) that applied to the 2023 
short-term bonus.

• no added 
EBITA
• target

- full award
10%
For the organic growth component, the budget as 
approved by the Supervisory Board is used to define  
the target for 'at target performance'. The threshold for 
underperformance, leading to no pay-out, is reached at 
10% below the target performance. In between these 
targets, performance is measured and awarded in the 
basis of a linear scale.
The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that in its annual 
discussion with the Management Board, the budget is 
set at a sufficiently  ambitious level, in support of IMCD's 
sustainable long-term growth strategy and long-term 
guidance to the market. Only strong performance, being 
a significant  5% accelerated organic growth in any year 
can deliver the maximum bonus pay-out. Hence, the 
Supervisory Board feels it is proportional to use a 10% cut 
off  for the lowest bonus threshold.
For commercial and strategic reasons, the actual 
operating EBITA target number is not disclosed ex 
ante. IMCD took note of the expressed desire of some 
stakeholders to provide more insight in the over or 
underachievement of targets ex post, which is addressed 
below in this report.
Non-financial STI criteria
For 2023, non-financial  criteria were set in respect of 
two topics; (i) social / diversity, and (ii) sustainability. Each 
category had a weight of 50%, hence each represented 
15% of the total bonus opportunity. The metrics and 
performance review by the Supervisory Board for the 
two topics selected for 2023 are explained in more 
detail below.
(i) Social / Diversity
After successful achievement of diversity related targets in 
previous years, the Supervisory Board decided to maintain 
such target for 2023 as well. The target was again 
focused on the appointment of female leaders in senior

Integrated Report 2023
management positions (target: at least 40%), but this year 
a second target was added to encourage and support 
appointment in commercial roles with P&L responsibility 
(at least 33%).
The reasoning for this is that the internal candidates 
for the end-responsible position in country and regional 
management within IMCD (managing directors, business 
group leaders, etc.) often have a commercial background. 
By increasing the number of female talent with this 
experience in the talent pool, it will become easier 
for IMCD to promote internal female candidates for 
these roles.
In 2023, 48% of open senior management position was 
filled  with female candidates, with 43% appointments on 
commercial or digital leadership positions. See paragraph 
4 People & Culture Value for more information. Based 
on these result, which moved the needle significantly  in 
the overall gender diversity of the sub top in IMCD, was 
awarded the maximum bonus opportunity, equalling 1.35 
months of base salary.
(ii) Sustainability
In respect of sustainability, three performance indicators 
applied covering again the topics emission calculations, 
sustainable procurement and responsible supply 
chain management.
Emission calculation methodology
In 2022, IMCD became member of Together for 
Sustainability (TfS), a round-table association for the 
chemical industry driving improvements in ESG practices. 
In November 2022, TfS published its Product Carbon 
Footprint Guideline for the Chemical Industry (the PCF 
Guideline). This guideline aims to develop a gold standard 
for the industry as a whole to work on real and meaningful 
emissions reductions. The Supervisory Board has included 
the set-up and renewal of emissions data collection 
and calculation methodology as a decarbonisation target 
for 2023.
This methodology was developed and IMCD successfully 
implemented and internal dashboard for the collection 
of emissions stemming from Scope 3 transport. The 
methodology is used for the 2023 reporting and results 
are reviewed by Deloitte. The Supervisory Board is of 
the opinion that this target was met and awarded for 'at 
target' performance (0.45 months).
Sustainable procurement / supply chain management
For this component, the Supervisory Board build on 
IMCD's commitment to increase scope and impact of 
its third party rating / assessment program. The targets 
asked for an effort  to bring at least 90% of both upstream 
and downstream suppliers in scope of the programme by 
end of 2023 (based on the prior year's purchase value). 
In addition, the target asked to define  an action plan for 
engagement with the lowest scoring supply chain partners 
to accelerate improvement. As described in paragraph 
6 Product Value, both targets were met. Hence the 
Supervisory Board awarded for 'at target' performance 
(0.45 months).
In total, the Supervisory Board has granted 2.25 months 
of base salary as a cash bonus for the non-financial  KPIs 
of 2023.
Financial STI criteria
As reported on in paragraph 3.1 Developments 2023 
and 10.4 Topics of discussion and advice IMCD was very 
active on the M&A market in 2023. Hence, the M&A 
growth exceeded the target's threshold for maximum pay-
out, leading to a bonus pay-out equalling 0.9 months of 
base salary.
Although financial  performance in 2023 remained solid, 
given the unfavourable economic conditions and weaker 
demand experiences in some of IMCD's markets, the 
short-term organic growth ambition was not achieved. 
On a linear scale performance was appr. 30% above 
the minimum threshold, leading to a bonus pay-out 
equalling 0.99 months. Below visual provides more 
insight in the relative performance compared to the 
applicable thresholds.
Operating EBITA
Thresholds for pay-out Performance 2023

threshold
Bonus amounts
Hence, the total STI bonus for 2023 granted to each 
of Piet van der Slikke, Hans Kooijmans and Marcus 
Jordan equalled 4.14 months, or 46% of the available 
opportunity. This resulted in a gross cash bonus payment 
of EUR 263,655 to the CEO, EUR 210,529 to the CFO 
and EUR 179,912 to the COO. In line with contractual 
arrangements for 2023, Valerie Diele-Braun was entitled 
to a pro rata bonus for the period October - December 
2023, at maximum level, amounting to EUR 159,375.
Long-term incentive (LTI)
The members of the Management Board receive a share 
based bonus, for which the conditions are defined  in the 
long-term incentive plan for the Management Board. The 
purpose of the LTI plan is to drive long-term performance, 
support retention and to further strengthen alignment 
with shareholders’ interests.

Integrated Report 2023
LTI structure and value
The LTI plan is structured in such a way as to 
contribute to the simplicity and transparency of IMCD’s 
overall remuneration policy. Under the LTI plan the 
Management Board members are eligible for annual 
awards of conditional performance shares, that vest after 
a three-year performance period. Vesting depends on 
achievement levels of pre-set targets and is subject to 
continued employment. An additional two-year holding 
period applies to vested shares so that shared are held 
for a minimum period of 5 years from the grant date.
The long-term incentive structure applies equally to all 
Management Board Members as follows:
LTI VARIABLE PAY STRUCTURE (% OF BASE SALARY)
Under performance (below set threshold) 0%
At target performance 100%
Maximum opportunity (capped) 150%
The conditional shares are awarded at the beginning 
of the first  year of the performance period (usually in 
the first  quarter). The number of shares is calculated 
by dividing the value of the maximum (150% of base 
salary) by the average IMCD share price in the month of 
December of the preceding year.
The Supervisory Board annually sets the targets for 
the Management Board's long-term incentive plan and 
determines their weight. The long-term incentive plan for 
the Management Board members does not include an 
award in the form of (share) options. Further details on 
the conditional shares awarded are presented below in 
paragraph 11.5 Actual remuneration paid in 2023.
LTI performance criteria for 2023
The following table shows the selected criteria and their 
weight, together with the performance ranges and pay-out 
levels that were set for the 2023 LTI plan.
CRITERIA PERFORMANCE THRESHOLDS WEIGHT
Cash EPS growth1 < 10% below target - 0%
≥ 5-10% below target 
- 50%
≤ > 5% range of target

≥ 5% above target - 150%
50%
Relative TSR in 
peer group2
• Fourth quartile - 0%
• Third quartile - 50%
• Second quartile - 100%
• First quartile - 150%
50%
1 EPS: Earnings per share
2 TSR: Total Shareholder Return
The performance parameters for the 2023 LTI Plan are 
measured over a three year performance period (financial  
years 2023-2025).
To set a realistic but ambitious Cash EPS target, the 
actual Cash EPS published over the last year before 
the award is taken as a baseline and increased with a 
compound annual growth rate for the 3 year performance 
period, in line with IMCD's long term growth ambition. 
Realisation of 10% lower Cash EPS, still requires consistent 
and significant  growth over a three year period and 
is therefore deemed a fair and appropriate threshold 
for vesting.
TSR peer group
The peer group used for the calculation of the outcome 
of the TSR component under any LTI plan comprises 
11 companies, and IMCD itself. The TSR peer group is 
reviewed and updated annually, if necessary. For the 2023 
LTI plan, the following companies were included in the 
TSR peer group. Due to its delisting, Univar Inc. will be 
replaced with Travis Perkins Plc (London Stock Exchange) 
as of the 2024 LTIP plan.

Pensions
In 2023, Piet van der Slikke and Hans Kooijmans 
participated in the "IMCD pension scheme", a collective 
career average defined  benefit  plan, insured by AEGON 
Levensverzekering N.V. In accordance with Dutch pension 
legislation, the pensionable salary is capped. In 2023, the 
cap was EUR 128,810. The pension premiums for the 
participation of the Management Board members due 
in 2023 were paid by the company. Pension rights are 
accrued for in the financial  statements in accordance with 
IFRS/IAS 19.
In lieu of a Dutch pension plan, Marcus Jordan and Valerie 
Diele-Braun receive a gross cash allowance instead.
The Supervisory Board has long been aware that the 
current pension arrangement for the Management Board 
significantly  deviates from market practice and is no 
longer sufficient  to remain competitive. This has become 
clear once more from the updated benchmark by EY, 
in preparation of the remuneration package of the 
incoming CEO. The Supervisory Board therefore used the

momentum of Valerie Diele-Braun's appointment to the 
Management Board to correct this disparity for the CFO 
and COO. As of 1 October 2023, they are each entitled to a 
gross pension contribution equalling 20% of base salary.
To enable consistency for new board members in 
the future, this change is also part of the proposed 
amendments to the Remuneration Policy and will be put 
forward to shareholders for approval in 2024.
Other benefits
Pursuant to their service agreements, the Management 
Board members receive customary fringe benefits  
including a fixed  expense allowance, fixed  contribution 
to healthcare insurance and a company car. In addition, 
Marcus Jordan and Valerie Diele-Braun receive allowances 
to cover (international) schooling and housing, due to 
their expatriations.

5-year comparison with company performance
The table on the right presents the annual change of 
Management Board remuneration, company performance 
and the average remuneration of IMCD’s employees in a 
comparative manner. As the COO position was created 
only in May 2022, no comparative year-on-year data is 
available for a five  year period.
The remuneration of a Management Board member used 
for this comparison includes the fixed  remuneration 
elements paid in each of the years 2018 up to and 
including 2023, as reported on an IFRS basis in the 
Integrated report. The STI pay-out is included in the year 
that also comprises the performance period (year 1). The 
value of vested LTI shares is included in the year in which 
the performance period ended (year 3).

1 For Management Board members the remuneration includes the base salary, pension and other benefits  paid in each of the years included in the comparison, as provided in Note 53 of the financial  statements to the Integrated report 2023. The 
STI pay-out is included in the year that also comprises the performance period (year 1). The value of vested shared under the LTI is included in the year in which the performance period ended (year 3).
2 Reported increase in 2020 compared to 2019 is a combination of inflation  adjustment base salary (+1% of total), more STI (+10% of total) and revised LTIP conditions (+34% of total).
3 In 2022, the position of COO was newly added to the Management Board. Information is therefore included to the extend available.
4 The average total compensation for IMCD employees was calculated with the numbers as reported in Note 10 (Personnel expenses) of the financial  statements to the Integrated report 2023 (wages and salaries / total average number of employees, 
excluding the members of the Management Board).
5 Acquisitions and recruitment activities in different  regions, including emerging markets, have a significant  effect  on the annual fluctuation  of the average total compensation for IMCD employees. For example, in 2018, large acquisitions in the US 
and EMEA contributed to an increase of the average employee compensation, whilst in 2019 and 2020, an increase of the number of employees in APAC and LATAM in the global mix, had a downward effect  on the average total compensation of 
IMCD employees.

Movements in share positions
The table on the right depicts the movements in the 
Management Board’s share position due to the share-
based remuneration awarded to the Management Board 
members in the past five  years. Both Marcus Jordan 
and Valerie Diele-Braun participated in the Management 
Board's LTI Plan for the first  time as of 2023, hence, no 
prior share positions are included in the overview.
2023 long-term incentive award
Under the 2023 LTI Plan the members of the Management 
Board are granted (as of today's date) 8,140 (CEO), 6,341 
(CFO) and 5,418 (COO) conditional performance shares 
respectively. This number represents the maximum 
opportunity for each member. Valerie Diele-Braun 
received a pro rata award of and 2,263 conditional shares. 
The outcome of performance for this LTI Plan will be 
reviewed at the beginning of 2026.
2024 long-term incentive award
As the decision on the 2024 LTI Plan conditional grants 
had already been made ahead of the publication of this 
Integrate Report, the information on the grants can be 
included herein.
Under the 2024 LTI Plan the members of the 
Management Board are granted (as of today's date) 
8,541 (CEO), 6,766 (CFO) and 5,782 (COO) conditional 
performance shares respectively. This number represents 
the maximum opportunity for each member. The outcome 
of performance for this LTI Plan will be reviewed at the 
beginning of 2027.
Vesting of 2020 long-term incentive
Vesting of the 2020 long term-incentive package was 
already disclosed in the prior Annual Report. With 
exceptional strong performance in the years 2020-2022, 
both performance criteria were met at or above maximum 
level. 12,694 shares vested for the CEO and 9,889 shares

1 The LTI performance period spans the period from 1 January in the first  performance year up to and including 31 December of the third year thereafter.
2 The vesting date under any LTI plan is equal to the date of the Supervisory Board’s decision that establishes the number of performance shares that make 
up the unconditional award. This decision is usually taken during the first  or second Supervisory Board meeting in the year that follows the expiration of the 
performance period.
3 Management Board members are allowed to sell shares that vested after such shares have been retained for a five-year  period from the date of the 
conditional award.
4 The number of shares provided in this column represents the maximum opportunity.
5 The number of shares provided in this column represents the gross number of shares vested under the respective LTI plan for the listed year, before deduction 
of personal income taxes.
6 As a result of the retirement of Piet van der Slikke in 2024, and termination of his services contract as of 1 April 2024, the 2022 and 2023 LTIP package will, in 
accordance with the LTI plan rules, be settled in the second quarter of 2024, on pro rata basis, by payment of a gross amount in cash in Euros.
7 As a result of the retirement of Piet van der Slikke in 2024, any outstanding unconditional award shall become unrestricted at the termination date of the 
services contract.

vested for the CFO, at a corresponding value of 150% 
of their applicable annual base salary at the time 
of granting in 2020.
To provide more insight in the overachievement of the 
Cash EPS target, it is explained herein that this target is 
derived from the actual cash EPS result in the last year 
before the conditional grant, so in this case 2019. Over 
the performance period 2020-2022, Cash EPS increased 
with 138% (from EUR 2.85 at end of 2019 to EUR 6.78 at 
end of 2022). This is unique in the history of IMCD and 
exceeds the set target, which was deemed ambitious in 
2020, by far.

Vesting of 2021 long-term incentive
As the decision on vesting of the 2021 long-term incentive 
had been made ahead of the publication of this Integrated 
Report, hence the information can be included herein. The 
‘at-target’ opportunity under the 2021 LTI Plan equalled 
100% of the Management Board members’ annual base 
salary. The maximum opportunity was capped at 150%. 
It is noted that only the CEO and CFO participated in the 
2021 LTI Plan for the Management Board.
With the exceptional strong performance in the 
years 2021 and 2022 still included in the three-year 
performance period for this LTI Plan , the Cash EPS target 
was again both performance criteria were again met 
above maximum level. Cash EPS increased with 111% over 
the performance period 2021-2023.
In respect of TSR performance , IMCD ranked third in 
the TSR group, leading to maximum vesting for this 
component as well. Hence 9,698 shares vested (as of 
today's date) for the CEO and 7,554 shares vested for the 
CFO, at a corresponding value of 150% of their applicable 
annual base salary at the time of granting in 2021.
11.6 Other remuneration information
Compliance with the remuneration policy
In 2023, the application of the remuneration policy for 
the Management Board was consistent with the policies 
included therein. No deviation or derogation took place, 
other than the adjustment of pension arrangements for 
the CFO and COO as of 1 October 2023. This change will 
be embedded in the revision of the remuneration policy in 
2024 and submitted for shareholder approval.
The Supervisory Board did not use its discretionary power 
to deviate from the mathematical outcomes based on the 
pre-set metrics and targets for the 2023 compensation.
Long-term value creation
Both the structure for the Management Board’s 
remuneration as well as the targets set by the Supervisory 
Board for the 2023 remuneration contributed to a 
focus on long-term value creation. The packages for 
the incoming CEO, CFO and COO ensure competitive 
compensation. A substantial part of the remuneration 
opportunity is made up of variable components, based on 
performance. Due to a lower bonus pay-out in 2023, the 
percentage of variable remuneration decreased, but still 
amounted to 41% on average for the full Management 
Board, as shown in the table "Remuneration costs of 
individual MB members’" on page 91).
60% of the 2023 STI bonus was made dependent on 
organic growth, ensuring a long-term mindset focused on 
sustainable growth. The non-financial  KPIs set for the 2023 
STI bonus were also geared to ensure progress on topics 
that benefit  the company's organisation in the long-term 
with, in 2023, a focus on employee engagement, diversity 
and sustainability.
Finally, the 2023 LTI programme uses a three-year period 
and financial  targets that contribute to a focus on long-
term value growth for IMCD’s shareholders.
Internal pay ratio
As per the guidance issued by the monitoring committee 
for the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the pay-
ratio used by IMCD reflects  the annual remuneration 
of all IMCD employees worldwide relative to the total 
remuneration for the CEO, including all elements (fixed  
and variable) as included in the financial  statements on 
an IFRS basis. The calculation of the pay-ratio follows the 
guidance provided by the Monitoring Committee for the 
Dutch Corporate Governance Code.

Integrated Report 2023
IMCD monitors the development of the internal pay ratio 
over multiple years and, to the extent possible, compares 
the outcome with the published pay ratios of industry 
peers, as well as other companies included in the AEX 
and AMX indices. Compared to these companies, IMCD's 
internal pay ratio is at the lower end of the spectrum.
The five  year overview above also indicated that the pay 
ratio remains relatively stable within a broad range of 20 
to 30. The overview shows as well that the pay ratio is 
quickly impacted by a variety of factors in a given year; 
not only the pay-out of bonuses - for both management 
and employees -, but also acquisition-effects  in case of 
significant  growth in regions that have an impact on the 
total employee remuneration mix.
Due to aforementioned reasons, the Supervisory Board 
does not deem it valuable to set a specific  range for the 
pay ratio. It feels that the current pay ratio is reasonable 
and will continue to review the ratio annually as a 
relevant factor for the assessment of the Management 
Board remuneration.
Information on shareholder advisory vote
At the 2023 AGM, the 2022 Remuneration Report was 
subject to an advisory vote. It was again received well, with 
89.3% approval (2022: 91.01% ).
It is considered a positive sign that the report 
again received a high approval rate. However, in the 
engagement meetings that took place in 2023 to receive 
input for the renewed approval of the remuneration 
policies, IMCD also received further suggestions for 
improvements. In response, this report includes enhanced 
disclosure and visibility of the relative performance 
compared against the set targets, allowing stakeholders 
to have a better understanding that targets were set to be 
sufficiently  challenging and ambitious.
11.7 Remuneration of the Supervisory 
Board
The remuneration of the members of the Supervisory 
Board is determined by the General Meeting. It is not 
dependent on the company's results and none of the 
members of the Supervisory Board receive shares, options 
for shares or similar rights to acquire shares as part of 
their remuneration.
The General Meeting of Shareholders approved a revision 
of the annual fixed  fees for the Supervisory Board's 
remuneration in 2022. The fees are listed in the following 
table and applied during the year.
Compliance with the policy
In 2023, the application of the remuneration policy for 
the Supervisory Board was consistent with the policies 
included therein. No deviation or derogation took place.

11.8 Other policy information
 
Scenario analysis
Scenarios concerning the possible outcomes of the 
variable components and their impact on the 
remuneration of the Management Board members 
are analysed annually and taken into consideration 
by the Remuneration Committee and the Supervisory 
Board. The scenarios reviewed include minimum (0%), 
at target (100%) and maximum (150%) variable pay-
out achievement.

remuneration package annually and/or in case of any 
proposed changes to the remuneration packages. In 2023 
this took place on multiple occasions during the year and 
has led to an interim adjustment of the packages of the 
CFO and COO.
Term of appointment
Management Board members are, in principle, appointed 
for a term of four years. The (total) term of employment 
of Management Board members is not limited in any way. 
Valerie Diele-Braun is appointed for a first  term as of her 
start as CEO in 2024, hence, expiring in 2028 (at the date 
of the AGM).
Hans Kooijmans was re-appointed for another four-year 
term in 2022, expiring at the date of the 2026 AGM. At the 
same time, Marcus Jordan was appointed as new member 
to the Management Board in the role of COO, also for a 
(first)  term of four years.
Revision and claw back of variable pay
The Supervisory Board may adjust the amount or value 
of an STI or LTI awarded to a Management Board 
member to a suitable level if payment or fulfilment  of 
that award would be unacceptable under the standards of 
reasonableness and fairness.
There is also a claw-back provision in place which 
may be applied to payments made to members of the 
Management Board (in cash, in kind or in the form 
of securities) under an STI or LTI award. In 2023, no 
adjustment or claw-back occurred.
Severance compensation
In accordance with Dutch law and the Code, the service 
agreements with the Management Board members 
contain provisions related to severance arrangements 
with a maximum payment of the gross fixed  annual salary, 
subject to a fairness review.
In case of retirement, any outstanding LTI plan for the 
respective Management Board member shall be settled 
within two months after termination of the management 
agreement, on a pro rata basis. The Supervisory Board 
will assess the pro rata fulfilment  of the performance 
conditions for the performance period up to the date of 
termination, to determine the number of shares that vest.
Supervisory Board members are appointed or 
reappointed in accordance with applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements. Their engagement does not 
include any severance payment, claw-back or change in 
control provisions.
Notice period
The service agreements with the members of the 
Management Board can be terminated by both parties, 
subject to a six-month notice period.
No loans
IMCD nor any of its group companies has provided any 
loans, advances or guarantees for the benefit  of the 
members of the Management Board or the members of 
the Supervisory Board.
11.9 Looking ahead 2024
In January 2024, the base salaries of the members of the 
Management Board were corrected for inflation.  Based 
on the provisions of the management contracts, this 
correction is equal to the inflation  rate in the Dutch 
Consumer Price Index (CPI) set by Statistics Netherlands 
(Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek). For Valerie Diele-Braun 
a pro rata percentage applied (taking account the three 
month duration of her appointment in 2023).
IMCD has during 2023 worked on a revision of 
the remuneration policies for the Management Bard 
and Supervisory Board, which will be presented to 
the shareholders for approval during the 2024 AGM. 
More information will be made available in the 
AGM documentation.
For the 2024 LTI plan, the Supervisory Board has decided 
to re-include Travis Perkins Plc (London Stock Exchange) 
to the TSR peer group, upon deletion of Univar Inc. due to 
its delisting.
Aside from the foreseen update of the remuneration 
policies, no other changes or amendments are expected 
to take place in 2024.

Integrated Report 2023
12 Corporate governance
IMCD N.V., a public company 
with limited liability (naamloze 
vennootschap) organised under Dutch 
law, is the parent company of the IMCD 
group. IMCD N.V. has a two-tier board 
structure, consisting of a Management 
Board under the supervision of a 
Supervisory Board.
The two boards are independent 
of each other and are accountable 
to the Annual General Meeting of 
Shareholders (General Meeting) for 
the performance of their duties. The 
Management Board has chosen to work 
with an Executive Committee.
12.1 Governance structure
IMCD N.V.’s corporate governance framework is regulated 
by the company's Articles of Association (available on the 
company's website), the requirements of the Dutch Civil 
Code, the Dutch Corporate Governance Code (the 'Code'), 
the Dutch Financial Markets Supervision Act and any other 
applicable laws and regulations. The Dutch ‘large company 
regime’ (structuurregime) does not apply to IMCD.
IMCD’s corporate governance structure was formalised 
and approved by the General Meeting at the time of 
IMCD's listing, on 26 June 2014. The key aspects of IMCD's 
corporate governance structure and compliance with the 
Code were presented and discussed with shareholders 
during the Annual General Meeting (AGM) in 2018 and 
again in 2022.
IMCD is committed to a governance structure that best 
and most effectively  supports its business, meets the 
needs of its stakeholders and complies with all relevant 
rules and regulations.
In this section, the company addresses the main elements 
of its corporate governance structure, reports on how 
it applies the principles and best practices of the Dutch 
Corporate Governance Code and provides the information 
required by the Dutch government's decrees on Corporate 
Governance and Article 10 Takeover Directive. Deviations 
from aspects of the corporate governance structure of the 
company, when deemed necessary in the interest of the 
company, will be disclosed in this section as well.
12.2 Management Board
The Management Board manages the day-to-day 
operations of IMCD and is responsible for designing 
and achieving the company's objectives and strategy. 
Whilst doing so, it focuses on long-term sustainable value 
creation for the company and its business, and takes the 
relevant stakeholders’ interests into account.
The Management Board represents the company and acts 
in accordance with the Articles of Association and the 
Management Board Rules (available on the company's 
website), which provide a detailed description of the 
Management Board's responsibilities and functioning. 
Certain important resolutions of the Management 
Board identified  in the Articles of Association require 
the approval of the Supervisory Board and/or the 
General Meeting.
Appointment
Management Board members are appointed (and may be 
reappointed) for a term of up to four years by the General 
Meeting in accordance with a binding nomination by the 
Supervisory Board. The General Meeting can overrule 
the binding character of the nomination by an absolute 
majority of votes cast that represent at least one-third of 
the issued share capital.
The Management Board has been designated, most 
recently by the AGM in 2023, as the corporate body 
authorised to issue shares and/or grant rights to acquire 
shares up to 10% of the total number of issued shares, 
and to restrict or exclude pre-emptive rights pertaining 
to such issue of shares, subject to the prior approval 
of the Supervisory Board. The AGM also authorised the 
Management Board to purchase shares in the company 
up to a maximum of 10% of the issued shares, subject to 
the prior approval of the Supervisory Board.
Both authorisations are given for a period of 18 months. 
No authorisation from the General Meeting is required for 
the acquisition of fully paid-up shares for the purpose of

or of an IMCD group company under any employee 
share plan.
Composition
The Supervisory Board determines the number of 
members in the Management Board. As of 1 October 
2023, the Management Board consisted of four members 
holding joint responsibility. As of 1 January 2024, 
upon the retirement of Piet van der Slikke, the 
composition of the Management Board will return to three 
members. The members of the Management Board hold 
joint responsibility.
Diversity
The company's diversity objectives described on page 104
apply to the Management Board.
In 2023, the appointment of Valerie Diele-Braun to 
succeed Piet van der Slikke as CEO of IMCD as of 
2024, contributed to further diversity in the Management 
Board, in line with the diversity policy for, amongst 
other, the Management Board. With this appointment, the 
Management Board will, as of January 2024, also meet the 
set gender diversity objective of at least 1/3rd men and at 
least 1/3rd women.
Remuneration
The remuneration of the individual members of the 
Management Board is determined by the Supervisory 
Board based on the remuneration policy adopted by 
the General Meeting. The remuneration policy for the 
Management Board was lastly reviewed and adopted by 
the AGM in 2020, with 94.85% of votes cast in favour, and 
is available on the company's website.
In 2023, the Remuneration Committee, on behalf of 
the Supervisory Board engaged with stakeholders on 
the foreseen revision and adoption of an updated 
remuneration policy for the Management Board, to be 
voted on by the General Meeting during the AGM in 2024.
More information on the policy and Management Board 
remuneration in 2023, is available in the Remuneration 
report included herein on page 85 and onwards.
In compliance with the Code, the service agreements 
with Management Board members contain provisions on 
severance arrangements, claw-back and public offering  
consequences. An overview of the key terms of each 
Management Board member's contract was shared with 
the General Meeting prior to their appointment. These 
overviews are available on the company's website.
Outside positions
Members of the Management Board must inform the 
Supervisory Board before accepting positions outside 
of the company. Acceptance by a member of the 
Management Board of a position as supervisory director 
of a listed company requires the approval of the 
Supervisory Board.

Integrated Report 2023
12.3 Executive Committee
The structure in which the Management Board is 
supported by an Executive Committee was formalised 
in 2011. At the time, this structure was chosen as a 
means of ensuring an efficient  flow  of - commercial 
and strategic - business information to the Management 
Board, while allowing the Management Board to remain 
small. In addition, the Executive Committee serves as 
a sounding board to the Management Board, making 
recommendations and providing guidance and support on 
strategy implementation.
Responsibilities
The responsibilities of the Executive Committee include 
group performance, realisation of operational and 
financial  objectives, people strategy and identification  and 
management of risks connected to the business activities. 
The non-Management Board members of the Executive 
Committee may take on certain management activities 
at group level in addition to their specific  Managing 
Director or Business Group Director roles and support 
the Management Board in the implementation of the 
company's group policies throughout the organisation. 
IMCD's Executive Committee also takes on an active role 
in promoting and shaping the company's culture, and by 
play a vital role in shaping and maintaining IMCD's culture 
and communicating and promoting the company's values 
across the organisation.
The Management Board remains accountable for the 
actions and decisions of the Executive Committee and 
has ultimate responsibility for the company's external 
reporting and reporting to the company's shareholders.
The Management Board is supported by an Executive 
Committee, which is responsible for, among other things, 
regional operations and certain general group-level 
management activities.
Appointment
The non-Management Board members of the Executive 
Committee are appointed by the Management Board.
Composition
During 2023, the Executive Committee consisted of three 
members next to the members of the Management 
Board. Due to retirement of Piet van der Slikke and 
the appointment of two new members to the Executive 
Committee in January 2024, the Executive Committee will 
increase to eight members.
Diversity
The company's diversity objectives described on page 104
also apply to the Executive Committee. At the end of 
2023, gender diversity in the Executive Committee was 
14% female and 86% male. Due to retirement of Piet van 
der Slikke and the appointment of two new members to 
the Executive Committee in January 2024, gender diversity 
increased to 25% female and 75% male. By 2030, the 
company aims for a composition including at least 1/3rd 
men and at least 1/3rd women.
The Executive Committee members are also included in 
the sub-top of senior managers in IMCD, which, at the 
end of 2023, consisted of 412 positions (2022: 370), for 
which IMCD has defined  a separate (gender) diversity 
target in line with applicable Dutch legislation. By end of 
year, the sub-top included 227 women (2022: 155), i.e. 
44% (2022: 42%).
Interaction
The Supervisory Board engages with the members of 
the Executive Committee during its Supervisory Board 
meetings and/or work visits, as well as in informal contact 
outside of such meetings. In December 2023, all members 
of the Executive Committee, as well as the candidates for 
appointment were present during the Supervisory Board 
meeting, where, amongst other things, budget, strategy 
and risk management were discussed.

Integrated Report 2023
12.4 Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board monitors and supervises the 
activities of the Management Board and the general 
course of business within IMCD. It also supports the 
Management Board with advice. In performing their 
duties, the Supervisory Board members are guided by 
the interests of the company and the business of the 
group, taking into consideration the relevant interests 
of stakeholders.
The Supervisory Board, in the two-tier corporate structure 
under Dutch law, is a separate body that is independent of 
the Management Board. The members of the Supervisory 
Board are jointly responsible for the functioning of the 
Supervisory Board and assess its performance internally 
on a regular basis.
The Supervisory Board Rules are available on the 
company's website. For details on the activities of the 
Supervisory Board in 2023 see the Supervisory Board 
report and the Remuneration report as included herein.
Appointment
The members of the Supervisory Board are appointed 
by the General Meeting in accordance with a binding 
nomination by the Supervisory Board. The General 
Meeting may overrule the binding character of the 
nomination by an absolute majority of the votes cast, 
representing at least one-third of the issued share capital.
Members of the Supervisory Board are appointed for a 
term of four years and may be reappointed for a second 
term of four years. Thereafter, two additional extensions 
are possible of two years each, bringing the total term of 
office  to a maximum of 12 years.
Composition
The composition of the Supervisory Board is such that the 
combined experience, expertise and independence of its 
members enables the Supervisory Board to best carry out 
the full scope of the Supervisory Board's responsibilities. 
The profile  for Supervisory Board members is available 
on the company's website. The composition of the 
Supervisory Board shall also be in accordance with the 
best practice provisions on independence of the Code as 
well as Dutch statutory restrictions on the overall number 
of other positions that Supervisory Board members 
may hold.
During 2023, the Supervisory Board consisted of five  
members. Upon the announcement of Valerie Diele-
Braun's nomination to succeed Piet van der Slikke as CEO, 
a search for a successor in her position in the Supervisory 
Board was initiated. This has resulted in the appointment 
of Dorthe Mikkelsen to the Supervisory Board by the 
General Meeting in the EGM held on 27 November 2023.
Supervisory Board committees
In 2023, the Supervisory Board was supported by three 
committees: the Audit Committee, the Remuneration 
Committee and the Nomination and Appointment 
Committee. Each of the committees has a preparatory 
and/or advisory role for the Supervisory Board. They 
report their findings  to the full Supervisory Board, which is 
ultimately responsible for all decision-making.
Information on the work and composition of the 
committees during 2023 is set out in the relevant section 
Supervisory Board committees of the Supervisory Board 
report of this Integrated Report. Each committee has 
established rules describing its role, responsibilities and 
functioning. These committee rules are published on the 
company's website (as annex to the Supervisory Board 
Rules). Each committee is composed of at least two 
Supervisory Board members.
Diversity
The company's diversity objectives described on page 104
also apply to the Supervisory Board. In line with the 
company's gender diversity objectives, the Supervisory 
Board is currently comprised of two women and 
three men. With this composition, IMCD's Supervisory 
Board meets the binding quota for gender diversity in 
supervisory boards (at least 1/3 women and 1/3 men) 
imposed by the new Dutch legislation on gender diversity 
in boardrooms that entered into force on 1 January 2022.
Remuneration of the Supervisory Board
The General Meeting determines the remuneration of 
the members of the Supervisory Board. A written 
Remuneration Policy for the Supervisory Board was 
adopted by the General Meeting in 30 June 2020, with 
99.94% of votes cast in favour. This policy is available on 
the company's website.
The guiding principle is that remuneration of the 
Supervisory Board may not be made dependent on the 
company's results. No member of the Supervisory Board 
shall receive shares, share options or similar rights to 
acquire shares as part of their remuneration.
With the remuneration policy for the Supervisory Board, 
the company aims to attract, motivate and retain highly 
skilled individuals with the right balance of qualities, 
capabilities, profile  and experience, as may be needed 
from time to time to oversee the company's strategy, 
strategy implementation and performance, as well as 
to act as advisors to the members of the Management 
Board in support of their focus on long-term growth and 
sustainable success of the company and its business.

12.5 Diversity Supervisory Board, 
Management Board, Executive 
Committee
IMCD recognises the importance of diversity throughout 
its organisation and believes that the company's business 
activities benefit  from a wide range of skills and a 
variety of backgrounds and nationalities. This principle 
also applies to the senior management of the company. 
A diverse composition contributes to a well-balanced 
decision-making process and the proper functioning of the 
respective board or committee.
In respect of the Supervisory Board, Management Board 
and Executive Committee, IMCD aims for a diverse 
composition that ensures complementarity of knowledge, 
skills and experience, enabling each of the members to 
make a valuable contribution to achieving the company's 
strategic and business objectives. When considering 
candidates for positions in these bodies, IMCD will take 
into account gender, age and geographic background 
or nationality, as well as complementary expertise and 
experience, and the (expected) team dynamics. These 
principles are included in IMCD's D&I Policy that is 
available on the company's website.
In line with Dutch legislation on gender diversity in 
boards, IMCD has set appropriate and ambitious targets 
for gender diversity on its Management Board and 
among its senior management. For the Supervisory Board, 
Management Board and Executive Committee, IMCD aims 
for a composition including at least 1/3rd men and at least 
1/3rd women.
At the end of 2023, the Supervisory Board's composition 
was in line with the set target. For the Management 
Board the composition will be in line with the set target 
as of January 2024. In the Executive Committee, with 
two additional new members as of January 2024, gender 
diversity has increased to 25% female and 75% male. 
The aim is to further increase gender diversity, as well 
as representation of members with a non-European 
background, by 2030.
Of the senior management positions identified  below 
the Management Board, consisting of a group of 412 
employees at year-end 2023 (2022: 370), 44% were held 
by women (2022: 42%). Of the senior management roles 
with P&L responsibility, 31% were held by women (2022: 
29%). The target is to improve this ratio to at least 40% by 
end of 2025.
12.6 Shareholders and their rights
Rights on shares
The authorised capital of the company comprises a single 
class of registered shares. All shares are traded via the 
giro-based securities transfer system and are registered 
under the name and address of Euroclear. All issued 
shares are fully paid up and each share holds the right 
to cast a single vote in the General Meeting.
Shares held by IMCD are non-voting shares and do not 
count when calculating the amount to be distributed on 
shares or the attendance at a General Meeting. IMCD 
purchases shares to hedge its obligations arising from 
conditionally awarded performance shares under IMCD’s 
long-term incentive plan.
General Meeting
IMCD shareholders may exercise their rights through 
annual and extraordinary general meetings of 
shareholders (the General Meeting). The Annual General 
Meeting (AGM) is held each year before July. In 2023, it 
took place on 26 April 2023.
Extraordinary General Meetings (EGM) are held as often 
as the Management Board and/or the Supervisory Board 
deem desirable. In addition, one or more shareholders, 
who solely or jointly represent at least one-tenth of the 
issued capital, may request that a General Meeting be 
convened. Notice of General Meetings is given no later 
than 42 days before the day of the meeting through the 
publication of a convocation notice on the IMCD website. 
In 2023, one EGM took place, on 27 November 2023.
Shareholders representing, either solely or jointly with 
other shareholders, at least 3% of the issued share capital 
may request the company to put an item on the agenda, 
provided that the company has received the request no 
later than on the 60th day prior to the date of the 
General Meeting.
Each shareholder may attend General Meetings, address 
the General Meeting and exercise voting rights pro rata 
to their shareholding, either in person or by proxy. 
Shareholders may exercise these rights if they are the 
holders of shares on the record date, which is the 28th 
day before the date of the General Meeting, and provided 
they or their proxy have notified  the company of their 
intention to attend the General Meeting.
Subject to certain exceptions set forth by law or in the 
Articles of Association, resolutions of the General Meeting 
are passed by an absolute majority of votes cast.
The powers of the General Meeting are specified  in 
the Articles of Association and include adoption of 
IMCD's financial  statements, appointment and dismissal 
of Supervisory Board and Management Board members 
and the allocation of profit,  insofar as it is at the 
disposal of the General Meeting. Resolutions to amend 
the Articles of Association or to dissolve the company may 
only be taken by the General Meeting upon a proposal

of the Management Board with the approval of the 
Supervisory Board.
Authorisations relating to share issuance 
and purchase
The Management Board has been designated, most 
recently by the 2023 AGM, as the corporate body 
authorised to issue shares and/or grant rights to acquire 
shares up to 10% of the total number of issued shares, 
and to restrict or exclude pre-emptive rights pertaining to 
such issue of shares, subject to the prior approval of the 
Supervisory Board.
The AGM also authorised the Management Board to 
purchase shares in the company, up to a maximum of 
10% of the issued shares, subject to the prior approval of 
the Supervisory Board. Both authorisations are given for a 
period of 18 months.
No authorisation from the General Meeting is required for 
the acquisition of fully paid up shares for the purpose of 
transferring these shares to employees of the company 
or of an IMCD group company under any employee 
share plan.
Anti-takeover mechanisms
IMCD respects the one-share/one-vote principle and did 
not have any anti-takeover or control mechanisms in place 
in 2023.
Shareholder dialogue
IMCD recognises and acknowledges the importance of 
having a meaningful dialogue with its stakeholders on 
their interests, concerns, and expectations for IMCD. In 
2023, a stakeholder dialogue policy was formulated, which 
is available on IMCD's website. Shareholders and potential 
shareholders are identified  as stakeholder in the category 
Investors & Financial Markets. More information on the 
main topics and fora for engagement is included in the 
IMCD Stakeholder Dialogue Policy.
In addition, in accordance with best practice provision 
4.2.2 of the Code, IMCD also has a Policy on bilateral 
contacts with shareholders, which is also available on 
IMCD's website. The purpose of bilateral contacts with 
shareholders and potential shareholders is to explain 
the strategy and performance of IMCD, in support of 
correct and adequate information being disseminated 
about the company.
12.7 Conflicts of interest
All legal transactions where a conflict  of interest exists or 
could arise with regards to members of the Management 
Board must be handled on arm’s-length terms and must 
be approved by the Supervisory Board. Each Management 
Board member or Supervisory Board member is required 
to immediately disclose any potential direct or indirect 
personal conflict  of interest to the Chair of the Supervisory 
Board, providing all relevant information.
If the Chair of the Supervisory Board determines that 
there is a conflict  of interest, the member of the 
Management Board or the Supervisory Board with the 
conflict  of interest may not take part in any discussion 
or decision-making that involves a subject or transaction 
relating to the conflict  of interest.
In 2023, no transactions with third parties were reported 
or identified  involving actual or potential conflicts  of 
interest involving a member of the Management Board 
or Supervisory Board, nor were there any transactions 
with shareholders owning more than 10% of the shares. 
In relation to other subjects of deliberation, Mrs. Valerie 
Diele-Braun stepped down and abstained from the 
Supervisory Board committees she was a member of, and 
did not take part in any Supervisory Board deliberations 
concerning or connected to the succession process, whilst 
she was a candidate in the selection process (in line 
with clause 2:140 DCC, and 10.3 and 10.6 Supervisory 
Board Rules).
12.8 Insider trading - share ownership
IMCD has implemented measures to comply with the 
provisions of the Financial Markets Supervision Act and 
the EU Market Abuse Regulation intended to prevent 
market abuse, such as insider trading, tipping and market 
manipulation. In addition, the company maintains rules 
regarding the reporting and regulation of transactions 
in IMCD shares or other IMCD financial  instruments. 
The IMCD insider trading rules are kept up to date to 
reflect  legislative developments and apply to members 
of the Management Board, the Executive Committee, the 
Supervisory Board and other designated persons within 
IMCD. The IMCD insider trading rules are available on the 
company's website.
IMCD has established a Disclosure Committee to manage 
the disclosure of inside information and to ensure 
compliance with regulatory requirements regarding all 
disclosures and filings  to be made to the Dutch Authority 
for the Financial Markets, Euronext Amsterdam N.V. 
and any other relevant stock exchange or supervisory 
authority. The Disclosure Committee meets periodically 
throughout the year.
More information on the share ownership by members of 
the Management Board is provided in the Remuneration 
report. Information on share-ownership by members of 
the Supervisory Board is disclosed in the Supervisory 
Board report.

12.9 External auditor
Under Dutch law, the external auditor of the company is 
appointed by the General Meeting. In accordance with the 
Dutch Corporate Governance Code and Regulation (EU) 
537/2014, the Supervisory Board selects and nominates 
an external auditor for appointment, upon advice from 
the Audit Committee. The Supervisory Board and the 
Audit Committee assess the functioning of the external 
auditor, taking the observations of the Management 
Board into account.
In 2023, the General Meeting re-appointed Deloitte 
Accountants B.V. as the external auditor of the company 
for the financial  year 2024. After this year, an audit firm  
rotation takes place. Ernst & Young Accountants LLP was 
appointed as external auditor for a period of three tears, 
covering the financial  years 2025, 2026 and 2027.
In principle, the external auditor attends all meetings 
of the Audit Committee. The findings  of the external 
auditor, the audit approach and the risk analysis are 
also discussed at these meetings. The external auditor 
attends the meeting of the Supervisory Board in which the 
report of the external auditor on the audit of the financial  
accounts is discussed, and in which the annual accounts 
are approved.
Auditor independence
The Audit Committee evaluates the external auditor's 
independence at least annually . The lead auditor of the 
IMCD account is changed at least every five  years. Such a 
change took place with effect  from the financial  year 2021.
Furthermore, Dutch law requires a mandatory rotation of 
the external audit firm  after it has performed the statutory 
audits of the company for a period of 10 consecutive 
years. Such change is approved by the AGM in 2023 and 
will take place in 2025.
Prohibition on non-audit services
The Audit Committee reviews the proposed audit scope, 
approach and fees as well as the services that the external 
auditor provides to the company. Dutch law requires the 
separation of audit and non-audit services, meaning that 
the company's external auditor is not allowed to provide 
prohibited non-audit services.
12.10 Internal audit
IMCD's internal audit function aims to provide 
independent and objective assurance, as well as perform 
consulting activities, designed to add value to and improve 
IMCD’s operations as well as its system of internal 
controls. The internal auditors perform audits for the 
financial  and non-financial  management systems, as well 
as additional reviews of staff  functions.
Audits are scheduled in close cooperation with the CFO 
and the business. Each audit is followed by a written 
audit report, issued to the local management responsible, 
with copy to the management board.  A summary of 
audit-related topics (findings,  follow-up, and so on) are 
discussed every quarter with the Management Board 
and every 6 months with the Audit Committee and 
the external auditor. The audit planning, quality and 
professionalism of the audit team and the effectiveness  
and efficiency  of the execution of the audits are 
supervised by the Management Board and approved by 
the Audit Committee. The internal audit function reports 
to the Management Board, with open communication to 
the Audit Committee.
12.11 Accountability Code
As of 2023, the new Dutch Corporate Governance 
Code, as published in December 2022, applied to IMCD. 
Throughout the year, IMCD worked to implement, were 
needed the changes in the Code in its procedures and 
processes. The implementation was discussed end of 
year with the Management Board, Supervisory Board and 
relevant committees.
Taking the implementation into account, IMCD at the 
end of the year complied with the principles and best 
practices of the (new) Code with the exception of the 
following deviation.
Retirement rota (2.2.4 Code)
Due to appointments that took place in 2020, three 
Supervisory Board members will be up for retirement 
or reappointment in 2024. With the appointment of 
Dorthe Mikkelsen, this number was reduced to two. 
However, with the foreseen reappointment of Janus 
Smalbraak (for a two year term), it is likely that in 
2026, three Supervisory Board members are again up 
for simultaneous retirement. In its decision to nominate 
Mr. Smalbraak for reappointment, the Supervisory Board 
valued continuity in its composition over diversifying the 
retirement rota by using shorter appointment terms. In 
future appointments, adjusted terms for new Supervisory 
Board appointments will be reconsidered.
Internal Audit (1.3.5 Code)
The Internal Auditor reports to the full Management 
Board and in day-to-day operations to IMCD's CFO.
The Corporate Governance Declaration is available at 
IMCD's website.

13 Risk factors and risk management
In achieving its objectives, IMCD 
faces risks and uncertainties, including 
those that are due to macroeconomic 
conditions, regional and local market 
developments and internal factors. 
IMCD strives to identify and control 
those risks and uncertainties as early 
as possible. Risk management is an 
essential element in IMCD's corporate 
governance and is embedded in the 
company's business processes.
Although the company recognises the risks and 
uncertainties associated with its business activities, IMCD 
believes that the broad diversity of its business in terms 
of product portfolio, geographies, suppliers, end-market 
sectors and customers can lessen the impact of local 
and regional economic changes. However, if adverse 
circumstances are pronounced and/or long lasting, they 
can have a significant  impact on the company's business 
and the results of its operations. IMCD is affected  by 
demand fluctuations  and other developments in the 
broader economy and weak economic conditions may 
have a material adverse effect  on the group.
IMCD's risk management policy is aimed at striking 
the best balance between maximisation of business 
opportunities in the context of the company's strategy, 
and managing the risks involved.
IMCD distinguishes the following risk categories in its risks 
management framework:
FINANCIAL
STRATEGIC
OPERATIONALCOM PLIANCE
Risk appetite
IMCD's risk appetite varies by risk category and by type of 
risk. The risk appetite per risk category is as follows:
 
 STRATEGIC Moderate
  OPERATIONAL Low
  
COMPLIANCE Low
 
 FINANCIAL Low
• Strategic: in pursuing its strategy, IMCD is prepared to 
accept moderate risk, including the exploration of new 
business opportunities and possibilities for acquisitions 
and expansion
• Operational: with respect to operational risks, IMCD 
seeks to minimise the risks of unforeseen operational 
failures within its businesses
• Compliance: with respect to compliance risks, IMCD 
pursues a risk-averse strategy. IMCD strives to 
comply with all applicable laws and regulations, 
with a particular focus on health, safety and 
environmental laws
• Financial: with respect to financial  risks, IMCD 
maintains a cautious financing  structure and conducts 
a stringent cash management policy

Integrated Report 2023
Risk management framework
Although IMCD benefits  from its geographical, market, 
client and product portfolio spread, IMCD’s well-structured 
risk management process is designed to manage 
the residual risks in a transparent and controlled 
manner. IMCD’s comprehensive internal control and 
risk management systems, including supporting tools, 
are continuously monitored by the Supervisory Board, 
Management Board, Corporate Control, Internal Audit 
and by regional and local management, improved when 
required and modified  in line with changes in internal and 
external conditions.
In 2021, Corporate Control in cooperation with Internal 
Audit completely reworked the IMCD risk and control 
framework by means of a bottom-up approach. Meetings 
were held with all department leaders to identify all 
potential risks that each department is subject to. This 
included the identification  of climate change-related risks 
and the impact of (future) regulations with regard to 
climate change. This risk overview was shared with a 
group of key internal stakeholders to rate the risks 
for the probability of each risk occurring and its 
potential impact at various levels. Furthermore, the risks 
were classified  in the respective categories (strategic, 
operational, compliance and financial).  The key risks 
resulting from this review were added to the framework 
and appropriate control measures were allocated or 
redefined  for risk mitigation purposes.
The resulting revised IMCD risk and control framework 
was put in place at the end of 2021. In 2023, the 
risk and control framework was further updated as 
part of continuous improvements of IMCD's risk and 
control management.
Risk management tasks 
and responsibilities
IMCD’s risk management and control systems are 
designed to identify and analyse the risks faced by the 
group at various levels, to determine and implement 
appropriate risk controls, and to monitor risks and 
the way the risks are controlled. Climate change 
risks are identified  and managed using the same risk 
management process.
Key activities in IMCD's risk management and control 
systems are:
• identification  of key business risks, based on their 
probability and their potential impact
• setting and maintaining key controls for managing and 
preventing the key risks
The Management Board, under supervision of the 
Supervisory Board, has overall responsibility for the IMCD 
risk management and control systems. Management of 
regional holding and operating companies is responsible 
for operational performance and compliance and for 
managing the associated local risks.
Risk management elements
The elements of IMCD’s risk management system are 
the following:
1. Control environment, including:
• organisational culture based on ethical conduct and 
compliance, clear responsibilities and short and open 
lines of communication
• IMCD group policies including business principles, 
management instructions and manuals
• continuous compliance training of employees
• risk management embedded in the business processes 
at all levels of the organisation
2. Risk assessment and control procedures, including:
• identification  of risks via risk self-assessments, 
coordinated by Corporate Control and Corporate 
HSEQR and Sustainability
• implementation and optimisation of effective  and 
efficient  control procedures at various levels of 
the organisation
3. Information, communication and monitoring, including:
• harmonised reporting on operations, financial  results, 
financial  positions and key risks
• periodical monitoring and reviews of financial  results 
and risk management by corporate management
• periodical reviews on HSEQR management by 
corporate HSEQR
• regular review meetings between corporate and 
local management
• internal audits conducted by IMCD's internal auditors
The Management Board is responsible for establishing 
and maintaining adequate internal risk management and 
control systems. Such systems are developed to manage

risks, but cannot provide absolute certainty that human 
errors, losses, fraud and breaches of laws and regulations 
will be prevented. Management has assessed whether 
IMCD's risk management and control systems provide 
reasonable assurance that the financial  reporting does not 
contain any material misstatements.
Based on the approach outlined above, the Management 
Board is of the opinion that, to the best of its knowledge, 
the internal risk management and control systems are 
adequately designed and operated effectively  in the year 
under review and hence provide reasonable assurance 
that the financial  statements are free of material 
misstatements.
Significant risks and uncertainties
In the following section, the main risks and the way IMCD 
manages these risks are described. None of the significant  
risks and uncertainties materially affected  IMCD's position. 
We decided not to include the pandemic risk separately, 
as we perceive this as an important factor affecting  
the risks that have already been identified  in the past.

RISK RISK DESCRIPTION RISK MEASURES
Decline in customer demand IMCD’s business depends on its customers’ demand for chemicals used in the 
manufacture of a wide array of products, which in turn is driven by demand from 
consumers and other end users for the products made by IMCD's customers. To a 
large extent, demand levels depend on macroeconomic conditions at a global level. 
This was highlighted in particular in recent years by the COVID-19 pandemic and 
geopolitical tensions. An improvement or deterioration in levels of economic activity 
and consumer demand tends to be reflected  in the overall level of production and 
consumption of chemicals.
The broad diversity of IMCD's business in terms of product portfolio, geographies, 
suppliers, end-market sectors and customers can lessen the impact of local and 
regional economic changes. However, if these changes are pronounced and/or long 
lasting, they can have a significant  impact on the company's business and the results 
of its operations.
Supplier dependency IMCD depends on its suppliers to develop and supply the product portfolio that 
it markets, sells and distributes. Shortages in supply of certain products or non-
competitiveness of product lines could negatively affect  operating results. Termination 
of a major supplier relationship could have a material adverse effect  on the company’s 
product portfolio, sales volumes, revenues and profit  margins.
Maintaining close relationships with supply partners is essential for IMCD in achieving 
its growth strategy. By acting in an open and transparent way towards its suppliers 
and with a focus on growing suppliers' product brands, IMCD seeks to maintain long-
term relationships.
Acquisition and 
integration risk
Execution of IMCD’s strategy will require the continued pursuit of acquisitions and 
investments and will depend on the company's ability to identify suitable acquisition 
candidates and investment opportunities.
Acquisitions and investments involve risks, including assumptions about revenues 
and costs being inaccurate, unknown liabilities and customer or key employee losses 
at the acquired businesses, potentially leading to impairment losses on intangible 
assets recognised. Moreover, successful acquisitions depend on swift integration of 
the acquiree into the company, both organisationally and culturally level.
IMCD tries to limit these risks by diligent identification  of targets and by applying strict 
selection criteria, including determining the cultural and organisational fit  with the 
company. This is followed by a structured implementation of the acquisition, including 
determining the structure of the transaction, thorough due diligence and the contract 
and integration process. Acquisition activities are driven centrally by an experienced 
management team supported by external consultants.

Operational
RISK RISK DESCRIPTION RISK MEASURES
Availability of and 
dependency on 
key personnel
IMCD relies to a significant  extent on the skills and experience of its 
managerial staff  and technical and sales personnel. Loss of such individuals 
or the failure to recruit high-quality managers and other key personnel, both 
when expanding the group's operations and when replacing people who leave 
IMCD, could have a material adverse effect  on the performance of the group.
IMCD limits these risks by providing an inspiring and entrepreneurial working environment, offering  
international career opportunities, performance-based incentive schemes and long-term succession 
planning. In addition, in order to secure the valuable relationships with key suppliers and key 
customers, these relationships are maintained by commercial teams rather than by individual 
commercial staff  members. 
Cybercrime and 
ICT continuity
IMCD's information technology infrastructure including its information and 
communication technology systems are key for managing and operating the 
business. Severe damage to and interruptions of those systems caused by 
natural disasters, software viruses, malware, cyberattacks or other threats 
disrupt our business and could result in downtime or breaches of sensitive 
information such as personal data or company records. This continues to be 
a risk for IMCD, which requires a stable and agile ICT environment, especially 
when working remotely as in recent periods during this pandemic crisis.
IMCD enhances its ICT security and further develops its business processes as part of its ICT governance 
improvement programme. IMCD continuously invests in its IT infrastructure by timely implementation 
of new techniques, software and systems to protect its systems and data and to limit any down time of 
its systems.
IMCD focuses on improving its cybersecurity by raising awareness among employees and enhancing the 
security protocols for its systems. A wide range of new and existing security measures such as access 
and authorisation controls and back-up and recovery systems help IMCD to protect the quality and 
integrity of information in a continuously changing ICT landscape. These measures are monitored by 
the central ICT team on an ongoing basis.
Health / safety / 
environmental 
incidents
Marketing, sales and distribution of speciality chemicals, food and 
pharmaceutical ingredients entails exposure to health, safety and 
environmental risks which could potentially lead to reputational and financial  
damage. Examples of such exposures are:
• employees and logistic service providers who are not properly trained/
informed on handling of products
• products used for illegal purposes
• lack of quality management
• missing permits and notifications 
• product disposal not being properly controlled, leading to pollution and 
environmental damage
The majority of IMCD's subsidiaries have implemented certified  quality systems and make use of 
monitoring systems for recording and analysing any non-conformities in order to further optimise their 
business processes. IMCD has a Corporate HSEQR policy in place.
IMCD has outsourced the majority of its logistics operations to reputable third-party logistics service 
providers, who are carefully selected and continually monitored by the supply chain team to ensure 
quality standards and optimum performance.
Employees, customers and logistics service providers are issued with adequate safety instructions and 
operating procedures for handling chemical products. Critical product data is managed by a team of 
experienced specialists.
Yearly training programmes are established and implemented to ensure both employees and logistics 
service providers are aware of recent and future developments and changes in laws and regulations.
Climate change It is widely recognised that climate change poses significant  risks to natural, 
social and economic systems across the globe. The range of hazards is broad, 
from slow onset weather pattern changes to sudden extreme events. The 
consequent potential impacts affect  ecosystems and natural environments, 
and therefore might directly or indirectly cause serious technical, financial,  
geopolitical and other changes in society. Some of these risks might impact 
IMCD’s activities, for example disruptions to transportation infrastructures 
due to extreme weather events, or shortages of some feedstock due to 
agricultural losses.
Potential climate factors are considered in the selection process of logistics service providers, 
addressing accessibility and back-up procedures in the event of environmental incidents.
In 2023, IMCD finalised  its assessment of risks and opportunities against the TCFD to understand 
its business' resilience to the impacts of climate change. The assessment focused on both physical 
and transition risks up to 2050. As climate scenarios are inherently uncertain, the scenario analysis 
considered the full range of potential impacts associated with each item, identifying those items that 
could have a high impact and high uncertainty.

Compliance
RISK RISK DESCRIPTION RISK MEASURES
Non-compliance with laws 
and regulations
Being present in various countries across the globe, IMCD is 
exposed to local and international legal and compliance risks. As a 
matter of principle, IMCD complies with all applicable national and 
international laws and regulations (including legislation, standards 
and requirements in the field  of trade sanctions and export control, 
environment, human rights, health and safety, competition and tax).
IMCD has set up an internal competition compliance framework and trains its employees by means of 
a compliance programme to observe national and international antitrust laws. In this way, IMCD makes 
its employees aware of potential conflicts  with competition law and actively helps them to avoid any 
potential adverse consequences of competition law breaches.
IMCD neither engages in nor supports the use of forced labour, bonded or involuntary labour or 
child labour. IMCD therefore complies with the standards of the International Labour Organization 
and the minimum age requirements in all countries in which IMCD conducts business. IMCD's further 
commitment to respect human rights is embedded in its publicly available Group Human Right Policy.
Taxes are paid where the economic activity occurs. In cases when there is insufficient  local knowledge 
of tax issues, the company makes use of external advisors to ensure compliance with local 
tax requirements.
Anti-corruption and bribery Non-compliance with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws could 
lead to fines  and potential prosecution of employees, and could 
substantially harm the company’s reputation.
Specific  internal anti-corruption and anti-bribery policies are in place, offering  our employees clear 
examples of conduct that should be avoided. A continuous compliance training programme is in 
place to create and maintain awareness of ethical business practices and to ensure compliance with 
applicable trade restrictions, antitrust and anti-bribery laws, market abuse rules and other compliance 
regulations and more. IMCD uses an online learning (e-learning) platform and a standardised group 
compliance training curriculum as part of the IMCD compliance programme.

RISK RISK DESCRIPTION RISK MEASURES
Volatility of 
foreign currencies
IMCD is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings 
that are denominated in a currency other than the functional 
currencies of the company.
IMCD uses forward exchange contracts to hedge currency risks; most of these contracts have maturities 
of less than one year. Interest on borrowings is denominated in the currency of the borrowing. 
Generally, borrowings are denominated in currencies that match the cash flows  generated by the 
underlying operations, providing an economic hedge without derivatives being entered into. In respect 
of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the company's policy is to 
ensure that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot 
rates when necessary to address short-term imbalances.
Credit risk IMCD’s exposure to credit risk is influenced  mainly by the individual 
characteristics of each customer. However, IMCD also considers 
the demographics of the customer base, including the default 
risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, as 
these factors may impact the credit risk. There is no significant  
geographical concentration or concentration at individual customer 
level of credit risk.
IMCD has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analysed individually for 
creditworthiness before the company’s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are 
offered.  IMCD’s review includes the use of external ratings, when available, and in some cases bank 
references. Purchase limits are established for each customer, which represents the maximum open 
amount. These limits are reviewed periodically, at least once a year. New and existing customers 
who fail to meet the company’s benchmark creditworthiness may transact with IMCD only on a 
prepayment basis.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that IMCD will encounter difficulty  in meeting 
the obligations associated with its financial  liabilities that are settled 
by delivering cash or another financial  asset.
IMCD's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have 
sufficient  liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without 
incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to IMCD’s reputation. Typically IMCD ensures that it 
has sufficient  cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses for the next twelve months, 
including the servicing of financial  obligations.
Interest rate risk IMCD is exposed to interest rate risk with respect to its 
financial  assets and liabilities, either from fixed  rate or variable 
rate instruments.
IMCD has adopted a policy of ensuring that at least a large portion of its exposure to changes in interest 
rates on long-term loans is on a fixed-rate  basis, taking into account assets with exposure to changes 
in interest rates. When required, interest rate swap contracts are used for hedging variable into fixed  
interest rates.

1 General
Materiality Assessment
The materiality assessment was undertaken in 2021 by engaging key internal and external 
stakeholders and applying the impact materiality principle, which takes a forward-looking 
perspective. IMCD's approach to the impact materiality principle was to assess the 
identified  material topics against business impact and importance to stakeholders. Our 
material topics were determined through desk research on ESG reporting frameworks, 
ESG ratings, disclosure standards, trend reports, and a comparison with IMCD's peers 
and current initiatives. The list of topics was refined  through internal discussions on the 
topics risks and opportunities. Once the list of material topics was established, stakeholder 
relevance on the topics and business impacts was assessed.
During all activities, feedback was requested to validate the list of material topics and their 
definitions.  The relevance to stakeholders was assessed in interviews with a selection of 
IMCD’s senior managers and principal partners, in a workshop with internal stakeholders 
who gave by-proxy insights for IMCD’s stakeholders (customers, principal suppliers, IMCD 
staff,  and investors) and through additional desk research on a selection of customers, 
principal partners, investors, public organisations and peers.
The material topics’ impacts were assessed in a workshop during which the working group 
members discussed and rated the outside-in and inside-out impacts. This latter step was 
performed to comply with the concept of impact materiality in line with the GRI Standards. 
The material topics were mapped in IMCD’s Materiality matrix.
In line with GRI Standards, the material topics are reflections  of IMCD’s significant  
economic, environmental, and social impacts, and substantively influence  the assessments 
and decisions of stakeholders.
Stakeholder engagement
In close cooperation with the key stakeholders in its value chain, IMCD strives 
for operational excellence in all aspects of its business operations. Based on open 
relationships with its business partners, IMCD aims to create sustainable long-term value 
for its stakeholders. For IMCD, stakeholder engagement takes many forms and comprises 
multiple topics. In the table below we summarise our stakeholder clusters/groups, the 
most relevant topics and fora through which we engage with each group of stakeholders.

How our stakeholders were selected
For dialogue on the sustainability aspects of IMCD's strategy, stakeholders were identified  
through desk research and interviews with senior management. IMCD also ook feedback 
from customers, principals, and third-party logistic service providers as well as from 
sustainability rating agencies such as EcoVadis, auditors, certification  bodies, public 
authorities, and investors. This feedback helps us to further improve on the various 
sustainability topics.
As a distributor of a wide range of speciality chemicals and ingredients, we acknowledge 
that the products we distribute have impact throughout their life cycle. Therefore, 
IMCD encourages responsible and sustainable operations in its entire supply chain and 
cooperates closely with its supply chain partners, both upstream and downstream. IMCD's 
direct environmental footprint is limited given its asset-light business model.
Also through our own actions, we can contribute to making the chemicals and ingredients 
supply chains more sustainable and future-focused. We can select and influence  our third-

party logistics service providers, we engage with our customers regarding their needs and 
educate them and we feed our principals with information regarding the needs in the 
market, and together we co-innovate to meet the environmental and societal challenges 
we all face. We truly believe that the sustainability challenges our planet and society face 
are not something we can tackle alone.
In compliance with the new Dutch Corporate Governance Code, IMCD conducted a review 
of its stakeholder dialogue processes in 2023. The purpose of this review was to ensure 
that the company can effectively  communicating with its stakeholders. As part of this 
effort,  IMCD developed a Stakeholder Dialogue Policy that outlines formal procedures for 
addressing grievances and remediate potential impacts. It is available on IMCD's website.
Voluntary commitments to external sustainability initiatives
IMCD participates in various external sustainability initiatives, networks, and platforms. 
Some examples are given below. A more extensive list of IMCD's main memberships of 
industry and other associations can be found on IMCD's website.
Together for Sustainability (TfS)
Together for Sustainability is a joint sustainability initiative and global network of the 
chemical industry. Founded in 2011, and with world-leading chemical companies among 
its membership, it has grown into a global standard for ESG performance in chemical 
supply chains.
After joining TfS in 2022, IMCD now has access to a procurement-driven network of 
global companies working together to create global solutions and robust tools that tackle 
sustainability issues in the supply chain. All TfS members have full access to this global 
network of assessed and audited suppliers. TfS members benefit  from efficiencies  in 
sustainable procurement and towards their own sustainability goals. Suppliers benefit  
from exposure to a pool of chemicals buyers with an annual purchasing power of over 
EUR 300 billion.
IMCD contributes to TfS as an important link in the chemical supply chain between 
principal suppliers and customers. We bring knowledge of market trends and customer 
demands - especially the small and medium-sized enterprises segment - and we work 
towards sustainable logistics services by providing input to the Product Carbon Footprint 
(PCF) data from our transport and logistics processes.
EcoVadis
As participant in TfS, IMCD Group and several group companies undergo annual 
assessments by EcoVadis, a leading sustainability rating provider that promotes 
transparency and sustainability in global supply chains. IMCD is proud to have achieved 
group-level Gold recognition in 2022 for the second time, with an improved score from 
67 to 70. This scorecard was valid through year 2023. Early 2024, our Ecovadis Gold 
recognition was reinstated and our score improved from 70 to 74.
In addition, in 2023 our subsidiaries further improved their ESG performance and were 
also able to increase or maintain their individual EcoVadis scores. In 2023, the outstanding 
efforts  of IMCD Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain were awarded with 
a platinum rating, placing them among the top 1% performers assessed by EcoVadis in 
the chemical distribution industry. IMCD Benelux, Brazil, US, and UK were awarded with 
a gold level recognition. Finally, our offices  in South Africa and India achieved Bronze. 
Assessments of some other significant  IMCD companies are expected to further add to our 
honours list of sustainable offices. 
Sustainalytics' ESG Risk Rating
Sustainalytics, a Morningstar Company, is a leading independent ESG research, ratings 
and data firm  that supports investors around the world in developing and implementing 
responsible investment strategies. Its ESG Risk Ratings measure a company's exposure 
to industry-specific  material ESG risks and how well a company is managing those risks. 
In 2023, IMCD received an ESG Risk Rating of 13.7, indicating that IMCD is at low risk of 
experiencing material financial  impacts on ESG factors. This ranking places IMCD among 
the top of 205 international peer companies in trading and distribution.
Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil
IMCD is a proud member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), a non-profit  
organisation that unites stakeholders from seven sectors of the palm oil industry, aiming 
to develop and implement global standards for sustainable palm oil. In 2023, 44 IMCD 
entities were part of IMCD's group membership.
Responsible Care and Responsible Distribution
Most of IMCD’s operating companies take part through local associations in the 
Responsible Care or Responsible Distribution programmes of the International Council 
of Chemical Associations (ICCA). These operating companies have stated that they are 
committed to the ongoing development and observance of the guidelines laid down in the 
global programme covering eight guiding principles.

Integrated Report 2023
The commitment to these guidelines and policies is assessed by independent third-party 
experts in accordance with the relevant regional assessment systems. Independent 
experts also review and document the relevant operating company's environmental 
performance and safe handling of chemicals.
United Nations Global Compact
IMCD supports the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact, the largest 
corporate sustainability initiative in the area of human rights, labour, environment, and 
anti-corruption. These principles are embedded in IMCD's culture and values, and have 
been included in the Group's policies and procedures over the past years. As of February 
2022, IMCD is an official  signatory to the UN Global Compact. This report serves as our 
second Communication on Progress for 2023 and in addition we will report on the UNGC 
website via questionnaire supported by their digital platform.
Applying the precautionary principle
IMCD believes in actively responding to the threat of serious and irreversible damage 
to society and the environment. Even when issues are uncertain, the possibility of 
adverse effects  urges us to make discretionary decisions. When acting on its key areas 
of sustainability, IMCD applies and encourages its partners to apply the precautionary 
principle so as to protect society and the environment from exposure to harm.
Grievance mechanism and concerns communication
For all concerns, IMCD has implemented an Internal Alert Procedure, available on its 
website, that enables IMCD employees worldwide to report, without fear of retaliation, any 
irregularities or deviations in IMCD's operations, including deviations from IMCD's business 
principles as described in the Code of Conduct or other group policies. To support the 
use of the Internal Alert Procedure and in line with European legislation on whistleblower 
protection (Directive EU 2019/1937) IMCD maintains an (externally hosted) Ethics and 
Compliance Hotline. This hotline is also included in the ESG Standards for IMCD Business 
Partners and open to reports by third party stakeholders.
All complaints and critical concerns regarding HSEQR related topics are handled through 
the existing complaint and incident handling procedure. Claims raised internally or by third 
parties are reported to the Group Finance and Legal Department. Emergency situations 
can also be communicated to IMCD through a 24-hour emergency response provider or by 
calling a contact number on IMCD’s website.
All reported concerns, complaints and incidents are registered, investigated, followed up 
and closed. Reported non-compliance claims are registered using global systems and 
following global procedures. Local HSEQR Managers are responsible for assessing the 
compliance impact of non-conformities and determining the actions required.
Significant  complaints and incidents must be communicated to the relevant IMCD 
Product Manager, the local finance  Department, and the local Managing Director, as 
well as to the HSEQR Manager responsible for the region, and the Group Regulatory, 
Quality and Sustainability Director. The latter is responsible for assessing the concerns 
raised, communicating critical concerns to the Management Board, and managing the 
required actions.
In 2023, no critical concerns about the organisation's potential and actual negative impact 
on stakeholders were raised through the company's grievance mechanism and, hence, no 
concerns were reported to the highest governance body.

Management approach
The IMCD Management Board and Executive Committee are responsible for and 
committed to achieving the highest standards of talent attraction and retention, diversity, 
training, and labour practices. The Global Human Resources Director, who reports to the 
CEO, is responsible for developing and implementing people practices in dialogue with the 
Management Board and Executive Committee. IMCD has a network of Human Resources 
(HR) heads in big and medium-sized countries who implement HR practices and policies in 
line with the company strategy and global people plans.
The overall People related goals for IMCD are described in the People Value section of this 
report. This describes what we want to achieve.
But as important as the "what" is the "how" we want to achieve our People goals. We 
have used various formal policies and documents describing the behaviours we expect 
from our people and the boundaries they need to respect. Firstly, The IMCD Code of 
Conduct and IMCD Business Principles. Secondly, IMCD's Management Instructions and 
thirdly, IMCD's values. The IMCD Code of Conduct and IMCD Business Principles apply to 
all our staff  and describe commitments and standards of expected behaviours, working 
conditions, equal opportunities, and human and labour rights. For country Managing

Directors we have additional Management Instructions detailing specific  company norms, 
actions, expectations, and limits of decision-making. The IMCD values embedded in our 
company culture provide further guidelines about what type of behaviours and actions 
we expect from all employees. Not only toward customers and suppliers, but also toward 
co-workers. The values also serve as a good starting point to explain to employees in newly 
acquired businesses how things are done at IMCD and the type of behaviour we expect.
In the latest IMCD materiality matrix IMCD decided to focus their people management 
approach on (1) Talent attraction and retention, (2) Diversity, equity and inclusion, and (3) 
Labour practices, in this order of importance.
2.1 Talent attraction, retention and development
Employee Learning and Development
Training hours
IMCD records training delivered to all employees in one central Learning Management 
System (LMS), the ‘IMCD Digital campus’, powered by Cornerstone software. IMCD 
continued on the one hand with defensive online training such as Antitrust, Fraud 
Prevention, Anti corruption and various Cyber security trainings but on the other hand 
IMCD invested significant  time and effort  in commercial training to strengthen the 
commercial capabilities of sales, marketing and customer service staff.  In the latter 
category popular programs were our proprietary Value Based Selling and Commercial 
Excellence training offerings.  Compared to last year, we more than doubled our 
investment in training with the average employee spending 14 hours on personal training 
and development versus 5 in the year before.
In 2023 IMCD continued with the successful technical and product training designed and 
delivered by IMCD’s technical Business Group experts. The 73 laboratories organised 
hundreds of technical training courses, product seminars, and formulation meetings to 
deploy the technical and formulation expertise for the benefit  of customers, principals and 
to train IMCD’s staff.  Such Business Group-specific  training is one of the core elements of 
our business and underlines the expertise that is present in the company. Most of these 
trainings are conducted classroom style in 73 globally dispersed labs and technical centres; 
delivery and attendance are not yet recorded centrally. The goal is to achieve this by the 
end of 2024.

Feedback mechanisms to capture development needs
We have formal mechanisms in place to promote an open feedback culture consisting of 
(1) global town halls with all staff,  (2) town halls in countries, and (3) town hall meetings 
in Business Groups but also (4) in the form of the global engagement survey, covering 
all employees in al countries. In the fourth quarter of 2022 we conducted the last survey 
and had a participation rate of 85% with an overall engagement level of 72% (as in the 
favourable and very favourable answers combined on this dimensions). We specifically  
asked employees to score the company on statements such as “IMCD is a great company 
for me regarding my development” (73% favourable score) or “I have access to learning 
and development needed to do my job well” (76% favourable score).
Performance and/or development review practices
93% of all country operations have a local, specific  evaluation system in place covering 
the employees in a business, regardless of their gender or employee category, with 
a frequency of once per year or more. The exception to this are the newly acquired 
businesses that are in the process of being integrated with existing IMCD operations. 
Furthermore, 68% of all country operations have formal arrangements in place to develop 
employees through individual development plans or training programs. 23% of the 
countries have multiple performance evaluation systems in place for different  employee 
categories such as sales or customer service specialists. These reviews are the same for 
men and women; no distinction is made between genders. In the engagement survey, 84% 
of respondents stated that “we hold ourselves and our team members accountable for 
results”, highlighting the focus in the company on evaluating performance.
The employee base has grown but less than in previous years
The vast majority of IMCD's employees bring with them a deep knowledge of and 
experience in industrial speciality chemicals or life science ingredients, as in food, pharma 
and personal care. Most employees work in internal or external sales, marketing, and 
product management, or technical development and application research roles. The 
commercial staff  makes up, by far, the largest portion of IMCD's organisation. Our 
organisation is flat  with locally delegated decision-making.
Our workforce grew in 2023 by 9.5% to FTE's 4,736 by the end of 2023 (2022: 4,323 FTE's) 
due acquisitions and organic growth. We had 1,236 new starters and 802 leavers. Leavers 
include all employees that left the company, both voluntary and non-voluntary. Reasons 
such as retirement, jobs elsewhere, or due to a post-acquisition business integration are 
part of this.  We closed the year with EMEA still being the largest region with 2,099 FTE's 
(44% of total), followed by Asia-Pacific  with 1,330 FTE's (28%) and the Americas region

Education levels are high
Like in previous years the educational levels of our employees are high to very high. IMCD 
employs 1,179 (25% of total FTE's) individuals with a completed Masters degree or higher 
and another 2,154 (46%) with a Bachelor degree or equivalent. Educational levels are 
especially high for our female employees, we employed 613 women (FTE) with a Master 
degree or higher compared to 566 men (FTE). These high education levels are critical for 
sustained business success.

Employee turnover and retention
IMCD's employee turnover levels are monitored continuously. In 2023, total turnover, for 
all reasons, calculated as the leavers divided by the average FTE over 2023 was 18% 
worldwide compared to 15% in year 2022, mainly due to increases in our Asia-Pacific  
region where we acquired and integrated a record number of six companies.
Regional differences in overall employee turnover
Compared to 2022, the attrition rate rose most in Asia-Pacific,  the year over year 
differences  in the Americas and EMEA regions were small. The 2023 attrition rate increase 
in the Asia-Pacific  region (to 21.9%) was due to country specific  reorganisations following 
six new business acquisitions and integrations. The Americas region reported 18.3% 
turnover (versus 18.7% in 2022), a downward trend in a still challenging labour market 
in North America. In EMEA turnover was 14.3% compared to last years 13.2%. Our 
management approach is to monitor turnover, per region and function, and to keep it 
flat  or bring it down compared to the three-year average. The many business acquisitions 
can sometimes distort the picture due to post acquisition business integrations. We also 
cross-checked turnover metrics against insights and leading indicators from the global 
engagement survey in which a very high 86% of employees stated that they had an 
interesting job and 82% would recommend IMCD as a great place to work.

Management turnover is low
In the global management sub-top of 412 individuals, we had 11% leavers which was 
significantly  below IMCD’s overall attrition rate. We aim to keep the management turnover 
lower than the average company turnover.
Management approach and lessons learned regarding employee attrition
IMCD operates in more than 60 countries and labour markets are very different.  However, 
highly educated technical or professional workers are in high demand everywhere. IMCD 
has learned that especially in fast growing regions such as Asia and in regions with many 
newly acquired businesses employee retention is less stable and attrition can be higher 
than the company average.

Integrated Report 2023
To control the resignation risk of key staff,  IMCD has put several initiatives in place. Firstly, 
IMCD senior management constantly monitors attrition levels by region, country, function, 
gender, and management level. We understand post acquisition turnover and distinguish 
structural from incidental changes in turnover rates.
Part of the flight  risk reduction was realized in 2023 by remunerating key staff  in line with 
the market or slightly above. Merit increases were higher in 2023 due to increased inflation  
and employees were compensated accordingly.
Another key retention measure is that IMCD employs 98% of all global staff  on permanent 
contracts. Temporary employees are less secure and present a higher flight  risk. IMCD 
commits to and offers  fixed  employment contracts or arrangements to retain staff  on 
all levels.
Turnover can be influenced  by the male versus female mix. We specifically  monitor the 
turnover of female and male employees and concluded that turnover among women 
is slightly lower than among men. Women make up 54% of IMCD’s employee base, yet 
account for only 49% of the leavers.
Lastly, another lesson learnt is to strive for fast integrations of newly acquired businesses 
in order to reduce the uncertainty for employees. IMCD has appointed region specific  
integration managers who oversee these processes, time lines and integration success.
Contingent workers
This group of people is made of individuals who are not employed by IMCD and not on 
the IMCD payroll but individuals who provide a service and send an invoice such as IT 
implementation consultants. It remains a relatively modest group of 280 individuals who 
provided their services for specific  projects. The number of contingent workers is less than 
6% of our regular employee base.
Employer branding
We have started a project to tighten up IMCD's employer branding and employee value 
proposition (EVP) and have set the goal of launching the new IMCD employer value 
proposition in the second quarter of 2024. The objective is to ensure labour market 
communication is consistent all over the world, especially the online labour market 
communications on channels such as Linked-in. In the new campaign, real employees of 
IMCD will feature prominently.
“IMCD’s new 
employer branding is 
based on the creative 
concept of Element E 
– the combination 
of employee and 
entrepreneurship.”
Laurens Dalmijn
General Counsel

Integrated Report 2023
Impacts on the economy, environment and people
Talent attraction, retention and development are critical aspects of organizational success 
in our global dynamic and competitive landscape. The ability to attract and retain skilled 
individuals not only influences  a company's performance but also has broader implications 
for the economy, environment, and people involved. The following actual and potential 
positive and negative impacts were identified  for this material topic with reference to 
GRI 3-3.
Economic growth
By attracting top talent and investing in their development, IMCD contributes to economic 
growth by fostering innovation and productivity within the speciality chemicals and food 
ingredients distribution industry. A skilled and engaged workforce can lead to increased 
efficiency,  profitability,  and competitiveness, benefiting  not only the company but also the 
broader economy.
Job creation
As the company expands its operations and workforce, it creates job opportunities both 
directly within the company and indirectly through its supply chain and support services. 
This helps reduce unemployment rates and stimulates local economies, particularly in 
regions where the company has a significant  presence.
Environmental sustainability
IMCD can integrate sustainability practices into its operations. By training employees on 
environmentally friendly processes and products, the company can reduce its ecological 
footprint and promote sustainable practices throughout its value chain, contributing 
positively to environmental conservation efforts. 
Social responsibility
IMCD's commitment to talent development often extends to corporate social responsibility 
initiatives, such as community engagement programs, charitable partnerships, and 
diversity and inclusion efforts.  These activities can have a positive impact on local 
communities, fostering goodwill and enhancing the company's reputation as a responsible 
corporate citizen.
Workforce displacement
IMCD's adoption of technology or process improvements aimed at enhancing efficiency  
and productivity could lead, in some cases, to workforce displacement or job restructuring. 
While these changes may be necessary for the company's competitiveness, they could 
have negative implications for employees who are not able to adapt or transition to 
new roles.
Social equity
Despite diversity and inclusion efforts,  there may still be challenges related to social equity 
within IMCD's workforce, such as disparities in representation, pay equity, or access to 
opportunities for advancement. Addressing these issues requires ongoing commitment 
and investment in diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.

2.2 Diversity, Equity and inclusion
A well-balanced workforce, near parity
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion shows strong progression towards goals
We had several diversity goals and targets in 2023.
Firstly, to maintain a balanced male and female employee base. We have achieved that 
near parity goal with 54% women and 46% men in the business. Secondly, to ensure 
the top management layer, the board and Executive Committee all have diversity in 
nationality. The Supervisory Board has 40% women and 60% men and consist of five  
individuals with three different  nationalities (Dutch, American, Danish). At the end of 
2023, the Management Board consisted of four individuals of which 25% women and four 
different  nationalities (Dutch, Swiss/German, British). The Executive Committee -excluding 
the Management Board members who also participate in the Executive Committee- 
consists of three males with three distinct nationalities (French, German, British). Thirdly, 
our goal was to appoint a minimum of 40% women in all open sub-top management 
vacancies worldwide. We overachieved here with 48% of all senior appointments made 
by women in the last year. A final  goal was to appoint a minimum of 33% women in 
senior commercial/P&L roles and to continue the specific  development programme for 
up-and-coming commercial women to boost this internal talent pipeline. We appointed 
34% of women in these commercial roles and had 21 participants in the second IMCD 
Women in leadership programme therefore, goal completed.
These goals on diversity and inclusion were set by the Management Board and discussed 
and supported by the Supervisory Board. All members of the Management Board attended 
and presented multiple times in the Women in Leadership programme and so did two 
actively involved members of our Supervisory Board. Fair to say that the Diversity and 
Inclusion topic has full leadership support-in words and actions.
Lessons learned from IMCD's Diversity plans are that with a near parity employee base 
the company has strong momentum and filling  roles with women in the management sub 
top becomes easier as IMCD gets closer to parity. Finding women for senior commercial 
or P&L roles remains a challenge and, that is why we continued the specific  plans to 
strengthen this talent pipeline. Another lesson learned is that with IMCD's success with 
a gender based diversity plan, other employee groups ask for plans as well, so we are 
contemplating broadening IMCD's diversity plans. Despite the above lessons learned, IMCD 
has not observed any negative impact from its diversity plans, policies and actions, on the 
contrary it helps to strengthen IMCD's employer brand and reputation in the market place.

Total 2,536 2,200 4,736 2,290 2,033 4,323
diversity % 54% 46% 53% 47%
Women leadership
The share of women in our workforce went up slightly from 53% in 2022 to 54% by 
the end of 2023. Zooming in on women in management roles we observe that 44% of 
management sub top positions are taken by women (as in members of the various country 
management teams plus senior leaders in regional head offices).  IMCD employs 31% of 
women in commercial management roles (as in client or principal facing management 
roles with a responsibility for profit  or loss). The latter is important since this group is the 
feeder talent pool for senior leader and country managing director roles (directly reports 
to the countries managing director; the region headquarters in Asia_Pacific  and Americas 
(i.e. Singapore and Miami); the leader of IMCD Group in headquarters in Roterdam that 
directly report to the CEO, CFO and COO). With the arrival in Q4 of the incoming CEO 
the female representation in the IMCD N.V. Management Board (CEO/CFO and COO) also 
increased to 25% in 2023 and will increase to 33% starting January 2024 when the outgoing 
CEO has left the company.
Diversity in nationality
Our employee base includes more than 65 different  nationalities. The various national 
origins at the top of the house (Management Board/Supervisory Board/Executive 
Committee) are mentioned below.
In 2023 IMCD’s Management Board consisted of four members, two of whom are Dutch, 
one Swiss/German and one British. In 2023 the Management Board had an incoming and 
out going CEO overlapping for a quarter and will go back to a three person board in 
2024. The Supervisory Board has five  members of three nationalities (Danish, American, 
Dutch) and our Executive Committee, excluding the above mentioned Management Board 
members consists of three senior leaders, of three distinct nationalities (French, German 
and British). Overall, the employee base includes more than 65 different  nationalities 
spread across 62 country operations. In its Global HQ, IMCD employs 92 individuals with 
21 different  nationalities.

Integrated Report 2023
Management approach to Diversity
The IMCD Diversity strategy and management approach aims on the one hand to 
maintain the positive near equal gender balance for the company as a whole and on 
the other hand to accelerate the development of women in management roles and 
specifically  in commercial management positions. IMCD’s Management Board monitors 
female appointments in the management sub top teams; from a pool of 412 positions in 
2023 IMCD had a total of 82 openings and appointed 40 women (48%). The local country 
management teams, that form the management sub top together with the senior staff  in 
regional head offices,  are key talent feeders for the future executive talent pipeline. IMCD 
is pleased with the balance of appointments in these key roles, we are close to gender 
parity in this.
These above mentioned goals were set after an in-depth internal diversity analysis, which 
was discussed at Board level. The conclusion was that women were well represented 
in country management teams, especially in roles such as Marketing, HR, Legal and 
Finance, but less so in commercial and digital leadership roles. Therefore the successful 
IMCD Women in Leadership programme has been continued in 2023/24. This women-
only development programme aims to accelerate the training and development of 
women in the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific  region, and to better prepare them for 
future executive leadership roles. We are currently discussing internally additional talent 
programs to speed up the development of other groups of high potential employees, both 
men and women.
Diversity in age groups
The age profile  of IMCD staff  also underlines the fact that IMCD is an equal opportunities 
company for all ages. IMCD had 10 interns/students younger than 20, not employees. 
At the other end of the spectrum, IMCD employed 1,063 FTE's over 50 (22% of the total 
workforce at year-end 2023 – same as in 2022). The 781 FTE's in the below 30 age group 
remained stable with 16% of the workforce and the vast majority (2,892 FTE's or 61%) 
belonged to the 30 - 50 age group. No change there either.

The overall IMCD age distribution has remained nearly unchanged compared to 2022.
The process to report grievances such as discrimination
For many years now we have set up a widely communicated and maintained an Internal 
Alert Procedure and an Ethics and Compliance Hotline where employees can report 
grievances, anonymously, if they wish so. In 2023, we received five  grievances that were 
investigated and followed up with appropriate action including a separation. Reported 
cases were sexual harassment, complaints about specific  individuals or their leadership 
style and were always aimed at certain individuals. However, no discrimination cases 
were reported. We had no pending cases from previous years. For the definition  used 
for discrimination, please see note 5.1 to the Sustainability Statements.

Impacts on the economy, environment and people
At IMCD, embracing Diversity, Equity and Inclusion isn't just about being fair- it's about 
boosting our business, environment, and our stakeholders. Within this material topic, 
IMCD has the potential to bring positive changes such as fostering creativity and 
promoting social cohesion. However, they may also come with implementation challenges. 
The following actual and potential positive and negative impacts were identified  for this 
material topic with reference to GRI 3-3.
Workforce effectiveness and creativity
IMCD's commitment to diversity fosters a culture of effectiveness  and creativity within the 
workforce. By bringing together individuals with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and 
perspectives, IMCD can generate new ideas, problem-solving approaches, and product 
innovations that drive business growth and competitiveness.
Talent attraction and retention
A strong focus on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion enhances IMCD's attractiveness as an 
employer, helping to attract top talent from diverse talent pools. Furthermore, it fosters 
a sense of belonging and inclusion among employees, leading to higher job satisfaction, 
retention rates, and productivity. This ultimately contributes to a more skilled and engaged 
workforce, benefiting  both the company and the broader economy.
Market expansion and customer satisfaction
Diversity within IMCD's workforce enables the company to better understand and serve 
diverse customer segments. By reflecting  the diversity of its customer base, IMCD can 
develop products, services, and marketing strategies that resonate with a broader range of 
consumers, driving sales growth and market expansion.
Social cohesion and equality
IMCD's initiatives on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion promote social cohesion and equality 
by creating opportunities for underrepresented groups to perform in the workforce. 
By fostering a culture of respect, fairness, and inclusion, IMCD contributes to a more 
equitable society and helps break down barriers to economic and social advancement.
Implementation challenges
Implementing effective  Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives requires dedicated 
resources, leadership commitment, and cultural transformation within IMCD. Overcoming 
resistance, addressing systemic barriers, and promoting inclusivity at all levels of the 
organization can be challenging and require ongoing investment and effort. 
Perception risks
Inadequate or insincere Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts  can damage the company's 
reputation and brand image, particularly in an era where stakeholders increasingly 
expect companies to demonstrate a genuine commitment to diversity and inclusion. 
Negative publicity or allegations of discrimination could damage customer trust, 
investor confidence,  and employee engagement, impacting IMCD's bottom line and long-
term viability.
Unintended consequences
In some cases, well-intentioned Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives may have 
unintended consequences or reinforce existing inequalities. For example, diversity quotas 
or affirmative  action policies could lead to tokenism or backlash from certain groups.
2.3 Labour Practices and Human rights1
At IMCD, this topic covers the application of ethical labour practices and respect for 
human rights in our activities and business operations. When we engage with our business 
partners we ask them to adhere to and implement internationally-recognised human 
rights standards in their organisations.
Human Rights Policy
In 2023, IMCD worked to formalise its approach to human rights in its own organisation 
and its supply chain. To this extend, a global Human Rights policy was developed, and 
published on IMCD's website. It covers our management approach to human rights in our 
company. IMCD has had no negative employee or supplier complaints or grievances that 
could be classified  as a human rights case. The impact of the policy is a positive one for 
employees, suppliers and other business partners since it explains where IMCD stands. 
See the IMCD Group Human Rights Policy on the IMCD website.
Child & forced labour
IMCD has zero tolerance for forced labour and/or child labour. They have no place in 
IMCD. The chemical distribution industry is not high-risk in this respect, since most IMCD 
employees are highly-skilled workers active in office  environments, we don't manufacture. 
We monitor and track employees under the age of 20, mainly students, interns, and other 
young learners and double check with country leaders that these young workers have the 
right to work in their country or location and concluded that there were no cases of child 
and forced labour. A prohibition on child labour is included in the IMCD Group Human 
Rights Policy and the ESG Standards for IMCD Business Partners.
1 Revised Disclaimer: In accordance with GRI 401-2 (2016), this section focuses on Labour practices and Human Rights across all IMCD companies, deemed to be significant  operational locations. Note that the management of in-kind benefits,  including 
employee welfare programs, is handled on a country-specific  basis and therefore excluded from this report.

Collective bargaining and employee representation
IMCD respects the right of employees to organise and to join trade unions and 
representative bodies such as works councils and Health Safety & Environment 
Committees. This is embedded in IMCD's internal policies and instructions (including in 
the IMCD Group Human Rights Policy) and communicated as well to business partners 
through the ESG Standards for IMCD Business Partners.
All employees have the right of collective bargaining. When IMCD acquires companies, 
these sometimes come with unionised employees and IMCD respects this and nurtures 
existing relationships. Management measures annually how many workers are covered by 
collective labour agreements (CLA's). Management has no specific  goals or targets for the 
number of employees covered or not covered by a CLA since this is not a management 
decision but either mandatory by law or up to the individual, IMCD respects the right of all 
employees to organise themselves.
Employees covered or not-covered by CLA
2023 2022
Employees covered by CLA 1,342 1,1771
Employees not covered by CLA 3,394 3,146
Total 4,736 4,323
1 restatement: 56 FTE have been reclassed from not covered to covered by CLA due to missing data for IMCD Benelux 
NV in 2022
At year-end 2023 IMCD employed 1,342 employees who were covered by some 
kind of collective labour agreement i.e. 28% of the total workforce. The percentage 
increased slightly from 26% last year. Management also annually tracks formal employee 
representation. In 2023, IMCD had 3,284 employees (69% of the workforce) worldwide 
who were represented in formal joint management and employee Health & Safety 
Committees and 1,362 employees (29% of workforce) covered by formally elected 
employee representatives such as works councils, most of them in the EMEA region.
In 2023, IMCD encountered zero employee strikes. No industrial action against the 
company was reported. In 2023, we did not receive any complaints or grievances indicating 
that the freedom of association or collective bargaining was at risk in any of our countries, 
whether through management channels, our Internal Alert Procedure or the IMCD Ethics 
and Compliance Hotline.
Social dialogue and employee engagement remains strong
Dialogue between employees and management takes multiple forms. The IMCD 
management approach uses the following three communication channels: 1. Town 
hall meetings with all staff  2. Employee opinion surveys 3. Regular dialogue between 
management and employees. IMCD conducted two global town halls for all employees 
in 2023, one in March and one in November. The topics on the agenda included 
the introduction of the new CEO, digitalisation, the employee value proposition, the 
IMCD Pulse engagement survey, the financial  results, the sales excellence training, and 
sustainability. All staff  from all countries are invited to all town halls, which are live events 
with presenters from senior management such as the CEO, CFO, COO and IMCD's global 
HR director who take live questions. Remaining questions are answered offline. 
End of 2022 we conducted a global engagement survey, the IMCD Pulse Survey, and in 
2023 all countries have been very active in discussing the feedback to all employees and 
in determining country specific  action plans. We saw a high participation rate of 85% 
underlining the willingness of employees to share their opinions and in the following 
action planning and feedback meetings the participation was again very high. Survey 
outcomes were positive: 72% of all participants were favourable to very favourable about 
their overall engagement levels, 21% were neutral and only 7% unfavourable. All global 
results were shared with all employees in local country specific  town-halls and global 
communications on OneIMCD, the company's intranet. The three themes that came out 
on top were: 1. Values –79% favourable; 2. Management –77% favourable; 3. Alignment & 
Involvement –77% favourable.
A global three-point action plan was developed and shared with the Management Board 
and IMCD's Supervisory Board. On top of this country-wide plan all country management 
teams have given their survey result feedback and have started a dialogue to determine 
geography specific  action plans which are now in place. 
Lastly, due to our flat  organisational structure and the relatively modest size of our 
business (in terms of FTE's per country) our country managing directors and their HR 
teams are in daily contact with their colleagues and co-workers. Changes of department, 
positions or in  job contents can be discussed in an early stage to make sure employees 
who are affected  can engage in discussions. With regard to management of career 
endings, transition assistance programmes are set up in a case-by-case basis or when 
needed under local circumstances. If so, these programmes are tailored to local needs and 
aligned with local laws and regulations.

Integrated Report 2023
Flexible and remote work remain popular
Most of our countries have flexible  working, remote working policies or instructions in 
place. A consequence of the Covid-19 period. It is also a recurring theme in discussions 
with job applicants who often expect some kind of flexibility  in office  presence although 
the differences  between countries can be striking. In the US for instance this is an 
important topic and in some of our Asian countries less so. The contents of such flexible  
and remote work plans differ  per function and geography, underlining the freedom to act 
-one of our values- of local management. 
Special leave; parental, compassionate possibilities
In all our regions where we have operations, IMCD offers  additional leave to employees 
for specific  purposes such as maternity, paternity, studies, and compassionate leave. In 
general, both men and women are eligible for these leave categories. The most important 
special leave is parental leave. In 2023, 749 employees were entitled to parental leave, of 
which 355 women and 394 men. In total 192 indeed made use of the opportunity (26% 
take up rate). The take up rate is higher from women (34%) than from men (18%). Already 
134 have returned to work (70% voluntary return rate).

Total 121 71 192 118 52 170
Permanent and full-time contracts dominate
The overwhelming majority of IMCD’s employment contracts are permanent: 4,646 or 
98% of the year-end workforce. Only 90 (<2%) of the employees were on a temporary 
contract. IMCD believes that offering  regular, indefinite  contracts or job offers  provides 
employees with more security and a decent living and this is what employees value 
most. It is also a distinguishing feature in competitive labour markets. There is very little 
difference  between men and women in this respect. Only 29 of the 2,171 (1%) men are on 
a temporary contract and 61 of the 2,475 women (2%). A comparable pattern applies to 
full-time versus part time staff.  IMCD employed 4,594 or 97% full-timers (same percentage 
as the year before) and 142 or 3% part-time employees (measured in FTE). The latter 
group has requested flexibility  in their work patterns to fit  their work-life balance or family 
needs. IMCD offers  benefits  for full-timers, part-timers, and temporary workers, some 
benefits  require a waiting or vesting period. One of the most important benefits  is health/
medical care. No less than 94% of our countries offer  this to their employees, either via 
country specific  health care systems or via private care. Employees who work part-time 
have generally requested flexible  arrangements themselves.

Responsible restructuring remains an exception
Due to our flat  organisational structure and the relatively modest size of our businesses 
(in terms of FTE's per country) our country managing directors and their teams are in 
daily contact with their colleagues and co-workers. Changes in department, positions or 
job contents can be discussed at an early stage. IMCD informs employees of upcoming 
changes in the business/organization at an early stage and in detail, and we give people 
advance notice that complies with the minimum period of notice required locally and/or 
international level. Given our business model of delegated decision-making by country 
Managing Directors, we defer to their judgement of the local situation and provide 
advance notice and transition payments over and above the local legal requirements 
and/or better than packages resulting from collective bargaining agreements. In 2023, 
IMCD neither carried out any large-scale redundancies nor implemented workforce 
reductions/ restructuring/job cuts of more than 5% of the global employee base. 
Living wage
IMCD is committed to ensuring that all workers are paid a ‘living wage’ (i.e. the minimum 
remuneration to support basic needs) in accordance with applicable local laws. Indeed, 
a living wage is strongly supported by the 98% of employees on permanent contracts 
referred to above. The average salary & wages IMCD paid per employee in 2023 was 
EUR 63,400 per employee (EUR 68,800 in 2022), down 8% year-on-year. This excludes

social security, taxes, benefits,  and pensions. The year-on-year decrease was mainly due to 
business acquisitions in countries with lower salary levels and faster growth in APAC.
A cap on working hours
We believe that work should be organized efficiently  and should be doable in normal work 
week and we abide to all local labour laws in this respect. When there is an absence 
of applicable laws or collectively bargained labour agreements, working hours including 
overtime may not exceed 60 hours per week, and a minimum of one rest day per week is 
provided in all our countries.
Regular Board discussions on people topics
People, culture, talent, management appointments, diversity & inclusion, compensation, 
succession, OHS, and other labour matters are discussed by the Global HR Director and/or 
the Executive Committee members on a frequent basis with the IMCD Management Board 
but also with the Supervisory Board throughout the year. These discussions may relate to 
specific  individuals or to important people or social themes for the company. The board 
involvement on these topics is high.
Impacts on the economy, environment and people
At IMCD, our commitment to responsible labour practices and human rights is 
fundamental to our operations. This entails examining our positive and negative change 
both inside IMCD and externally, to the society and economy. The following actual 
and potential positive and negative impacts were identified  for this material topic with 
reference to GRI 3-3.
Fair employment practices
IMCD's adherence to fair labour practices, including competitive wages, benefits,  and 
opportunities for development, contributes to economic stability and prosperity. By 
treating employees ethically and providing a supportive work environment, IMCD fosters 
loyalty, productivity, and long-term commitment among its workforce.
Respect for human rights
IMCD's commitment to upholding human rights standards, both within our own 
operations and throughout our supply chain, helps protect the dignity and well-being of 
workers. By ensuring fair treatment, non-discrimination, and freedom from exploitation, 
IMCD promotes social justice and contributes to a more equitable society.
Employee empowerment
IMCD's emphasis on freedom to act enables workers to voice their concerns, advocate 
for their rights, and participate in decision-making processes. This fosters a culture of 
inclusivity, trust, and mutual respect, enhancing job satisfaction, morale, and overall well-
being among IMCD's workforce.
Worker safety risks
In the chemicals distribution industry, there may be inherent risks to worker safety 
and health. Despite implementing safety protocols and training programs, accidents and 
injuries can still occur, posing risks to employee well-being and potentially leading to 
reputational damage and legal liabilities for IMCD.
2.4 OHS & Well-being
The health and safety of our employees is of the utmost priority to us as they constitute 
the foundation of our business. As a result, we apply a people-centric management style, 
which is also reflected  in how we approach occupational health, safety and well-being. 
Our goal is to reduce occupational risks for our employees by providing safe surroundings 
and tools, offering  health and safety training and clear instructions on how to handle our 
products safely.
Recordable injuries
In 2023 we had 11 reported cases of employee injuries, the causes varied from slips, 
trips and falls to incidents in warehouses, commuting incidents and injuries due to sports 
activities in free time. Most injuries were reported in the Americas region (8 cases). None 
of the group companies reported any fatalities or injuries that prevented employees from 
working for more than six months in 2023.
Zero work-related injuries and illnesses
Zero work-related injures and illness is our aspirational target at all times. All our 
employees, contractors or parties present at our premises, whether full or part-time, 
should be safe and healthy and be able to lead a balanced life.
An occupational health and safety management policy (part of the IMCD HSEQR Policy) 
has been implemented across all companies in the Group in addition to adhering to local 
laws and regulations. It applies to all our employees and activities, with a focus on those 
that take place in labs, our own warehouses, and if we have them -operations-, as these 
by their nature involve a higher risk exposure than office  sites. As part of our strategy, 
IMCD runs regional health and safety management systems that outline our dedication

to offering  a secure workplace and guaranteeing that all our visitors and employees, 
wherever they may be, can go home safely each day.
The Global HSEQR & Sustainability Director developed and is responsible for the 
occupational health and safety management system, which is continually reviewed by him. 
Based on input from internal audit and recent incidents the policy is reviewed on a regular 
basis with new lessons learnt e.g. after a warehouse incident in Brazil additional employee 
awareness training was rolled out. Regional HSEQR Directors provide local support for the 
creation of local HSEQR plans. Our local HSEQR managers monitor the implementation 
of and adherence to the policy. We are dedicated to achieving our health and safety 
objectives by prioritising safe work practices in all processes and operating procedures, 
by proactively identifying and managing exposure to risk, and by making sure that our 
business operations adhere to all applicable laws and regulations in the regions in which 
we operate.
Employee training on occupational health and safety is carried out by our local HSEQR 
managers. Each employee receives regular training in these topics, which emphasises the 
use of safety data sheets when handling hazardous products as well as evacuation, first  
aid, and emergency instructions. There is a certified  first  responder and, as needed, a fire  
fighter  at every warehouse or site. Every incident at one of our locations that involves work 
is investigated by a qualified  individual or, if necessary, a committee.
Recordable injuries per region

EMEA 3 5
Americas 8 3
Asia-Pacific 0 6
Total 11 14
In this process, the hazards are identified,  the risks are evaluated, and the necessary 
improvements to the health and safety management system are decided. Employees are 
required to report hazards or circumstances at work that they believe could result in 
an injury or illness and to immediately remove themselves from the situation. For all 
our third-party logistics activities, we have established strict operating procedures. We 
track performance and non-conformances via our company wide NCR management. We

conduct annual audits of both internal and external facilities to check for adherence to 
health and safety policies in addition to our business reviews.
Based on 200,000 hours of labour, the rate of recordable work-related injuries was 
reduced from 0.31 in 2022 to 0.22 in 2023; the rate of high consequence work-related 
injuries remained at 0.00 in 2023 (0.00 in 2022), again based on 200,000 hours worked.
Within the reporting year of 2023, zero incidents of non-compliance concerning either the 
health and safety of our products and services nor product and service information and 
labelling, have been recorded neither in form of warnings fines  or penalties.
We held numerous trainings and briefings  on health and safety protocols and/or standard 
operating procedures, covering more than 75% of all employees. We followed up on 
accidents with the introduction of first-aid  classes, supplemented annual physicals with 
ergonomic evaluations of the workspaces and equipment, treated slippery surfaces, and 
assessed the prevention tools available on risky premises. We offer  all our workers the 
legally obligatory medical insurance plans and, where necessary, medical examinations to 
further ensure their overall health.
Impacts on the economy, environment and people
Economic productivity
IMCD's commitments to occupational health and safety contribute to economic 
productivity by reducing workplace accidents and injuries. A safe and healthy workforce 
is more productive and efficient,  leading to reduced absenteeism, lower healthcare costs, 
and higher employee morale and engagement.
Cost savings
By implementing robust occupational health and safety measures, the company can 
minimise the financial  burden associated with workplace incidents, such as medical 
expenses, workers' compensation claims, and regulatory fines.  This helps protect the 
company's bottom line and preserves resources for investment in business growth 
and innovation.
Environmental protection
Many occupational health and safety practices also have positive environmental impacts. 
For example, measures to reduce hazardous material exposure or prevent spills and 
leaks can help minimise environmental pollution and protect ecosystems. By prioritising 
environmental stewardship alongside worker safety, IMCD contributes to responsible 
resource management.
Employee wellbeing
IMCD's focus on employee well-being extends beyond physical safety to encompass 
mental health and overall wellness. Providing resources and support for stress 
management, work-life balance, and personal development enhances employee 
satisfaction and retention, fostering a positive organizational culture and reinforcing the 
company's reputation as an employer of choice.
Operational costs
While investing in occupational health and safety is essential for long-term sustainability, 
it can also entail significant  upfront costs for implementing safety protocols, training 
programs, and equipment upgrades.
Regulatory compliance
Non-compliance with occupational health and safety regulations can result in legal 
penalties, reputational damage, and operational disruptions for IMCD.
Worker resistance
In some cases, particularly in our operational sites, workers may resist certain OH&S 
measures or perceive them as overly restrictive or intrusive. This resistance can undermine 
the effectiveness  of safety initiatives and create tension between management and 
employees. Effective  communication, training, and employee engagement strategies are 
essential for overcoming resistance and fostering a culture of safety within IMCD.

Integrated Report 2023
3 Environment
3.1 Supply chain decarbonisation
3.1.1 Energy and emissions management: Scope 1, 2 and 3
Management approach to supply chain decarbonisation
Since 2019 (baseline year), IMCD tracked and reported emissions, both generated by 
own operation, as well as related to the third-party transportation of products purchased 
and sold.
Given our asset-light company model and minimal internal activities, our direct 
environmental impact is restricted, but we are aware that Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 
are produced by the energy used in our facilities, transportation, and operational 
procedures. It is imperative that we reduce these emissions in order to be an example 
for our downstream and upstream business partners.
The effects  that IMCD's operations have on the environment are well recognised 
and acknowledged by the management of the company. In IMCD’s business model, 
warehouse operations and transport are outsourced to a high degree. Our supply chain 
decarbonisation activities are centred on our third-party logistic service providers. The 
Scope 3 emissions we disclose are calculated based on their carbon footprint. We work 
together with our logistics service providers to reduce carbon emissions through efficient  
routing, volume-mileage optimisation, and the introduction of sustainable transportation 
modes. Supply Chain Decarbonisation is a key area for acceleration.
During 2023, we continued to work on enhancing the quality of our data and expanded 
the scope of our reporting. We improved on data accuracy and further optimised our 
CO2 dashboard to provide real-time visibility into the carbon footprints of our third-party 
logistics partners. Our sales and support teams can utilise this information to highlight 
efficiency  gains to customers and suppliers. The results will be used to fine-tune  the 
management programme. We also reinforced our third-party screening through the 
collaboration with EcoVadis and TfS. By reporting on our Scope 3 GHG emissions, we 
provide openness and transparency on operations from assets not owned or controlled by 
IMCD, but have an impact on our value chain.
The Supply Chain Decarbonisation Programme is built on two pillars: optimising our 
transport and order management, and collaborating with third-party logistics service 
providers to drive further improvements. IMCD's corporate supply chain team collaborates 
closely with local supply chain managers to ensure the most effective  routing, the highest 
volume-mileage ratio, and the adoption of more environmental friendly transportation 
modes whenever available.
This requires engagement with our main suppliers; we assist them in optimising 
their logistics setup, with the goal to generate more cost-effective  models and faster 
market access, while lowering carbon impact. Furthermore, where possible, we choose 
suppliers based on their ESG performance. When this is not possible, we engage, raise 
awareness, educate, and collaborate. Our engagement with our third-party logistics 
service providers starts with a commitment to our ESG Standards for Business Partners, 
followed by self-evaluation, EcoVadis assessment, audits, and collaborative emission-
reduction efforts.  A global supply chain management policy is in place and the Global 
Supply Chain Management, HSEQR, and Sustainability Director oversees the supply 
chain decarbonisation activities. Local supply chain managers are those responsible of 
implementing and carrying out the programme in each country.
Methodology
Hereby we present estimations, extrapolations and assumptions for all reported 
indicators, in cases when primary data was not available, as well as comments on 
the methodology used for calculations. Indicators not described in this section were 
reported based on the primary data collected by IMCD. Estimations, extrapolations 
and assumptions necessary for reporting the indicators considered in this section are 
connected with:
• data gaps in primary data reported from the sites (local/regional managers)
• impossibility of performing direct accounting (e.g. direct accounting of volumes of 
emitted GHG)
Company-specific  data used in the calculations is either factual or based on estimations:
1. Factual: data reported by the site with a proof document
2. Estimated: data estimated by the sites not fully covered by complete 
proof documentation, following the IMCD Sustainability Data Collection & ESG 
Reporting Manual
IMCD distinguishes the following categories of GHG emissions, following the GHG Protocol:
Scope 1 emissions are caused by using direct energy carriers in our offices,  in production 
locations, for business trips, and for our in-house transport, warehouse and distribution 
activities. Marginal share is associated with cooling agents in the air conditioning of our 
working spaces. (Material topic: "Eco-Efficient  operations")

Scope 2 emissions are the result of using provided energy (mainly electricity) in our offices,  
in production locations and to a certain extent, in our own warehouse activities. (Material 
topic: "Eco-Efficient  operations")
Scope 3 emissions we report represent the emissions originated in transport activities 
of our contracted third-party logistics service providers, mainly in the combustion of 
fuel. (Material topic: "Supply chain decarbonisation") Emissions originated from outsourced 
warehousing and storage activities are not included, as no reliable data is available.
Please note, IMCD understands that Scope 1 & 2 falls under material topic "Eco-Efficient  
operations", however, since management set 1 target for all types of emissions (Scope 
1, 2 and 3), emissions related to Scope 1 and 2 are covered in Note 3.1 "Supply chain 
decarbonisation" to the Sustainability Statements.
Reductions resulting from reduced production or outsourcing are excluded from IMCD's 
GHG emissions calculations. No carbon offsets  took place on behalf of IMCD during 2023, 
and therefore these were not considered as a category in our GHG emissions calculations.
Energy consumption within the organisation and direct emissions (Scope 1)
Energy consumption within the organisation and emissions associated with it arise 
from two main source activities: energy use in facilities (space heating and electricity 
generation, i.e. stationary combustion), and own transport (mobile combustion). Stationary 
combustion energy consumption data was collected from the sites for 2019-2023 
for the volume or mass of the fuels consumed. Some assumptions and estimations 
were performed to fill  the data gaps and derive direct emissions associated with 
stationary consumption.
We have used the following estimations:
• Conversion between volumes/massed of fuels and consumed energy was implemented 
based on the energy density of the respective fuels, sourced from the materials of 
University of California Berkeley
• GHG emissions associated with the stationary combustion were calculated based on 
the emission factors extracted from the Ecoinvent 3.6 database balanced using the IPCC 
(2013) GWP 100a method (global warming potential over 100 years). In order to include 
direct emissions only, the Ecoinvent datasets were modified  by removing upstream 
processes from consideration.
• One of the reporting locations used compressed natural gas (CNG) for transportation in 
one vehicle. The reported amount was combined for reporting with the values of LPG 
use as a conservative assumption. This resulted in a slight overestimation of emissions 
(assessed on the level of 0.01%).
With regard to own transport, two lines of assessments were used depending on the 
available data:
1. For the sites that reported fuel used, emissions from transport were estimated 
based on the reported volumes, standard conversion rates, and emission factors 
established for different  transport modes means when relevant. For locations that 
have different  modes of transport, the estimated fuel use was allocated between the 
reported vehicles according to the use specified  by the reporting locations, or when not 
available - calculated as assumed for other sites for each of the modes of transport. 
Emissions were calculated based on the emission factors extracted from the Ecoinvent 
3.6 database.
2. Estimations reported by the sites based on the total number of vehicles by type and 
average distance driven or hours operated (relevant for 2019-2021). The following 
estimations have been made for these cases:
• For passenger cars, fuel consumption is estimated based on the reported number 
of vehicles and type of fuel used (primary data), and the average distance driven 
(estimation or primary data). Fuel use was calculated based on the average passenger 
car (EURO 4) from the Ecoinvent 3.6 database, modified  according to the specified  fuel 
used (petrol, diesel, LPG or natural gas), or, when not available, in a respective mix 
of petrol, diesel and natural gas. For Scope 1 emissions calculations, the upstream 
processes were excluded. The same dataset was used to extract the GHG emissions 
factor balanced using the IPCC (2013) GWP 100a method. For hybrid passenger cars, 
fuel is used as the predominant consumed energy.
• For diesel, petrol or LPG-fuelled in-house transport vehicles (warehouse transport), 
energy use is estimated based on the reported number of vehicles (primary data), 
average hours of operation per day (estimation) and fuel use per hour of operation 
(based on Ecoinvent 3.6 data set for diesel machine operation, 18.64-74.57 kW in high 
load – corresponding to average warehouse diesel loader). The same data set was used 
to extract the GHG emissions factor of combustion of a kg of diesel used in the activity 
balanced using the IPCC (2013) GWP 100a method.
• For petrol and LPG fuelled warehouse transport, energy consumption per year was 
estimated to be equal to that of diesel (in MJ/hour), and the associated emissions per 
kg of fuel were calculated based on the emissions factor for fuel consumption of a 
passenger car (Scope 1 only, excluding upstream processes).
• For transport by trucks, energy consumption is estimated based on the reported 
number of trucks (primary data), driven distance per year (estimation), and average

load of a truck by type (small or articulated lorry). Where primary data is available, 
a distinction is made between trucks fuelled by petrol or diesel. When not available, 
all transport was assumed to be performed by diesel trucks, Energy consumption 
was extracted from an Ecoinvent 3.6 data set in respect to tkm transport services 
(Scope 1 only, excluding upstream processes). The same dataset was used to extract 
GHG emissions factors per tkm of transport (Scope 1 only). For petrol fuelled trucks, 
the energy consumption per year was estimated to be equal to that of diesel (in 
MJ/tkm), and the associated emissions per kg of fuel were calculated based on the 
emissions factor for fuel consumption of a passenger car (Scope 1 only, excluding 
upstream processes).
• Conversion between volumes/masses of fuels and consumed energy was implemented 
based on the heating value of the respective fuels. Additionally to energy consumption 
associated GHG emissions, the reporting includes fugitive emissions associated with 
space cooling (air conditioning) in facilities. These Scope 1 fugitive emissions were 
estimated based on the reported floor  area with air conditioning, with assumed split-
air AC capacity 60m2 per 1.7kg of charge (R410A as a conservative assumption), 
and leakage rate according to the IPCCC guidance 2006 (3%). Fugitive emissions 
of refrigerant from small refrigeration units in own warehouses were assessed to 
be negligible.
Estimated GHG gases include CO2 , CH4 , N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6 , NF3 , and others. The 
financial  control approach was consistently applied in reporting. Following the approach, 
fuels consumption for space heating was included into the scope for all own and (IFRS16) 
leased facilities. 2019 is used as base year in the target setting towards 2024.
Energy consumption inside the organisation: energy indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2)
Relevant energy consumption inside the organisation and the associated emissions relate 
to energy usage in facilities (space heating, space cooling and electricity usage), and own 
transport (passenger cars and warehouse). Data on consumption of supplied heating and 
cooling is provided in GJ.
• Emissions associated with supplied heat consumption were estimated flat  for all 
locations. Emission factors are retrieved from https:// www.co2emissiefactoren.nl/. The 
choice for the Dutch emission factor was made due to the location of the company's 
headquarters. Following the precautionary principle, the conservative assumption of 
CHP district heating was assumed. The emission factor is consistent with the IPCC 
(2013) GWP 100a method.
• Emissions associated with supplied cooling were calculated based on the data for 
consumed energy and the respective emission factors. Where possible, emission 
factors were calculated with a primary databased modelling of cooling production. 
When this was not possible, the flat  emissions factor based on the Ecoinvent 3.6 
data set for the global market for cooling energy was used. The emission factors are 
consistent with the IPCC (2013) GWP 100a method. Data on electricity consumption was 
obtained from the sites in MWh.
• Emissions associated with electricity consumption were estimated using the location-
based approach. Due to lack of market-specific  emission factors, the gross market-
based energy indirect GHG emissions are reported on the location-based level. 
Emissions factors were extracted from the Ecoinvent 3.6 datasets for the respective 
regional electricity mixes, balanced using the IPCC (2013) GWP 100a method. Emission 
factors include a minor share of the upstream emissions (i.e. emissions occurring in the 
life cycle of electricity production prior to the electricity generation per se), and thus 
additionally account for Scope 3 (Category 3) emissions.
• Electricity consumption and Scope 2 emissions associated with transport refer to use of 
electricity for electric passenger cars, and electric loaders at own warehouses.
• Electricity consumption for transport is estimated based on the number of in-house 
electric vehicles (primary data), estimated hours of work per year and electricity use 
per hour of operation assuming a 15% loading time use (based on specifications  of 
a commonly used articulated loader1 ). When available, primary data on the number 
of electric passenger cars is used, assuming per-km driven electricity consumption 
according to the respective Ecoinvent 3.6 dataset for electric passenger car. When not 
available (years 2019-2020), the share of passenger car transport using electric cars is 
calculated based on the estimated shares in the Ecoinvent 3.6 datasets, in Europe and 
the rest of the world separately. The values for electricity consumption for transport are 
only indicative and used to estimate distribution of electricity usage between transport 
and facilities.
• Electricity usage for facilities and associated emissions are calculated as the difference  
between the total electricity usage and electricity usage for transport.
Estimated GHG gases include CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3, and others. GHG trades 
are excluded from the calculation of gross energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions. The 
financial  control consolidation approach was consistently applied in reporting. Following 
the approach, energy consumption was included in the scope for all own and leased 
facilities of the companies of the Group according to IFRS 16. 2019 is used as base year in 
the target setting towards 2024.
To avoid double counting of fuel consumption, IMCD considers self-generated electricity 
consumption only under fuel consumption. In 2023, IMCD did not generate energy for self-
consumption.

Other indirect GHG emissions (Scope 3)
Scope 3 reporting of emissions is based on the combination of detailed transactional 
data about the transportation assignments and expert assumptions of our group supply 
chain management team. Other Scope 3 categories were excluded as they were negligible, 
irrelevant, or in case reliable data is not available.
Scope 3 transport emissions volume was modelled based on the available data for delivery 
distance, mass and general mode of transport. Logistics database extracts were used, 
containing the primary data on the net mass of a product delivered, country and postal 
code of starting point and country and postal code of the destination point, as well as 
mode of transportation. For the emissions calculations, the following assumptions and 
estimations were made:
• Mass of packaging for all of the products was estimated as 3% of the net mass of 
the delivered products, i.e. the pessimistic estimate provided by the Supply Chain 
Department and harmonised with the active logistics software.
• Of the products transported, 2% of the products (w/w) is estimated to be transported 
using refrigerated transport (based on an assumption of the group supply chain 
management team).
• When mode of transportation is not specified,  an assumption is made. All intra-
continental transactions are assumed to be performed by road transport (articulated 
lorry, based on the estimation provided by the Logistics Department). That also applies 
to all transport in Europe with the island countries (Ireland, UK, Faeroe Islands, Malta 
and Cyprus). Inter-continental transport includes road and air/sea transport. It is 
assumed that the following transport is performed 100% by road between: Europe and 
North Africa; Europe and Central Asia; Asia and Central Asia; Middle East and Central 
Asia; North Africa and Central Asia. Other intercontinental transport is assumed to be 
performed by sea (transoceanic ship).
• Rail transportation was calculated with the road transportation, to keep the consistency 
with the calculation methodologies of previous years, when rail transportation was 
utilised but not specified. 
• Distances for the road transport are calculated as distance by roads (including roads 
with tolls) from geolocation of starting point to geolocation of destination, using AWS 
Location Services. The process involves checking for the combination of postal code, 
city, country, and account name. If no match is found, the system checks for the 
combination of postal code, city, and country. If there is still no match, the system 
returns a default location of (0,0). Additionally, if a 3-letter country code is available, it is 
added as a region filter  to enhance precision. The few shipments without distance were 
added to “mass lost”.
• For air shipments, we use the standardised distance formulation to return the direct 
line distance between the ship from and ship to geo locations.
• Sea freight distance is calculated as a straight-line distance, similar to air freight 
distances, but adjusted on the coefficient  of 2.1516. The coefficient  is extracted 
based on the analysis of the relation between straight-line distance in AWS Location 
Services and marine navigation distance for a sample of locations that contained short-, 
medium-, and long distance freight. The differences  are assumed to be coming from the 
water routes available for navigation, manoeuvring, and navigation dispatching.
• Transport services are calculated by multiplying the mass of the delivered product with 
packaging by the transport distance. The sum of transportation services volumes in tkm 
is adjusted, by adding a percentage equal to the percentage of “mass lost”, i.e. mass of 
products for which no distance calculation was possible. The values extrapolated in this 
manner contribute less than 3% of the total emissions for the indicators for 2023.
• For each of the types of freight, two generic modes of transport were identified:  with 
refrigeration and without refrigeration. Respective datasets are chosen from Ecoinvent 
3.6 and approved as an approximation by the Supply Chain Department. The datasets 
are used to extract the GHG emissions factors per tkm of transport services, calculated 
using the IPCC (2013) GWP 100a method.
In view of gradual expansion of the geographical scope of reporting of Scope 3, the 
following geographical scopes are presented in the report:
• for 2019: EMEA without Middle East and Africa (South Africa included); Malaysia, 
Indonesia, India; the USA without Puerto Rico, and transactions of acquired assets of 
US Food and ET Horn.
• for 2020: scope of 2019 with the addition of Bahrain, Samoa, Hong Kong, Taiwan, 
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand; added US assets of Puerto Rico, US Food and 
E.T. Horn.
• for 2021: scope of 2020 with the addition of Canada, Mexico, Kenya, Latvia, Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, Burundi and Uganda.
• for 2022: scope of 2021 with the addition of Morocco, Japan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Israel, 
and China (two companies of the Group).
• For 2023: scope of 2022 with the addition of Hungary, Bulgaria, an additional company 
in Mexico, Peru, Colombia, Australia, New Zealand, an additional company in India, 
China (7 entities) and Korea.
Specific  notes for the calculations of Scope 3 emissions:
• For the companies acquired during each reporting cycle, the FTE as at the end of 
the year is used, while transport transactions and EBITDA are only included as from

the acquisition date onwards. This should be taken into account when looking at the 
intensity KPI's per FTE.
• For the companies merged during each reporting cycle, the FTE, EBITDA, and tons of 
product purchased indicators can no longer be separated as from the date of the 
merger. If transport transactions for these merged entities cannot be included in the 
calculations, this could lead to possible higher FTE and EBITDA values than actually 
associated with the included logistics transactions.
The organisational scope consists of group entities with a full year of transactional data in 
IMCD's global ERP system (scoped-in companies). For the Scope 3 emission calculation, the 
following transactions are included:
• sales with delivery from the stock to a customer and sales with direct delivery from 
supplier to the customer,
• purchases with delivery from a supplier to the stock.
Sales volumes based on transactional data are reconciled with sales volumes as used in 
the financial  records. Discrepancies were insignificant  in 2023.
Estimated GHG gases include CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3, and others. Biogenic 
emissions are not relevant as all transportation is assumed to be performed on 
fossil fuels. GHG trades are excluded from the calculation of other indirect (Scope 3) 
GHG emissions.The financial  control consolidation approach was consistently applied in 
reporting. 2019 is used as base year in the target setting towards 2024.
Energy intensity and GHG emissions intensity
Scope 1 and 2 along with Scope 3 total GHG emissions intensity is used to measure 
progress on our targets communicated in the Environment Value chapter. In this note 
we explain the developments in Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions in 2023 and our plans for 
further reductions.
Energy and GHG emissions intensity is calculated by dividing the respective energy 
consumption or amount of total energy consumption within the organisation, or total 
emissions (Scope 1 and 2, or Scope 1, 2, and 3) by the intensity base. Three intensity 
bases are used throughout the report for Scope 1 and 2 intensity and for Scope 1, 2 and 3 
intensity calculations:
• FTE: based on the primary data. In 2023, IMCD has 4,736 FTEs
• Mass of product sold: based on the primary data (2023: 1,038,968 tonnes)
• Operating EBITDA:
- (1) Total Operating EBITDA is taken based on primary data on the Group level. In 
2023, operating EBITDA is EUR 548 million.
- (2) Operating EBITDA per region is calculated as operating EBITDA generated by 
the companies of the region plus proportionally allocated operating EBITDA of 
the holding companies. In 2023 the following operating EBITDA used for EMEA: 
EUR 243 million, Asia-Pacific:  EUR 149 million, Americas: EUR 156 million.
For Scope 3 emission intensity calculation, the FTE, mass product sold and operating 
EBITDA of the group entities with a full year of transactional data in IMCD's global ERP 
system are used. For 2023, these are:
• FTE: 3,766 FTEs
• Mass of product sold: 933,769 tonnes
• Operating EBITDA: EUR 493 million
Note that for the total emission intensity (Scope 1, 2 and 3) calculation, Scope 1 and 2 
emissions include all group entities, whereas the Scope 3 emissions only relate to the 
group entities with a full year transactional data in IMCD's global ERP system. The divider 
used for the total emission intensity calculation, comprises all group entities.
Energy consumption and energy-related emissions in Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions intensity
Overall, 2023 showed positive results in terms of emission intensity for Scope 1 and 2, as 
well as for Scope 3, compared to our baseline year 2019.
Scope 1 and 2 emission intensity (per million euro of operating EBITDA) increased by 
11% compared with 2022 and decreased by 58% compared with 2019. The main driver 
for the decrease in Scope 1 and 2 emission intensity compared with the baseline year, 
is a combination of organic growth and acquisition impacts, increased EBITDA levels and 
optimisation of the energy consumption. Scope 1 and 2 energy consumption decreased by 
18% in the period 2019 to 2023.
Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity increased from 20 tCO2eq/mln euro in 2022 to 23 
tCO2eq/mln euro in 2023 (+11%). This can be explained by the lower level of EBITDA in 
2023, combined with 4% higher energy consumption.
Compared with baseline year 2019 and 2022, Scope 3 emission intensity decreased by 8% 
respectively 2% in 2023. Absolute emissions increased by 141% compared to 2019, mainly 
due to the number of entities included in the Scope 3 calculation.

Direct energy consumption and energy related emissions (Scope 1 and 2)
2023 showed an increase of 4% in both energy consumption as well as associated 
GHG emissions, compared with 2022. Compared with baseline year 2019, the energy 
consumption in 2023 as well as the GHG emissions decreased by 18%, respectively 7%. 
The increase in energy consumption in 2023 compared with 2022 is mainly the result of 
organic growth and the impact of acquisitions. The growth was more significant  in fuel 
consumption and the associated direct emissions (Scope 1), most prominently seen in 
increased petrol consumption. This is mainly the result of the business travels with the 
company's transport as well as additional petrol-fuelled cars of newly acquired entities. A 
number of group entities shifted from diesel-fuelled passenger cars towards petrol-fuelled.

In the period 2019 till 2023, energy consumption decreased by 18%. The most significant  decrease was realised in the Americas, followed by EMEA, whereas Asia-Pacific  showed an 
increase mainly due to its organic growth and recent acquisitions. Overall, in 2023, energy consumption increased by 4% compared to 2022. This increase can be attributed to the rise in 
petrol usage, particularly the transition from diesel to petrol-fuelled cars in countries like Turkey and France, increased business travels and customer visits and the increased electricity 
consumption resulting from new acquisitions across all regions.

In 2023, the Americas region experienced the most notable intensity increase, rising 
by 39% compared to 2022 primarily due to a 7% increase in energy consumption and 
12% increase of energy-related emissions. Simultaneously, the Americas region showed a 
decrease in operating EBITDA of 20%.
In EMEA, Scope 1 and 2 emission intensity increased by 4%, driven by a 2% rise in 
energy consumption alongside a 2% decline in operating EBITDA. In contrast, Asia-Pacific  
showed a 4% decline in emission intensity in 2023. This was attributed to a 4% increase in 
operating EBITDA, while energy-related emissions remain the same compared with 2022.

Emissions from third-party transportation (Scope 3)
Third-party transportation significantly  contributes to our Scope 3 carbon footprint. To 
address this, the company has established a comprehensive logistics database that 
carefully tracks emissions associated with the shipment of our products. The monitoring 
of third-party transportation emissions is closely related to the integration of IMCD Group 
companies into our ERP system. All group entities with a full year of transactional data 
in our global ERP system are included in the Scope 3 emissions calculation. Given IMCD's 
ongoing expansion and acquisitions, the on-boarding process continues which leads to an 
expansion of our reporting scope, hence to and increase in absolute emissions.
In 2023, while new operations were introduced and the scope expanded, the growth was 
modest compared to the significant  on-boarding efforts  of 2020 and 2021. The increase 
in absolute emissions was driven by the inclusion of two major countries (Australia and 
Signet, in India and China) into the 2023 scope. However, a decline in sales volumes 
and an increase in orders of smaller sizes by customers both had an impact on the 
absolute emissions. Consequently, the absolute increase observed in 2023 was lower than 
in previous years.
Third-party transportation emissions totalled 375 ktCO2eq in 2023 (2022: 338 ktCO2eq), 
representing a 11% increase from 2022 emissions, mainly due to the increase in scope of 
entities included in the calculation.
Road transport is responsible for the majority of emissions, accounting for 70% of total 
emissions. Air freight accounts for 21% of emissions, with sea freight accounting for the 
remaining 9%.
Transportation within the Americas continent is the largest contributor, accounting for 
about 44% of total emissions, due to the long distances travelled. Intraregional American 
transport is followed by intraregional EMEA transportation, which accounts for up to 22% 
of total emissions. America accounts for 48% of total Scope 3 transportation emissions, 
followed by EMEA (31%), and Asia Pacific  (21%).
Building on the retaining absolute emissions volume, the emissions intensity associated 
with third-party transportation decreased compared to 2022 on all bases, except in 
emissions per tonne sold. Emissions per FTE decreased by 10%, emission intensity per 
ton sold increased by 7% and emissions relative to the operating EBITDA decreased by 2%.

Integrated Report 2023
In 2023, the company's core emissions KPI, ktCO2eq emission intensity per million euro 
of operating EBITDA, was 760, compared with 777 in 2022 (-2%) and 825 (-8%) in 2019. 
IMCD and its business partners initiated projects to reduce emissions, such as supply chain 
optimisations and the implementation of more sustainable modes of transport.
Even though the vast majority of emissions intensity associated with third-party 
transportation decreased compared with 2022, the IMCD Sustainability Task Force 
identified  and acknowledged that the carbon footprint in absolute terms did not decrease, 
which was attributable to organic and acquisition growth of IMCD's business. IMCD, 
together with its logistics service providers, continue its efforts  to further reduce its carbon 
footprint in the supply chain.

Impacts on the economy, environment and people
The following actual and potential positive and negative impacts were identified  for this 
material topic with reference to GRI 3-3.
Environmental sustainability
IMCD's supply chain decarbonisation efforts  contribute to environmental sustainability 
by reducing GHG emissions associated with the transportation, warehousing and other 
supply chain activities related to the distribution of our products. By optimizing our 
logistics, and enhancing our monitoring scope and platform, IMCD can provide reliable 
information on carbon footprint and identify opportunities of improvement timely to 
mitigate negative impacts alongside our 3PLs.
Innovation and efficiency
Decarbonising the supply chain often involves adopting innovative technologies and 
processes that improve efficiency  and reduce waste. By promoting the investment in 
sustainable transportation, energy-efficient  operations, and order optimisation within 
our downstream 3PLs, IMCD fosters innovation and economic growth while minimising 
resource consumption and environmental degradation.
Market differentiation
IMCD's commitment to supply chain decarbonisation enhances its brand reputation 
and market competitiveness. As consumers and businesses increasingly prioritise 
sustainability, products and services with low carbon footprints are in high demand. By 
offering  environmentally responsible distribution services, IMCD can attract customers and 
gain a competitive edge in the marketplace.
Regulatory Compliance
Decarbonising the supply chain helps IMCD comply with evolving environmental 
regulations and sustainability standards. By proactively addressing carbon emissions and 
environmental impacts throughout the supply chain, IMCD reduces the risk of regulatory 
fines,  and reputational damage, ensuring long-term business continuity and resilience.

Integrated Report 2023
Costs and investment
Supply chain decarbonisation often requires significant  upfront investment in IT upgrades, 
infrastructure improvements, and employee training. These costs may strain IMCD's 
budget and human resources, particularly in locations where we maintain small operations 
and personnel.
Technological barriers
Some decarbonisation technologies may still be in the early stages of development 
or may not yet be economically viable for widespread adoption. IMCD may encounter 
technological challenges, such as limited availability of sustainable alternatives of transport 
or insufficient  infrastructure for renewable energy sources within our 3PLs base, which can 
delay progress toward our decarbonisation goals.
Transition challenges
Transitioning to a low-carbon supply chain may require organisational change and 
workforce retraining, which can create uncertainty and resistance among our suppliers, 
especially if it comes with a strong economic investment. Effective  collaboration strategies, 
and supplier engagement are essential for overcoming resistance and fostering a culture 
of sustainability within IMCD’s supply chain.
3.2 Eco-efficient operations
3.2.1 Water management
IMCD recognises that water is a valuable resource that should be preserved responsible 
along with the local communities where we run our business operations. Taking into 
consideration our business model and consumption of water mainly for the household-like 
purposes, this topic remains immaterial for IMCD, however we do promote water-saving 
practices in all of our facilities and internal processes.
We did not set any targets or water-related goals for 2023, however we keep an eye on 
water-related indicators as part of our reporting system. Moreover, we are continuously 
working to develop products that can help our customers to use water more responsibly 
in their operations. For example, biopharmaceuticals are known to have exceptionally 
high Process Mass Intensity (PMI) figures,  meaning for every 1kg of biological active 
product produced, typically ~7,000 to 8,000kg kg of raw materials are consumed, namely 
water in upstream and downstream processing. IMCD team is championing revised 
techniques to reduce the use of water and improve the CO2 footprint of biopharmaceutical 
manufacturing process also by promoting ‘adjuvants’ that can extend the viability of 
these biologics.
Methodology
Water consumption and wastewater
IMCD’s water consumption mainly relates to general household (cleaning, catering, 
and sanitation) in our offices,  laboratories and warehouses. Being light in assets and 
production facilities, IMCD uses relatively small volumes of water sourcing mainly from 
local water providers. We do not commonly source water ourselves, there are only two 
IMCD companies that harvest rainwater at the facilities, 11 sites that withdraw ground 
water, and only 2 facilities source surface water for internal processes.
Both water consumption and water withdrawal data are obtained from the sites in m3 
(1,000 litres) when possible. All sites use fresh water supplied by third parties (municipal 
water) apart from the own surface water withdrawal relating to rain water harvesting 
(1,633 m3 in 2023).
• For the sites that could not report water withdrawal, it was estimated based on floor  
area of the facility (primary data), function of the facility (primary data), and average 
water withdrawal per floor  area by the reported sites based on their function. Water 
discharge data is obtained from the sites in m3 (1,000 litres) when possible. The majority 
of the sites use water for near-to-domestic use purposes or for production (consumed 
in the process and is not discharged), and pass it on the third parties for treatment 
(assumed not fresh water at the moment of discharge) via the municipal sewage 
system. In 2023, 45,822 m3 of wastewater (2022: 40,387 m3) was discharged. A small 
portion of wastewater was discharged to other than the sewage system - amounting 
to 3,165 m3 of wastewater that was handed over to third parties not via the sewage 
system, either due to absence of a sewage system or due to specific  substances of 
concern. In 2023 four (2022: two) sites carry out non-hazardous waste water treatment 
themselves in accordance with the governmental standards before discharging the 
treated water to the ground water; no additional internal water quality standards or 
guidelines were developed. Five sites release wastewater to the surface.
• For sites that could not report water discharge, it was estimated based on the floor  
area of the facility (primary data), function of the facility (office  – primary data), and 
average water withdrawal per floor  area by the reported sites based on their function. 
This water is discharged via the sewage pipeline. Water consumption is based on local 
water withdrawal minus discharge. Water withdrawal reporting based on estimations 
accounts for 29% of the total in 2023 (2022: 32% ). Water discharge reporting based 
on estimations accounts for 38% of the total in 2023 (2022: 42%). No water storage 
was identified  as relevant for the companies of the group. Water stress areas are 
identified  as areas with baseline water stress level high (40-80%) or extremely high (over 
80%), based on the data from the World Resources Institute, Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas 
accessed on November 15th, 2023 for the levels in the reporting year 2023.

Integrated Report 2023
Wastewater
IMCD companies usually do not discharge water themselves, but instead send it to third 
parties for treatment. IMCD facilities with local discharge operations work under local 
water discharge legislation. In most of the cases, IMCD's wastewater generally has the 
same characteristics as municipal (domestic) wastewater and is therefore transferred to 
wastewater treatment facilities over a common pipeline. IMCD predominantly relies on 
local sewage systems for water treatment and, eventually, discharge. Two companies 
collect their wastewater in septic tanks and hand over its waste water to third parties 
for treatment and discharge. Two companies in Indonesia treat a considerable amount 
of their wastewater themselves in accordance with local standards and regulations and 
releases the treated water to ground water.
Water consumption and water intensity
Our global water consumption increased in 2023 by 42%, from 4,5 (1,000 m3) in 2022 to 6,3 
(1,000 m3) in 2023 . The increase was due mainly to the new acquisitions within Asia-Pacific  
region. The water consumption in water-stress areas doubled from 0,3 (1000 m3) in 2022 
to 0,6 (1,000 m3) in 2023. The intensity of the water consumption per ton of sales has 
increased by 55%, from 3.9 litre per tonne of sales to 6.1 litre per tonne of sales.

3.2.2 Waste management
Waste management has been one of the vital environmental issues for a few decades 
already. Even though IMCD does not generate huge amounts of waste that can 
cause significant  adverse effect  to our environment, we apply a responsible waste 
management approach to all our operations. Working with chemicals can involve 
generating considerable amounts of both hazardous and non-hazardous waste in the 
companies' operations as well through our supply chain. Therefore, IMCD is committed 
to meeting all required regulations by local laws and our internal policies, as well 
as requirements agreed with customers and suppliers regarding waste treatment and 
disposal. Furthermore, we encourage waste reduction in our value chain by promoting 
sustainable products and services in our product portfolio and supply chain.
Methodology
Operational waste management
Our own offices,  warehouses and limited production sites are the main sources of waste 
generation. Led by warehousing activities, the waste generated is predominantly non-
hazardous (any waste that causes no harm to human or environmental health, e.g. office  
waste: paper, boxes, folders, plastic, glass). However, certain processes in our laboratories 
and product storage activities result in the generation of hazardous waste (a solid waste or 
a combination of wastes, which because of its quantity, concentration, physical, chemical, 
or infectious characteristics poses a substantial or potential hazard to human health or the 
environment when not properly treated, stored, transported, disposed of or managed). 
To ensure that all waste generated by operations is properly identified  and sent for 
disposal by licensed companies in accordance with relevant laws and regulations, a global

waste disposal policy is in place as part of both the HSEQR Policy and the Supply Chain 
Management Policy. The waste disposal policy applies to supply-chain-related materials 
and office-related  waste.
All waste generated in our activities is transferred to third parties for treatment. Local 
HSEQR Managers are responsible for ensuring that disposals are conducted in compliance 
with local laws and regulations by accredited disposal companies. In its offices  and at other 
locations, IMCD promotes recycling of used materials and minimising paper consumption.
IMCD promotes the recycling of used material and minimising paper consumption in our 
offices  and at other locations. In our effort  to improve the quality of data reporting, in 
2023 we again have full factual assessment of hazardous waste generation and both 
estimated/factual for non-hazardous waste. In 2023 37% of the reported non-hazardous 
waste generation is based on estimations (2022: 54%).
Waste generation by type
Data on hazardous and non-hazardous waste generation is obtained from the sites 
in metric tonnes (1,000kg). All reporting locations base hazardous waste generation 
on factual data. When factual verified  data on non-hazardous waste is not available, 
estimations are made:
• For plastic, paper, glass and bio-waste fractions collected separately: based on the 
maximum quantity for which removal companies are contracted for, or in case waste is 
not segregated, based on the average number of bins and/or containers removed per 
week, multiplied by respective volume and density.
• For electronic and electric waste: based on the average number of employees.
• For other non-hazardous waste, based on the maximum quantity for which removal 
companies are contracted for; based on the average number of bins removed per week, 
multiplied by respective volume and density; or based on the reported floor  area and a 
default rate of waste generation per m2/year.
• Effluents  are excluded from waste generation calculations, unless it is required by local 
legislation to be reported under total waste.
Based on the information provided by the sites, all sites pass on waste to third parties 
for treatment.
Hazardous and non-hazardous waste generated
Both hazardous and non-hazardous waste generated in 2023 showed a slight increase 
of 4% compared to 2022. This is mainly caused by the new acquisitions. In its offices  
and at other locations, IMCD promotes the recycling of used material and minimising 
paper consumption. In our effort  to improve the quality of data reporting, in 2023 
we continued the 2022 achievement of a full factual assessment of hazardous waste 
generation. Generation of non-hazardous waste remains almost the same of last year 
comprising of 1,869t in 2023 (2022: 1,880t).

Hazardous waste generation in 2023 has increased by 22% compared to 2022 from 429t 
in 2022 to 523t in 2023. Major contributors are 4 sites: South Africa, Mexico, Brazil, and 
Indonesia. This can be explained by the accumulated amount of disposal for several years 
in a row which led to the spike of waste at the end of 2023. Approximately 49% of the 
hazardous waste was generated in third-party facilities and 51% on IMCD's own premises.

3.2.3 Raw materials
Methodology
As per IMCD’s context, materials used to supply our production processes, such as 
repackaging (e.g. paper, cardboard and plastic, metallic and plastic drums). The sum 
of weight of each type of packaging is expressed in kg predominantly based on direct 
measurements - factual data comprised of 95% in the reporting period. Estimated raw 
materials comprised of 5% only and the material use (per material type) calculated as: 
mass of the packaging material per one unit, multiplied by registered number of products 
packaged per year.
Materials consist of either renewable or non-renewable components.
• Renewable material: material that is derived from plentiful resources that are quickly 
replenished by ecological cycles or agricultural processes.
• Non-renewable material: material derived from a resource that does not renew in short 
time periods.
Raw Materials as the source for repackaging
As a distributor, IMCD has only minor own production facilities, which predominantly deal 
with repackaging. As such, most of the materials used at our facilities are associated with 
repackaging materials. The materials used in the production and repackaging processes in 
2023 totalled 974t (2022: 807t), of which 31% (2022: 29%) were renewable materials.
Raw Materials, tonnes

Non-Renewable 669 69% 575 71%
Total 974 100% 807 100%
3.3 Climate strategy
Reference is made to the section addressing the Recommendations of the Task Force on 
Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), see section 2 Recommendations of the Task 
force on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).
Impacts on the economy, environment and people
The following actual and potential positive and negative impacts were identified  for this 
material topic with reference to GRI 3-3.
Risk mitigation
IMCD's climate strategy, enables the identification  and mitigation of climate-related risks. 
By assessing physical risks such as extreme weather events, and transition risks like policy 
changes and market shifts, IMCD can proactively adapt its operations and investments to 
minimise potential negative sustainability-related impacts.
Opportunity identification
IMCD's climate strategy is aimed to identify opportunities for innovation and growth in the 
transition to a low-carbon economy. By leveraging the EU Taxonomy framework, IMCD is 
able to identify sustainable investments and activities that could contribute positively to 
climate mitigation and adaptation.
Stakeholder engagement
By disclosing climate-related risks and opportunities in line with TCFD recommendations, 
IMCD fosters transparency and trust among stakeholders, enhances investor confidence,  
and strengthens partnerships with suppliers, customers, and communities committed to 
climate action.
Supply Chain disruptions
Climate-related events, such as extreme weather events or disruptions to raw material 
supplies, may negatively impact IMCD's supply chain and operations. Despite efforts  to 
mitigate risks, vulnerabilities within the supply chain could lead to delays, increased costs, 
and reputational damage, affecting  the economy, environment, and people dependent on 
IMCD's products and services.
Regulatory compliance
Changes in climate-related regulations and policies may require IMCD to adapt its 
business practices and operations to remain compliant. Compliance costs, administrative 
burdens, and regulatory uncertainties could pose challenges for IMCD's operations and

competitiveness, particularly if regulatory requirements vary across regions or are subject 
to frequent changes.
Transition risks
The transition to a low-carbon economy may pose risks to certain industries, technologies, 
or business models that are heavily reliant on fossil fuels or high-carbon activities. IMCD 
has eight Business Groups that attend different  industry sectors. Thus, IMCD's portfolio 
of products and services may face challenges in navigating the transition to a low-carbon 
economy, including market shifts and changes. IMCD is currently developing a KPI for its 
Climate Strategy that considers the above-mentioned impacts and prioritises the adoption 
of climate-related opportunities to ensure its long-term profitability.

4 Product
4.1 Sustainable solutions
IMCD drives Sustainable Solutions in the market when it champions the journey of its 
suppliers and simplifies  the business and the sustainability landscape for its customers.
Definition and Methodology
Sustainable Solutions aims to support our customers in navigating the complexities of 
green solutions and make it easier to:
• explore extensive sustainable materials, educational content, regulations, 
and opportunities.
• evaluate which materials are suitable for their unique needs.
• elect to switch to using greener solutions in the production of their products.
The solutions are organised into sustainable categories which reflect  the market needs. 
For example, there are eight categories for the Advanced Materials business group: 
renewable source; CO2 reduction; recycling; biodegradable; compostable; end-of-life 
enhancement; waste reduction; and weight reduction. We have identified  a gap in our 
industry in terms of access to sustainability resources that are educational, actionable, and 
measurable, and we are committed to creating such resources.
Based on our market knowledge we see attractive opportunities for products and 
formulations with a sustainable profile  as they generally tend to offer  above market 
growth potential and differentiation.  The initial step was to define  a systematic 
methodology to identify opportunities in our portfolio, taking into market trends, existing 
and coming regulations as well as consumer pressure. We started recently to apply this to 
the Advanced Materials product portfolio and intend to roll this out progressively to other 
Business Groups in the course of 2024.
We engage with our top principal suppliers as well as with customers and associations 
to collect the most important information needed to implement greener solutions. 
This market intelligence, together with our technical expertise and product know-how, 
will enable us to define  the Sustainable Solutions that should be at the forefront of 
the industry.
Products that meet the sustainability criteria and have the supporting scientific  data for 
our suppliers' claims or from our labs are tagged in our product data system and are 
marketed as sustainable solutions.
This enables IMCD's commercial teams to engage with customers, discuss the business 
case for alternatives, and push more sustainable solutions. We enable our customers and 
suppliers to make informed sustainable decisions throughout their product creation.
IMCD has developed 73 laboratories into a global network of technical centres that 
support its business partners with high-quality technical advice and formulation expertise. 
IMCD's scientists and technical teams analyse market trends and new technologies, share 
their technical expertise and product formulations, process and application knowledge to 
support the sustainable innovations of both its suppliers and customers.
4.2 Safe handling and distribution
Given the company's function as a speciality chemicals distributor, IMCD must ensure 
the safe handling and distribution of its product line. IMCD ensures that chemicals 
are handled safely and reliably, that warehouse operations and transportation comply 
with all necessary regulations, and that waste processing and disposal adhere to the 
highest standards to avoid spills or negative environmental impact. Together with our 
suppliers, we ensure the quality and safety of our product portfolio and compliance with 
environmental, health and safety standards and regulations.
As a chemical distributor, IMCD's everyday operations focus upon the handling, storage, 
and transportation of both non-hazardous and hazardous materials. As a result, we 
prioritize protecting our employees, communities, and ecosystems by handling chemicals 
safely and responsibly. Our goal is to prevent spills and chemical mishandling in 
our operations. Our global HSEQR Policy and global procedures, as specified  by our 
headquarters' global HSEQR function, provide the fundamental principles of chemical 
handling in our activities. The policy provides recommendations for the establishment 
and execution of local procedures and processes by the individual local IMCD 
operating companies.
Our worldwide HSEQR Policy and procedures require continuous reporting from our 
local operating companies to the Group headquarters, from which local processes and 
procedures are formed. Based on these continual reports, an analysis is undertaken to 
identify potential policy, process, or procedure changes that require action or amendment. 
During audits of local operating companies by IMCD's Group Internal Audit Staff,  the 
implementation of the HSEQR controls is reviewed and deficiencies  reported. Corrective 
action plans are prepared and tracked in our global risk management system.
For example, at the Group level, a global crisis communication procedure has been 
implemented, which is consistent with local emergency management procedures. Within

these local emergency management procedures, each IMCD operating business specifies  
communication routes, roles, and responsibilities in the event of an incident.
As part of the procedure, a first  point of contact for crisis and emergency situations 
must be appointed. This person must be thoroughly trained and capable of coordinating 
communication with all essential stakeholders. Furthermore, the corporate website 
includes IMCD's 24-hour emergency response line, which can be used to communicate 
in the event of a crisis. If an emergency occurs, it will be handled locally and reported to 
IMCD headquarters for further investigation.
IMCD's product quality and safety procedures and processes are focused on assessing 
our suppliers' products and ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
governing safety, quality, and labelling, as IMCD is committed to providing its customers 
with products and services that meet all of their requirements without compromise.
Given the expanding number of products in our portfolio, we have instituted a stringent 
item creation process to ensure safe and responsible product management. This 
procedure obtains and validates mandatory information needed before the product sales 
process begins. For example, IMCD shall make a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) available in the 
relevant language if necessary. Our principal suppliers issue the majority of our SDSs, 
which are then evaluated and authorised by our local HSEQR managers before being 
placed in our global database.
A SDS comprises information about each chemical's characteristics, physical and 
environmental health hazards, protective measures, and safety precautions for handling, 
storing, and transporting the chemical. Our third-party logistics service providers use 
the SDS information to create transport documents, labels, and workplace safety and 
storage plans.
As part of our commitment to safe and responsible product distribution, our local 
HSEQR managers verify that all products supplied by us meet local labelling criteria, 
including information on content, component source, and environmental or social effect.  
Established labelling processes are utilised for hazardous products to educate the user 
about the hazard(s) as well as the risks associated with handling the material. Every order 
and product that leaves our warehouses is accompanied by a certificate  of analysis (COA), 
SDS, and, if necessary, a Dangerous Goods Declaration (DGD). To prevent errors, this 
information is transmitted digitally. All labels have a 24-hour helpline number.
Carechem 24 is our multilingual telephone advice service providing access to a team of 
trained responders, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Carechem 24 provides support in 
dealing with emergency product support during a hazardous material incident. This service 
helps compliance with responsible care and regulations associated with the transport and 
handling of dangerous goods while minimising the overall impact and risk to people, the 
environment, assets, and reputation.
During 2023 we updated our Non-Conformance Reporting (NCR) and rolled it out 
to all IMCD operating companies. IMCD uses NCRs on a global scale to report and 
drive continuous improvement. We have been utilising this technology to accurately 
report internal and external cases of non-compliance due to faulty labelling, markings, 
or paperwork.
Our approach to our quality management system (QMS) is based on systems and 
certifications  supplied by internationally recognised organisations. Through this approach, 
we can ensure that our business processes are always focused on meeting customer 
requirements and raising satisfaction. Based on legal and market requirements, IMCD's 
operating companies have implemented reputable management systems such as 
Responsible Care or Responsible Distribution for quality management, ISO 14001 for 
environmental management (by year-end 2023, 46% of the total workforce worked at 
ISO 14001 certified  sites; 2022: 40%), ISO 22000/HACCP/BRC for food safety management, 
and GMP+ for good manufacturing practices for food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic 
products. GDP for good distribution practices for food, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics; 
and ECO for organic items. The majority of IMCD's operational companies engage in the 
International Council of Chemical organizations' (ICCA) 'Responsible Care' or 'Responsible 
Distribution' programmes via local organisations, pledging to long-term development and 
adherence to the global programme's requirements. Independent third-party experts 
assess conformity with these principles and regulations using the appropriate regional 
evaluation procedures. Independent experts additionally investigate and document the 
operating company's environmental performance and chemical safety.
All IMCD's operating companies must adopt quality management systems that meet 
the internationally renowned ISO 9001:2015 standard. With more operational companies 
certified  in 2023, 78% of our total workforce now works at sites with ISO 9001:2015- 
certified  quality management systems (2022: 75%).
As a consequence of the integration of acquired companies that were not certified  when 
they were incorporated into IMCD, the global coverage rate for ISO 14001 and ISO 
9001:2015 is 6% and 3% higher in 2023 than in 2022 respectively. The effect  on the overall

number varies depending on the extent of the acquisitions completed each year. Our 
commitment to the highest level of quality and safety in our operations, which applies to 
all of our enterprises, remains unchanged.
In 2023, there were no reported non-hazardous spills, compared to one in 2022. However, 
there was one hazardous spill in the reporting period (2022: two). The spill occurred in 
Indonesia, involving 200 kg of hazardous material - genamic ctac 25. Prompt corrective 
action was taken, containing the spill with sand and arranging for its safe disposal by a 
third party. The affected  area underwent thorough decontamination and was reinforced 
with safety signage. Personnel involved in the relevant processes received additional 
Health & Safety training to reinforce awareness and safe practices. The spill did not do 
harm to the environment, waterways, or humans, as it was professionally handled before 
any contact with it.
In order to incorporate the continuous lessons learned in this topic and evaluate its 
unbiased effectiveness,  IMCD is working with an external auditor who is independent and 
critical in objectively strengthening the audits' efficiency  and credibility. This measure is in 
addition to the policies implemented by IMCD's Global HSEQR Department.
4.3 Sustainable procurement
Approach and Organisation
In our procurement approach, we aim to safeguard ethical and sustainable sourcing from 
our suppliers and service providers, in order to ensure responsible environmental, social 
and governance practices.
To better embed sustainable procurement in its organisation, in 2023, IMCD appointed 
(global) programme leaders for (i) the upstream principals / suppliers and (ii) the 
downstream logistics service providers. Both roles report to the Global Supply Chain and 
HSEQR Director, responsible for sustainable procurement, and reporting to IMCD's COO, 
who has end-responsibility for the topic (and fulfil  the role of Chief Procurement Officer). 
On local level, the supply chain and HSEQR employees carry out the procurement 
activities, collaborate with third-party logistics providers and product suppliers in their 
respective regions, monitor ESG performance using the EcoVadis platform and IMCD ESG 
screening tool, and carry out audits.
Policies - ESG Standards for IMCD Business Partners
To ensure responsible environmental, social, and governance practices, IMCD requires 
ethical and sustainable sourcing from its product suppliers and third-party logistical 
service providers. Sustainable procurement is a critical enabler of the major focus areas of 
supply chain decarbonisation and sustainable solutions.
IMCD is committed to implementing solid sustainability standards in order to obtain 
products and logistical services that are sustainable, ethical, and responsible. By focusing 
on local suppliers, we contribute to strengthen the local economies in which we operate.
IMCD plays a unique position in the supply chain, connecting the principal supplier and 
customer. As a distributor, we are considered an extension of our principals' sales force. 
We operate an outsourced logistics strategy, working with logistics service providers on 
warehousing, shipping, sampling, and repacking. As a result, our value in supply chain 
sustainability lies in our capacity to influence  the logistics service provider landscape and 
improve their ESG performance.
We have a sustainable procurement policy and global procedures in place to source 
products or logistical services at the Group level. Externally, we have set standards for 
our business partners that explain what we expect from them in the field  of ESG; the 
ESG Standards for IMCD Business Partners, available on our website. Throughout 2023, 
we continued to engage with our third-party logistics providers to increase awareness and 
adherence to this vendor code of conduct.
The ESG Standards are included into IMCD's contractual agreements with business 
partners via either the business partner's signature or a contractual condition in a 
subsequent contract. Furthermore, we expect our business partners to guarantee that 
their own agents and subcontractors follow the guidelines back-to-back.
In 2023, 95% of existing third-party logistics service providers based on 2023 spending 
have signed to our ESG standards for IMCD Business Partners, demonstrating their 
willingness to collaborate to improve ESG performance. We have also added a 
commitment to the ESG Standards in our contract templates and future procurement 
criteria for third-party services. For the remuneration purposes, 98% of existing third-party 
logistics service providers based on 2022 spending that have signed to our ESG standards 
for IMCD Business Partners were taken into consideration.
As an additional initiative, IMCD launched an EcoVadis assessment for important logistics 
service providers, with 88% of these ESG evaluated downstream suppliers by the end 
of 2023 based on FY 2023 spend. 91% of upstream suppliers CSR or in the process of 
being rated by EcoVadis were also evaluated based on FY 2023 spend. IMCD expanded 
its collaboration with EcoVadis through Together for Sustainability (TfS) during 2023

to establish aligned tools for supplier evaluation and a global framework of shared 
infrastructure. In alignment with TfS standards, assessment validity is up to three years 
based on supplier’s EcoVadis score.
For the remuneration purposes, 93% of these ESG third-party logistics service providers 
based on 2022 spending were taken into consideration.
Further developments in 2023
In 2023, IMCD continued to analyse the sustainability performance of its business partners, 
with a focus on its downstream supply chain and enhanced partnership with EcoVadis 
and TfS.
We broadened our sustainable procurement programme by including TfS audits and 
collaborating with suppliers on education and corrective measures. We started to widen 
the scope and include the upstream product supply chain as well.
We believe that working together will result in more sustainable, transparent, and resilient 
supply chains.
Prior to engagement, IMCD assesses third-party service providers' compliance. The types 
and amounts of products held or carried by the third-party service provider determine 
how frequently an assessment is undertaken. All new third-party logistics service providers 
have been evaluated based on social and environmental factors before being contracted. 
During our appointment process, we assess third-party service providers' sustainability 
objectives, goals, and progress.
In terms of social requirements, service providers must have proper health and safety 
precautions in place, as approved by credible organisations. We have implemented a 
human rights and labour practices check that applies to both new and existing service 
suppliers. As a consequence of this screening, a potential service provider may be 
accepted with or without minor revisions, put on hold until the necessary improvements 
are made, or denied approval.
IMCD requires third-party service providers to hold quality management certifications  
(such as ISO 9001 and Responsible Care) and to explain how they manage relevant 
environmental consequences in accordance with local regulations. Furthermore, IMCD has 
implemented procedures aimed at ensuring that third-party service providers comply with 
all applicable health, safety, environmental, and legal criteria. As part of our sustainable 
partnership, we conduct many projects with our partners every year to reduce the effect  of 
our products both upstream and downstream in the supply chain. Our non-conformance 
reporting mechanism, which is bolstered by quarterly on-site business evaluations, keeps 
careful track of service level agreements and standard operating procedures.
Because of the nature of IMCD's business, which entails collaborating with prominent 
international suppliers of speciality chemicals and ingredients, IMCD companies source 
a large amount of their products from foreign suppliers. Nonetheless, IMCD likes to 
collaborate with mid-sized and like-minded local businesses for logistics and other 
services. IMCD supports collaborations with local service providers in which both parties 
benefit.  Local suppliers are companies that offer  a product or service to an IMCD company 
and are located in the same geographic area. In 2023, 87% of services and non-tradable 
items were acquired locally (compared to 85% in 2022). For this purpose, all companies 
were deemed to have significant  operational locations.
Impacts on the economy, environment and people
The following actual and potential positive and negative impacts were identified  for this 
material topic with reference to GRI 3-3.
Environmental sustainability
IMCD's sustainable procurement practices promote the sourcing of materials, products 
and logistic services that minimise environmental impact. By choosing suppliers with 
strong environmental credentials, IMCD reduces pollution, and contributes to long-term 
environmental sustainability in collaboration with the supply chain.
Social responsibility
IMCD’s sustainable procurement programme, in line with the TfS strategy, emphasises 
ethical labour practices, human rights, and social inclusion throughout the supply chain. 
By working with suppliers who uphold fair labour standards, respect workers' rights, 
and promote diversity and inclusion, IMCD contributes to social equity and improves the 
livelihoods of workers and communities dependent on our supply chain.
Economic development
Our sustainable procurement practices can support economic development by prioritising 
local sourcing, fair trade, and small business partnerships. By investing in local suppliers 
and communities, IMCD stimulates economic activity, creates job opportunities, and 
fosters entrepreneurship.

Risk Management
This material topic helps mitigate risks associated with supply chain disruptions, regulatory 
non-compliance, and reputational damage. By conducting due diligence on suppliers, 
assessing their sustainability-related risks, and implementing supplier monitoring and 
auditing processes, IMCD reduces the likelihood of adverse impacts on its operations, 
finances,  and reputation.
Costs and price premiums
IMCD's sustainable procurement practices may involve higher costs or price premiums 
compared to conventional sourcing methods. Investments in sustainability assessments or 
certifications,  compliance with ethical standards, and supplier development programmes 
can increase procurement costs for IMCD and its suppliers in scope.
Supply Chain complexity
The implementation of our Sustainable procurement programme may increase complexity 
in IMCD's supply chain management processes. Identifying sustainable suppliers, 
assessing their environmental and social performance, and monitoring compliance with 
sustainability criteria requires additional resources and expertise, particularly due to our 
global supply chains with diverse suppliers and stakeholders.
Supplier relations
Adopting sustainable procurement practices may strain relationships with existing 
suppliers or limit options for sourcing certain materials or products. Suppliers may resist 
changes to their operations or may not meet IMCD's sustainability criteria, leading to 
conflicts  or disruptions in the supply chain. Therefore, IMCD promotes collaborative 
partnerships and provides support for supplier capacity-building and transition through 
the close interaction of our Product Management and Supply Chain Management teams 
with our business partners, and the provision of EcoVadis and TfS learning platforms to 
help mitigate these challenges.
Limited availability
In some cases, sustainable alternatives may have limited availability or may not meet 
the performance or quality standards required by IMCD and its customers. This can 
restrict the adoption of sustainable procurement practices and hinder progress towards 
our sustainability goals. IMCD’s collaboration with suppliers and industry partners through 
the TfS initiative is focused on developing and scaling sustainable product and logistics 
solutions to address these limitations.
4.4 Digitalisation
IMCD is digitalising its business processes further to optimise its omni-channel business 
model and best link customer needs to suppliers’ expertise in an efficient  and value-
creating manner. Digitalisation can be regarded as a sustainability enabler to address the 
core focus areas of Sustainable Solutions and Supply Chain Decarbonisation.
Digital transformation enables sustainability across three areas, which are the main pillars 
of the programme:
Core systems and Integrations
IMCD continues to optimise its global processes for pre-sales and sales, the supply 
chain, health, safety, quality, sustainability and finance  & control in order to assure 
operational excellence and an ongoing high level of service to our business partners. 
Operational improvements are facilitated using sophisticated, modern, integrated IT 
solutions supported by external specialists. The following digitalisation efforts  have been 
undertaken to further enhance our sustainability management programme.
• Integrating sustainability into value propositions and customer experiences, enabled by 
data visibility for end-users.
• Building capabilities needed to adapt to digital business models that improve the 
promotion and sales of sustainable products and support customers in navigating the 
complexities of green solutions.
• Promoting sustainable solutions that help address societal challenges arising 
from increased climate change awareness and the transition towards a more 
circular economy.
• Building cloud-based capabilities for making well-informed decisions to use resources 
and services more efficiently  and thus enable sustainability initiatives.
• Exchanging data insights within the organisation and with partners to optimise 
supply chain decarbonisation, and using data to support actions while ensuring data 
compliance, privacy, and security.

insights. The global and local digital marketing teams collaborate in IMCD's global 
marketing network, sharing best practices and learnings.
In 2023, we continued the roll-out and scale-up of the MyIMCD portal, our B2B platform 
that provides access to product information and documentation and order information, 
while also offering  facilities to request product samples, place orders, and collaborate with 
our technical sales teams on a 24/7 basis. Our MyIMCD portal plays an important role in 
giving our customers access to our sustainable solutions.
Support by IMCD's IT function
IMCD's IT function, continues to support the digital transformation of the group by 
involvement in different  digital transformation projects, like Sales/Buyer enablement, 
MyIMCD and Customer Care 360. IMCD's IT department is focused on business alignment 
by implementing modern and integrated business applications adequately supporting 
business processes, growth and digital transformation.
The Group IT platform contains IMCD's core applications, including: ERP, CRM, Business 
Intelligence (BI) and marketing automation, financial  consolidation and reporting, content 
and contract management, data warehouse and collaboration and communication. In 
2023, we managed to onboard 20 acquired entities to the group IT platform. Despite 
challenges to find  proper IT resources, we were able to keep our IT organisation steady.
IMCD's IT integration team is an established core department that has matured over the 
past few years. The investments made in integrations start to pay off  in various business 
projects, ranging from classical (supply chain focused) EDI connections, to new API based 
CRM-to-CRM connections with principals. Our integration platform and team support 
multiple scenarios for integration with suppliers, customers and other business partners, 
and is fundamental for further business process automation. The integration platform has 
been enriched with automation capabilities, like Robotic Process Automation (RPA).
IMCD's BI team delivers dashboards and underlying data architecture to support all 
business functions. This department developed from a classical BI function to a modern 
data management organisation. In 2023 many new and improved dashboards were 
delivered, including forecasting and cross-selling functionalities. Data management is an 
area of continuous investment from the group to provide workflows,  dashboards and 
governance to the IMCD Business Groups and countries to facilitate completeness and 
accuracy of all data objects and attributes. We closely follow the new developments in AI, 
and started with the exploration of generative AI in several areas such as generation of 
texts and improvement of data quality.
We follow an agile approach in adopting new AI technologies and will look for business 
use-cases both on the commercial as on the operational excellence side, but remain 
cautious when it comes to regulations and security.
Data & Analytics
The IMCD digital transformation programme is a major Group strategic initiative, driven 
first  and foremost in a consolidated manner across the regions and Business Groups by 
IMCD's Management Board.
Performance, adoption, and data-quality KPIs have been introduced and are visualised in 
stand-alone and application-embedded dashboard tools.
Current enterprise architecture supports coherent representation of data and numbers. 
From this single record of truth, managers can plan, execute, and evaluate in a data-driven 
manner and through the systems.
Impacts on the economy, environment and people
The following actual and potential positive and negative impacts were identified  for this 
material topic with reference to GRI 3-3.
Increased efficiency
Digitalisation of processes within IMCD can lead to increased efficiency  and productivity. 
Automation of repetitive tasks, streamlined workflows,  and real-time data analytics enable 
IMCD to operate more efficiently,  reducing costs and improving profitability.  This efficiency  
can contribute to economic growth by freeing up resources for investment in innovation 
and expansion.
Enhanced customer experience
Digitalisation allows IMCD to offer  improved customer experiences through our online 
platforms, e-commerce solutions, and personalised services. Customers benefit  from 
greater convenience, access to a wider range of products, and faster response times, 
leading to increased satisfaction and loyalty. A positive customer experience can drive 
repeat business and attract new customers, stimulating economic activity.
Environmental sustainability
Digitalisation can contribute to environmental sustainability by reducing paper usage 
and carbon emissions associated with traditional business practices. Remote working 
arrangements, virtual meetings, and digital document management systems can help

reduce IMCD's carbon footprint, contributing to environmental conservation and our 
climate mitigation efforts. 
Skills development
IMCD's digitalisation initiatives provide opportunities for skills development and learning 
among our workforce. Training programmes on digital tools, software platforms, and 
data analytics empower employees to adapt to technological changes and enhance their 
capabilities, improving job satisfaction and employability.
Digital divide
Not all our stakeholders may have equal access to digital tools, technologies, and 
training opportunities. The digital divide can exacerbate inequalities, particularly among 
underserved communities. IMCD ensures that its digitalisation efforts  are inclusive and 
accessible to all stakeholders, addressing challenges such as language barriers and access 
to technology.
Cybersecurity risks
Digitalisation introduces new cybersecurity risks, including data breaches, hacking, 
and malware attacks. A cyber attack could compromise sensitive information, disrupt 
operations, and damage IMCD's reputation. To mitigate these risks, IMCD ensures robust 
cybersecurity measures, employee training, and incident response protocols to protect 
against cyber threats and safeguard data privacy.
Environmental impact of technology
While digitalisation can contribute to environmental sustainability in some areas, it may 
also have unintended environmental consequences. The production, use, and disposal 
of electronic devices and infrastructure components can generate electronic waste (e-
waste) and contribute to resource depletion and pollution. In addition, more digitalisation 
initiatives also imply an increase in energy consumption. IMCD is currently developing 
a KPI for Digitalisation that considers its above-mentioned impacts and prioritises 
sustainable technology solutions.

5 Ethics and compliance
5.1 Ethics and Compliance
Compliance approach and organisation
IMCD 's compliance programme is supported by a compliance function throughout the 
Group organisation. This function is headed by the Group Compliance Officer,  supported 
by regional compliance officers  as well as country compliance representatives, either in 
stand-alone roles or combined with a senior management position. In line with best 
practices for proper corporate governance, the Group Compliance Officer  reports to the 
CEO, and has access to the chair of IMCD’s Supervisory Board.
In day-to-day management, there is close collaboration between the compliance function 
and IMCD's legal department, as well as with dedicated roles within other Group 
Departments for specific  topics. Examples of this are collaboration with the HSEQR 
Department in respect of trade sanctions and export control, with the HR Department 
on on-boarding and training efforts,  and with the Internal Audit and Corporate Control 
functions on actions for topics such as anti-bribery, anti-corruption, fraud prevention, and 
internal investigations.
IMCD's internal control and risk management systems are used to assess risks relating to 
ethics and compliance and is used by the Management Board and Supervisory Board, as 
well as local management, to continuously monitor performance.
Compliance framework
The IMCD Code of Conduct and IMCD Business Principles, which contain a clear set of 
values and shared standards, are intended to guide our employees in their behaviour 
and interactions, and support the desired ethical conduct within our organisation. Clear 
prohibitions are included as well. For questions that the Code of Conduct and Business 
Principles do not answer directly, our employees are encouraged to consult with local 
management and/or the Group Compliance Officer. 
The Code of Conduct and Business Principles apply to all IMCD employees worldwide. They 
are regularly updated, so that they maintain their relevance as guidance and as a true 
reflection  of IMCD’s culture. The latest version of the Code of Conduct was published in 
June 2022. It is available in 10 languages in addition to English.
The Code of Conduct is publicly available to all stakeholders on IMCD's corporate website. 
IMCD employees receive the latest version of the Code of Conduct and IMCD Business 
Principles while following their global compliance training programme and have access to 
all group policies via a dedicated compliance section on IMCD's intranet, through which 
they are also informed of any changes.
Core elements for compliance
Combatting corruption, bribery and fraud
Prevention of corruption, bribery and fraud is a core element in IMCD's compliance 
framework. All IMCD employees must strictly adhere to all anti-bribery and anti-corruption 
laws in force nationally and internationally. IMCD employees are prohibited from giving, 
offering,  or authorising bribes or facilitation payments. Potential breaches of the policies in 
place to prevent corruption, bribery or fraud can damage IMCD's reputation and present a 
financial  risk. IMCD therefore applies a 'zero-tolerance’ approach, which is detailed in our 
Code of Conduct.
IMCD has group-wide policies and guidelines in place to support and guide employees on 
these topics. These policies include clear examples of behaviour that must be avoided and 
cover instructions on gifts, hospitality, donations and political involvement, and avoiding 
conflicts  of interest. The anti-corruption guidance applies to all employees equally. Our 
employees always have access to the latest versions of company policies via a dedicated 
compliance section on IMCD’s intranet. Training on anti-corruption-, bribery- and fraud-
prevention is a mandatory part of IMCD's online e-learning programme, which supports 
the compliance framework.
The definitions  used for corruption, fraud and bribery within IMCD follow international 
legislation and frameworks, to which IMCD committed itself, for example the United 
Nations Global Compact. Corruption is an umbrella term and can take many forms that 
vary in degree from the minor use of influence  to institutionalised bribery. In IMCD's 
policies and (reporting) instructions, bribery is defined  to include the (promise of) granting, 
accepting or promise of any kind of undue reward, being anything of value, including the 
provision of any service, gift or entertainment or otherwise, with the object of influencing  
or inducing the behaviour or business decisions of other parties. This also includes acts of 
illegal facilitation payments or money-laundering. For fraud, we ask our teams to report 
any encountered (alleged) intentional act by IMCD employees, including management, or 
by third parties, involving the use of deception to obtain an unjust or illegal advantage 
(negatively effecting  IMCD). This includes acts of theft or misuse of company property, 
as well as other forms of employee fraud (for example with expense reimbursements, 
travelling costs or related to fake or undue payments).
Towards third parties, IMCD has implemented the ESG Standards for IMCD Business 
Partners. The ESG Standards for IMCD Business Partners apply to all business partners

in IMCD's supply chain and sets minimum requirements for ethical business conduct, 
including clear instructions and prohibitions with respect to corruption, bribery and fraud. 
The ESG standards are published on IMCD's website and as such, available to all IMCD's 
business partners. Specifically  for third party logistic partners, IMCD has decided to 
request a signature in acknowledgement.
As a further means to ensure compliance by all IMCD subsidiaries, employees can report 
suspected irregularities or behaviour that may indicate a breach of IMCD’s policies or 
national and international corruption legislation through IMCD’s Internal Alert Procedure 
and IMCD Ethics and Compliance Hotline.
The two confirmed  compliance incidents concerning corruption, bribery or (employee) 
fraud are described in more detail on page 69 in the Performance 2023 section of the 
Integrated Report.
Preventing anti-competitive behaviour
To guide employees in their behaviour, IMCD group policies includes a Competition Law 
Code of Conduct. This Code includes examples of behaviour that may pose a risk and must 
be avoided. In case of any doubt, IMCD encourages employees to consult management 
and/or ask IMCD's Group Compliance Officer  for advice.
Training on antitrust law is a mandatory part of IMCD's online e-learning programme, 
which supports the compliance framework. As a further means to ensure compliance by 
all IMCD subsidiaries, employees can report suspected irregularities or behaviour that may 
indicate a breach of IMCD’s antitrust policies through IMCD’s Internal Alert Procedure and 
IMCD Ethics and Compliance Hotline.
VIOLATIONS OF ANTI-COMPETITIVE LAWS OR REGULATIONS 2023 2022
Confirmed  compliance incidents concerning anticompetitive behaviour 0 0
Pending or completed legal proceedings concerning competition 
law breaches
0 0
In 2023, no violations of IMCD's Competition Law Code of Conduct were reported, 
signifying that there were no incidents, nor were there any pending or completed 
legal proceedings.
Regulatory compliance, trade sanctions and export control
The HSEQRS teams in IMCD continuously work to advance procedures and trainings so 
that awareness and up-to-date knowledge of regulatory compliance and export control 
are maintained  in its global organisation. In addition to the principles, instructions and 
prohibitions covered in the Code of Conduct and IMCD Business Principles discussed 
above, a more detailed HSEQR Policy and further screening procedures are in place to 
ensure regulatory compliance.
IMCD's global trade sanctions policy and guideline on restrictive measures and export 
control were updated regularly in 2023 and key employees received refresher training 
on the revisions. In addition, training material on trade sanctions and export control, 
developed by external experts, is available in multiple languages in the courses offered  on 
IMCD's e-learning platform.
The procedures described are used in combination with software that enables sanctions 
screening of business partners. In 2023, a new global risk and compliance screening tool 
was implemented, increasing the number of databases against which IMCD's contacts are 
screened automatically (on a daily basis), and screening on adverse media reports was 
added, which includes a check for (potential) environmental, corruption, and human rights 
related issues.
Compliance training
In 2023, IMCD's global e-learning platform held over 2,300 compliance-related courses 
in over 20 languages, available to all employees worldwide (supporting local compliance 
efforts  and ensuring a better understanding of the material).
In a standardised global compliance training curriculum, the essential pillars of IMCD's 
compliance programme are covered by anti-corruption and bribery, fraud prevention, 
export control and antitrust training material. Local countries can add material on specific  
topics as they see fit. 
The roll-out of the global group compliance training programme was completed in the 
course of 2023. As of 2024, all employees in the IMCD group must complete this 
curriculum (i) during their on-boarding and (ii) at least once every two years by way of 
refresher. A target is set to achieve 100% completions by end of 2024.
Discrimination
In line with GRI requirements, IMCD reports the number of reported discrimination cases. 
As explained in section 2 People and culture, IMCD is an equal opportunity employer and 
has a zero-tolerance approach towards discrimination. This is included in IMCD's Code 
of Conduct, theIMCD Group Human Rights Policy , confirmed  in the IMCD Diversity &

5.2 Cybersecurity
Approach to Cybersecurity
IMCD's IT and cybersecurity approach is aimed at delivering reliable, secure and fit-for-use  
applications, that support IMCD's entrepreneurial spirit and growth as a leading distributor 
of speciality chemicals and ingredients.
Information security organisation and management
In 2019, IMCD established the role of Group Information Security Officer,  who reports 
to the CFO, to lead the continuous process of keeping data collected by IMCD safe. The 
Information Security Officer  oversees the implementation of IMCD's Information Security 
Policy, which provides all group entities with clear guidance on how to gather, store, share 
and protect data. Local implementation is the responsibility of local management and 
supported by dedicated IT staff.  Self-assessments are continuously used and regularly 
renewed by all group entities in order to initiate, where needed, improvement plans that 
meet the Group's minimum requirements. At the Group level, considerable resources are 
dedicated to maintaining and monitoring the IT environment for the purpose of protection 
against cyber threats.
Organisational measures including an ongoing training programme, awareness campaigns, 
phishing tests, identity access management and more are in place to prevent cybersecurity 
risk and create positive impact within IMCD (as mentioned in Risk factors and risk 
management). In addition, multiple layers of technical safeguards and measures have 
been established that are designed to protect against cyber attacks and ensure 
business continuity; these include measures such as network segmentation, multi-factor 
authentication and backups. Penetration tests are performed on a regular basis to monitor 
the level of security. The Internal Audit department is also involved to monitor progress at 
the level of IMCD's local entities.
IT and cybersecurity are discussed annually with the Supervisory Board's Audit Committee. 
In 2023, the annual cybersecurity review took place with the Audit Committee in June, 
during which the Information Security Officer  reported in detail on the actions taken and 
focus areas for further improvements.
Data protection
As part of the Information Security Policy, IMCD has implemented a Data Breach 
Notification  Procedure, enabling early discovery of any incidents and a thorough process 
to quickly and adequately respond to security breaches. This policy was reviewed and 
updated in 2023.
IMCD has established the role of Group Privacy Officer  to oversee any investigation, along 
with a quick response team. The Privacy Officer  is also the first  point of contact in the 
event of any concerns or complaints from either internal or external stakeholders.
Security awareness
In addition to training, a tool to raise awareness and anchor appropriate security 
behaviour in the IMCD culture, a Group-wide Security Awareness Month is held annually 
in October. The focus of the 2023 programme was to educate employees on preventing 
ransom-ware attacks, recognise phishing scams and social engineering and counter 
business e-mail compromise. Examples of cyber fraud attacks commonly encountered in 
IMCD were included in awareness material (for example, CEO-fraud schemes and fake 
customer purchase requests) and best practices were shared around the use of social 
media and emerging technologies.
Our actions to increase security awareness throughout the organisation, combined with 
the multiple layers of technical safeguards and measures, aim for a positive impact on the 
overall (cyber) security of IMCD's IT environment.
5.3 Tax Strategy & Policy provisions
Taxation is a subject of growing interest in the global society of which IMCD is part. IMCD 
pursues a principled and transparent tax strategy that is aligned with organisational values 
and aims to support the overall business strategy and objectives. IMCD sees tax as part of 
its corporate social responsibility. The tax strategy of IMCD also applies in connection with 
IMCD’s employees, customers, self-employed contractors and other (sub)contractors.
IMCD's tax strategy is approved by the Management Board, and reported on to the 
Supervisory Board. Annually, a more in-depth review of the tax strategy and execution

takes place by the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board, with the CFO, Group 
Director Tax & Treasury, in the presence of the external auditor.
The Group reconciles responsible compliance of its tax obligations with its commitments 
of sustainable value creation for its shareholders through efficient  management of tax 
costs and benefits.  Efficient  tax management is based on the support of operational 
activities and development of business models, adhering to both the letter and the spirit of 
applicable laws. Decision making by Tax Management is supported by a careful alignment 
between group departments and local teams taking the company's overall interests into 
consideration and preventing significant  tax risks.
IMCD’s tax principles require compliance with applicable tax rules and regulations in the 
jurisdictions in which IMCD operates. This means that IMCD strives to comply with the 
letter and spirit of the applicable tax laws. Where tax laws do not give clear guidance, 
prudence and transparency are the guiding principles while adhering to IMCD’s Code 
of Conduct. Transfer pricing-related issues are dealt with on an arm’s-length basis in 
accordance with IMCD’s transfer pricing policy, which is consistent with the internationally 
accepted standards of the OECD guidelines for multinational companies.
The Company's genuine commercial activities are leading when setting up international 
structures. Profits  are declared and taxes are paid where the economic activity occurs. Tax 
cost considerations are not the driving force or have a priority over other considerations 
when establishing an (international) structure. Acquisitions are a significant  part of 
IMCD’s business strategy to achieve growth. The different  acquisition structures and tax 
consequences of such transactions are considered and evaluated before carrying out an 
acquisition to minimize the potential tax risks and tax cost.
IMCD sees tax as part of its corporate social responsibility, IMCD’s presence in each 
country is based on genuine commercial activities and IMCD pays its fair share in taxes 
over these activities.
IMCD does not make use of tax havens or non-cooperative jurisdictions to avoid taxes. In 
2023, IMCD is not present in any country listed on the Dutch or EU lists of low taxed states 
and non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax matters, except for the United Arab Emirates 
which is included on the Dutch list. IMCD’s presence in United Arab Emirates is purely 
driven by commercial purposes. IMCD does not obtain any significant  tax benefit  from 
its presence in the United Arab Emirates. On 1 January 2024 the United Arab Emirates is 
removed from the Dutch list.
In accordance with its tax strategy, IMCD takes a conservative approach to tax risks, as it 
does to other risks in the business. Tax risks can arise from unclear laws and regulations as 
well as differences  in interpretation. There is always some level of risk on taxation because 
of the complexity of taxes (including frequent changes in laws), variety and volume of 
different  taxes that affect  the company's business and differences  in the interpretation 
of regulations or at arm’s-length concepts meaning tax authorities may take a different  
view. Tax risks IMCD is exposed to include, among others, acquisition and integration 
risk, non-compliance risk, legislative risk, operational risk, financial  risk and reputation 
risk. To manage its tax risks, the corporate tax department cooperates with all internal 
and external stakeholders to ensure it complies with these regulations with the general 
objective of mitigating these risks while at the same time aiming to be tax-efficient  and, by 
this means, cost-effective. 
Tax risk mitigation is performed by hiring qualified  employees with the required 
experience and knowledge of taxation. Furthermore IMCD is supported by Big 4 
accounting firms  (and in some countries other larger accounting firms)  to support IMCD 
group departments as well as local IMCD entities. In certain cases IMCD works together 
with specialized Law firms  to address specific  tax related questions. With the professional 
support of these firms  we pursue tax risk mitigation by ensuring tax risks are identified  
on an early basis and are properly addressed. IMCD receives tax advisory support for the 
following activities (non-exhaustive): Due Diligence, Integration of companies in the IMCD 
group, transfer pricing, tax structuring and tax compliance. In case any material exposures 
are identified  such risks are escalated within the mechanics of the tax control framework.
IMCD has a tax control framework in place, lastly updated in December 2023, describing 
the tax risks and controls in detail ensuring that the tax risks are known and controlled. 
Potential tax-related risks are assessed by IMCD’s Management Board and discussed 
with the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board to ensure a sustainable and 
viable tax strategy that is compliant with IMCD’s business principles and enhances long-
term profitability. 
IMCD seeks to maintain an open, honest and constructive dialogue with tax authorities 
based on transparency, respect and trust. IMCD is in search of a mutual and reciprocal 
understanding, all with the purpose of ensuring the proper application of the tax 
system, increasing legal security and reducing litigation. Where appropriate IMCD may 
enter into agreements with the tax authorities to ensure upfront clarity and eliminate 
uncertainty about tax implications of certain positions in accordance with the applicable 
legal framework within the jurisdiction and considerate of the international tax landscape.

Integrated Report 2023
IMCD has no agreements in place with tax authorities that secures an outcome that 
could not have been obtained based on a common understanding of applicable law 
and jurisprudence.
In the Netherlands IMCD and the Dutch tax authorities have agreed on an “individual 
supervision plan” for the years 2023 and 2024. By means of this plan the supervision of the 
Dutch tax authorities towards IMCD is defined  by considering the internal governance of 
IMCD, its fiscal  strategy, fiscal  objectives and control measures that are already in place.
IMCD only seeks to apply for government incentives and subsidies to the extent these align 
with the operational nature of the IMCD business, IMCD’s Tax strategy and IMCD's vision of 
health, safety, environmental and quality standards.
Furthermore, IMCD makes benefit  of several Free Trade Zones. The main purpose of 
establishing an IMCD entity in these Free Trade Zones is to avoid double import duties 
when exporting to a country in the region from the entity located in the Free Trade Zone 
or to supply a supplier's customs bonded warehouse. Any corporate income tax benefit  is 
circumstantial and not the intent of the establishment in the Free Trade Zone.
Tax is an integral part of ESG and IMCD’s impact on society and commitment to the 
environment. Tax has both a financial  impact and an impact on climate and society. IMCD 
views tax not only as a risk and cost factor but also as an instrument for long-term value 
creation for the society that IMCD is part of. IMCD applies high standards regarding tax 
transparency, tax compliance and reporting requirements. IMCD does not pay significant  
amounts of sustainability driven taxes such as plastic and sugar tax. As part of the OECD 
country-by-country regulations, IMCD annually files  a country-by-country report with the 
Dutch tax authorities in which it provides on a per-country basis information on matters 
like its taxes paid, accrued corporate income tax, profit  before income tax, accumulated 
earnings and FTE’s. IMCD has a global presence with business activities in more than 
60 countries.
IMCD has a tax policy in place in which IMCD’s view on taxation and the strategy are 
described and in which guidance is given for all tax-related activities that are carried out 
by IMCD's corporate tax team and local finance  teams of the group companies. The tax 
policy provides a framework for distinguishing the corporate tax teams' and local finance  
teams' responsibilities in order to efficiently  manage and control tax risks. For example, 
tax compliance and reporting is managed locally with support and guidance from the 
corporate tax department and external tax counsel and is periodically monitored through 
IMCD's corporate controlling department. The tax policy has been discussed with internal 
stakeholders and is signed off  by the IMCD's Management Board. IMCD's management 
board reviews the tax policy and overall tax strategy on a yearly basis. The tax policy has 
also been shared with IMCD’s external stakeholders such as tax advisors and the Dutch 
tax authorities.
In response to new legislation and tax authorities with enhanced capabilities, IMCD’s tax 
function is designing digital tools. In line with the tax strategy, this will improve efficiency,  
quality and the compliance process.

Alignment with the UN's SDGs
At the end of 2023, IMCD reviewed the alignment of its activities with the 17 Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) formulated by the United Nations. The purpose of this exercise 
was to refresh the analysis of most relevant goals that IMCD can contribute to, influence  
and support. The re-assessment was undertaken by engaging key internal stakeholders 
and forming an SDG committee. The committee members gathered insights and followed 
specific  training on the SDGs. Once the internal knowledge of the SDGs was refined,  
business impacts were assessed during a workshop where the SDG committee gave 
by-proxy insights for IMCD’s stakeholders (customers, principal suppliers, employees 
and investors).
To become more familiar with the SDG goals and their targets, IMCD identified  the ones 
most relevant based on two entry points:
1. Risk to people and the environment – negative impacts
2. Beneficial  products, services or investments – positive impacts
To identify the most relevant goals for IMCD, we used a value chain analysis. In this 
analysis, the SDG committee documented all the inputs and outputs of IMCD along its 
value chain and summarised which stakeholders might be impacted. Once the impacts 
were identified,  the most significant  ones were prioritised and linked to an SDG.
The relevance of the SDGs to IMCD’s context was assessed by prioritising the SDGs, using 
desk research on the material topics shown in IMCD's materiality assessment, the insights 
from the SDG Roadmap for the Chemical Industry and SDG Industry Matrix. To provide 
a comprehensive overview, the SDGs were mapped with the business impacts observed 
across IMCD's entire value chain. Consequently, the resulting figure  illustrates how IMCD 
addresses both positive and negative impacts along its value chain, thereby showcasing its 
alignment with specific  SDGs.
SDGs integrated in IMCD's value creation model
In the process described above, we identified  10 SDGs to which our activities 
contribute with varying intensity. The SDG committee classified  these SDGs into the 
following categories:
• SDGs to which IMCD contributes: These are the SDGs that we actively contribute 
to with our business practices and operations. This involves, for example, our 
efforts  towards occupational health and safety, eco-efficient  operations, sustainable 
procurement, decarbonisation, safe handling and distribution of products, and the 
collaboration on research and knowledge-sharing with principals and customers, 
including on sustainable solutions.
• SDGs which IMCD can influence:  These are the SDGs where IMCD can strive to 
leverage its influence  on (business) partners to drive positive change, or mitigate 
potential negative effects.  Means to influence  partners for example are our efforts  to 
collaborate on and promote formulations with reduced environmental impact together 
with our business partners.
• SDGs IMCD would like to support: These are the Sustainable Development Goals that 
align with our culture, values and long-term vision, but where our current activities may 
not yet have direct involvement or influence. 
By refining  our alignment with the UN's SDGs, and by communicating this alignment 
in our organisation, we strive to enable our teams both locally and on global level, to 
work in a more uniformed and effective  way to make a meaningful contribution to the 
prioritised SDGs.

Integrated Report 2023
8 About this report
Reporting period and frequency
Reporting is conducted annually, with the current report covering the full year of 2023, in 
alignment with the Company's financial  reporting. There is no restatement of information 
for the reporting year 2023.
The Integrated Report has been prepared as IMCD's comprehensive report on both 
Financial and Non-Financial performance as part of the Company's Sustainability Strategy.
All entities included in the Company's consolidated financial  statements or equivalent 
documents are covered by the report unless stated otherwise in the report and/or in the 
Methodology Note annex relevant for disclosure. The report's scope is global with the 
inclusion of all companies included in the Company's consolidated financial  statements. 
Exceptions are relevant for some topics (please see Notes to the Sustainability and 
Financial Statements for more information). A full list of the entities can be found in 
the Company's consolidated financial  statements. The reported data is believed to be 
sufficiently  accurate, balanced, clear, comparable, reliable, and timely.
The report's content is defined  based on the materiality of the most relevant and impactful 
ESG topics for IMCD to manage. Based on the GRI Standards, material topics reflect  IMCD's 
significant  economic, environmental and social impacts and substantively influence  the 
assessments and decisions of stakeholders. All material topics are included in the report. 
By the end of 2021, IMCD refreshed its materiality assessment to define  key focus areas 
for sustainability reporting and to comply with the concept of impact materiality in line 
with the GRI Standards. Therefore, the approach to material topics definition  was changed 
in 2021 (see '2.3 Our Material Topics').
This report has been prepared with reference to the international standards for 
sustainability reporting – the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Universal Standards 2021. 
The GRI framework was used to provide a structured presentation of this content. A GRI 
Content Index contrasts the GRI disclosures with the corresponding passages in the report.
With the support of the Management Board, it is the Company's policy to seek review 
of its sustainability reporting by external independent parties. This report has therefore 
completed the external assurance procedure implemented by Deloitte Accountants B.V. a 
limited assurance level.
For questions about the report or reported information, our contact details are specified  
in this report's Colophon and our website Contact us | IMCD (imcdgroup.com).

Integrated Report 2023
1 EU Taxonomy
Introduction and objective
The EU Taxonomy Regulation (EU 2020/852) that 
entered into force on 12 July 2020 is a classification  
system establishing a list of environmentally sustainable 
economic activities. The aim is to scale up sustainable 
investments by providing a common European definition  
of what is a 'sustainable activity'.
The applicable Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 
2021/2139 of 4 June 2021 (“Climate Delegated Act”) 
covers sustainable activities for climate change mitigation 
('CCM') and climate change adaptation ('CCA') objectives 
of the EU Taxonomy. This Climate Delegated Act was 
modified  by the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 
2023/2485 of 27 June 2023 to include new activities. 
In addition, the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 
2023/2486 of 27 June 2023 (“Environmental Delegated 
Act”) covers sustainable activities for the remaining 
four environmental objectives of the EU Taxonomy 
which are sustainable use and protection of water and 
marine resources, the transition to a circular economy, 
pollution prevention and control, and the protection and 
restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.
In 2023, companies falling under the scope of the 
EU NFRD (Directive 2014/95/EU), which is the case for 
IMCD, shall report the eligible share of activities for 
all 6 environmental objectives, and the aligned share 
of activities for the climate objectives (CCM & CCA) 
to the EU Taxonomy. An activity is ‘Taxonomy-aligned’ 
when it makes a substantial contribution to at least one 
environmental objective, meets the technical screening 
criteria and the 'do no significant  harm' principle (DNSH).
Eligibility and alignment assessment 
based on the Climate Delegated Act and 
Environmental Delegated Act
IMCD distinguishes four main economic activities.
• Sales & marketing of speciality chemicals 
and ingredients
• Product analysis and development
• Product manufacturing, and
• Customer, supplier, and employee development 
services (seminars, workshops and training 
sessions)                   .
The economic activity of “Sales & marketing of speciality 
chemicals and ingredients” is not included in any of 
the annexes of the EU Taxonomy. The economic activity 
of “Product manufacturing” entails only a certain set of 
chemical products for Annex I and II of the Climate 
Delegated Act, none of which IMCD produces. This means 
that all turnover linked to these two activities is non-
eligible for the EU Taxonomy.
IMCD’s two remaining activities, “Product analysis and 
development”, and “Customer, supplier and employee 
development services” could not be paired with activities 
in the Taxonomy.
With regards to the activity of ‘Product analysis and 
development,’ we analysed a link with our Sustainable 
Solutions Program. This is a programme that has the 
potential to be covered by all six of the environmental 
objectives of the EU Taxonomy. At this point in time, 
however, it is not possible for us to extract any 
separate turnover, CapEx, or OpEx linked to the activity 
‘Product analysis and development’ or the Sustainable 
Solutions program.
For the activity of ‘Customer, supplier and employee 
development services’ IMCD concludes that the service it 
provides for its client does not fall under the description 
as provided by the EU Taxonomy for the activity 
‘Education’ of climate change adaptation. IMCD’s economic 
activity is aimed at, a.o., new product development in 
collaboration with our customers' R&D departments, 
facilitating customers to test product performance, 
internal training, and explaining the products to the client, 
which is in the core of every business. In our reading of 
the Taxonomy this activity does not explicitly make it to be 
an educational activity. Considering the NACE-code linked 
to the activity (P85), IMCD’s activity does not seem to be 
included there.
Hence, also for the economic activities of “Customer, 
supplier and employee development services”, and 
“Product analysis and development”, no eligible turnover 
could be identified. 
Since IMCD does not have any eligible turnover for any of 
the six environmental objectives of the EU Taxonomy we 
cannot claim any eligible CapEx or OpEx associated with 
any eligible turnover. IMCD also does not have a CapEx 
plan in place to expand Taxonomy-aligned economic 
activities or to allow Taxonomy-eligible economic activities 
to become Taxonomy-aligned. IMCD does, however, have 
CapEx and OpEx related to the purchase of output from 
Taxonomy-aligned economic activities. More specifically  
IMCD has identified  eligible CapEx and OpEx linked to the 
purchases of output of Taxonomy activities:

The purchase of output from Taxonomy-aligned economic 
activities is determined within the scope of CapEx and 
OpEx under the EU Taxonomy regulation. In total, 22% of 
IMCD’s CapEx in 2023 is deemed to be eligible for the EU 
Taxonomy, and 27% of IMCD’s OpEx in 2023 is considered 
as eligible according the EU Taxonomy.
Since none of the activities of IMCD is deemed eligible, 
and IMCD does not yet have the information on the 
Taxonomy alignment of the output purchased from 
Taxonomy activities, IMCD cannot claim to have any 
aligned turnover, CapEx or OpEx in this reporting year. 
IMCD will reassess potential alignment for all three KPIs 
on an annual basis.
In the following tables the eligible revenue, CapEx and 
OpEx amounts and percentages are presented.

Qualitative information referred to in the 
Disclosures Delegated Act (Section 1.2 of 
Annex I)
IMCD intends to be fully transparent on its approach 
with regard to the EU Taxonomy, in the qualitative 
information accompanying its disclosures on revenue, 
CapEx, and OpEx.
Accounting policy
For the revenue, the numerator of each of the above-
mentioned activities was compiled by taking the total 
eligible revenue for that activity for the reporting year 
2023. The total denominator was equal to revenue 
of the economic activities "Sales & marketing of 
speciality chemicals and ingredients, Product analysis and 
development , Product manufacturing, and, Customer, 
supplier, and employee development services (seminars, 
workshops and training sessions)" mentioned above. 
Please refer to the Note 8 to the Consolidated financial  
statements 2023 for further disclosure on revenue.
For the CapEx, the numerator was compiled by taking 
the total eligible CapEx for the reporting year 2023. This 
is the CapEx that is related to the purchase of output 
from Taxonomy-aligned economic activities and individual 
measures enabling the target activities to become low-
carbon or to lead to greenhouse gas reductions, notably 
the activities 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 7.1, 7.2, 7.4, 7.5 , 7.6 and 7.7.
For the CapEx, the total denominator (EUR 265.6 million) 
covers additions to tangible assets (EUR 31.7 million), 
right-of-use assets (EUR 45.3 million) and intangible 
assets (EUR 188.6 million) during the financial  year 
considered before depreciation, amortisation and 
any re-measurements, including those resulting from 
revaluations and impairments and resulting from business 
combinations, for the relevant financial  year and excluding 
fair value changes. Reference is made to notes 17 
Property, plant and equipment, 18 Intangible assets and 
19 Leases.
For the OpEx, the numerator (EUR 1.2 million) was 
compiled by taking the total eligible OpEx for 2023. This 
is the OpEx that relates to the purchase of output from 
Taxonomy-aligned economic activities and to individual 
measures enabling the target activities to become low-
carbon or to lead to greenhouse gas reductions as well 
as individual building renovation measures as identified  
in the delegated acts adopted pursuant to Article 10(3), 
Article 11(3), Article 12(2), Article 13(2), Article 14(2) or 
Article 15(2) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and provided 
that such measures are implemented and operational 
within 18 months.
The OpEx, the total denominator (EUR 4.5 million) includes 
costs relating to short-term leases (EUR 2.3 million), 
maintenance (EUR 1.1) and any other direct expenditures 
relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of property, 
plant and equipment both by IMCD itself or any third 
party linked to the operations (EUR 1.0 million).
Assessment of compliance with Regulation 
(EU) 2020/852
In our assessment of the eligibility of our business 
activities, we applied the definitions  included in the 
Delegated Acts published by the European Commission on 
9 December 2021 (Climate Delegated Act), 10 December 
2021 (Disclosures Delegated Act) and 23 November 2023 
(Environmental Delegated Act), applicable to all companies 
falling under the NFRD as of 1 January 2022.
A precise definition  is provided for each activity included 
in the EU Taxonomy, that describes the economic 
activities that fall within the scope of this precise EU 
Taxonomy-eligible activity. We have acted in good faith 
and have rigorously followed the scope set out in the 
definitions.  We have also considered further guidance of 
the EU in FAQs and other official  policy documents to 
reach our conclusions.
We have not included any activities as eligible if they were 
not deemed to fall within scope of these definitions.  If 
in the future doubts should arise, or new insights should 
teach us that any of our activities were eligible, we will 
include these activities in our Taxonomy disclosures in 
future reporting years.

2 Recommendations of the Task force on Climate related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD)
Introduction
Our approach to climate change responds to the global 
challenges for our planet and society as a whole and 
is embedded in IMCD's business model. It tackles the 
most material topics to our business and our stakeholders 
and translates our overall sustainability efforts  into 
tangible goals.
In 2023, IMCD has further strengthened its sustainability 
approach by improving its alignment to the 
Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD) recommendations. IMCD has carried out an 
in-depth assessment of its alignment to the eleven 
recommendations and has utilised a qualitative scenario-
based approach to assess the impact of physical and 
transition risks and opportunities. This work has formed 
the basis of IMCD’s 2022 TCFD Disclosure, for each pillar 
of Governance, Strategy, Risk Management and Metrics 
and Targets. IMCD is in the process of developing a TCFD 
roadmap, which will lay out its plan for further integrating 
the TCFD recommendations in IMCD's business strategy 
and financial  planning.
Governance
Board’s oversight of climate-related risks 
and opportunities
IMCD has three levels of corporate governance; the 
Supervisory Board monitors and supervises the activities 
of the Management Board and IMCD's general course 
of business, IMCD’s Management Board manages IMCD's 
day-to-day operations and is responsible for designing 
and achieving the company's objectives and strategy, 
and the Executive Committee supports the Management 
Board. Climate-related topics are addressed alongside 
IMCD’s other sustainability topics and mostly from an 
inside-out perspective, i.e., IMCD’s strategy to reduce its 
impact on climate. As we develop our understanding of 
climate-related risks and opportunities from an outside-
in perspective, we will consider whether governance 
structures require updating.
IMCD’s Supervisory Board oversees, monitors, and advises 
IMCD’s Management Board on climate-related issues 
that are relevant to the business. Both governing 
bodies review sustainability topics and their impacts, 
risks, and opportunities at least annually, as well as 
in case of specific  concerns. In 2022, the Supervisory 
Board discussed IMCD's strategic update for Health, 
Safety, Environment, Quality and Regulatory (HSEQR) and 
Sustainability with the Director HSEQR and Sustainability.
The Supervisory Board has three committees, the 
Audit Committee (AC), Remuneration Committee (RC) 
and Nomination and Appointment Committee (NAC). 
Sustainability issues are considered by these committees 
where relevant to their responsibilities, although this 
considers sustainability holistically, not in specific  
reference to climate-related issues. For example, in 
2022, a session was held to discuss in more detail 
the sustainability data collection process, ESG target 
setting and reporting requirements, in which the Group 
Director HSEQR and Sustainability, the Director Corporate 
Control and Group Compliance Officer  participated. 
The RC is responsible for assessing and preparing 
the remuneration policy and remuneration proposals 
concerning the members of the Management Board 
and the Supervisory Board, including how sustainability 
performance is included in remuneration decisions. Part 
of the personal bonus KPIs of the Management Board 
members was connected to climate-related metrics, 
including performance against IMCD's ambition to achieve 
a 15% reduction in emissions intensity by 2024, compared 
to the baseline year 2019.
Management role in assessing and managing 
climate-related risks and opportunities.
IMCD's sustainability strategy is determined by its 
Management Board and Executive Committee. A 
member of the Executive Committee, has been 
assigned climate-related responsibility and reports 
to the Management Board. The Supervisory Board 
supervises the organisation's climate strategy and climate-
related issues.
A member of the Executive Committee chairs the 
Sustainability Task Force and directly reports to the 
Management Board. The members of the Sustainability 
Task Force are functional leaders who work in alignment 
to assure sustainability integration in all areas of our 
business and who advise the Management Board. Key 
sustainability topics including climate-related issues are 
identified  in consultation with external and internal 
stakeholders, assessed by the Management Board, and 
are monitored at group level by the Sustainability Task 
Force. Climate-related topics discussed by the Task Force 
include the collection of sustainability and climate-related

and setting new emissions reduction targets. The day-to-
day sustainability aspects of IMCD's operational activities 
are managed by the Business Groups and the countries.
Climate Strategy
Short, medium, and long term climate-related 
risks and opportunities
Climate-related physical and transition risks were 
identified  over short, medium, and long-term time 
horizons using scenario analysis. This process is described 
in detail in the section Strategy c) with IMCD’s potentially 
material risks described in the table with climate-related 
risks and opportunities.
Potential materiality considers both IMCD's exposure, 
defined  using our risk management framework definition  
of impact, and changes in scenario data. It is a qualitative 
assessment of materiality only.
The impact of climate-related risks and 
opportunities on the organisation's businesses, 
strategy, and financial planning
Climate-related risks and opportunities have been 
considered in IMCD’s strategy and financial  planning 
to minimise potential risks and maximise opportunities. 
Next year, IMCD will look to use the results from 
the qualitative scenario analysis exercise to adjust its 
strategy and financial  planning where necessary. IMCD’s 
strategy has already considered climate-related issues, 
specifically  regarding:
• Sustainable solutions – The Sustainable Solutions 
Framework Programme is IMCD’s market-oriented 
programme to promote greener products throughout 
its supply chain. The programme leverages IMCD's 
market intelligence, technical expertise, extensive 
laboratory infrastructure, and product knowledge to 
create a comprehensive green products catalogue. For 
more information about Sustainable Solutions, see 
section Sustainable Solutions (see page 66).
• Supply chain decarbonisation – IMCD launched its 
Supply Chain Decarbonisation Programme in 2022 
with the aim of reducing GHG emissions across 
the supply chain. In close cooperation with our 
logistics service providers, we strive to reduce carbon 
emissions through efficient  routing, optimisation of 
the volume-mileage ratio and implementation of 
sustainable transport modes. In 2022, IMCD developed 
the CO2 dashboard to provide real-time insight into 
the carbon footprint of our third-party logistics 
providers (3PLs). For more information about our 
supply chain decarbonisation work, see section Eco- 
efficient  operations (see page 28).
• Eco-efficient  operations – IMCD's direct 
environmental footprint is limited given its asset-light 
business model. Nevertheless, reducing its overall 
operational footprint on the environment is critical 
for IMCD and its stakeholders. For more information 
about how we are reducing operational emissions, see 
section Eco-efficient  operations (see page 28).
Several financial  planning elements have been influenced  
by climate-related issues.
In our commercial and financial  forecast and budget 
process, we make projections of future sales volumes 
and margins based on the expected macroeconomic 
and microeconomic market conditions. In addition trends 
in customer demands, our principal's product and 
market strategies and expected product availability are 
considered as well.
Due to our asset-light business model, the impacts of 
climate related issues on capital expenditures (Capex) 
are relatively low . IMCD's CapEx mainly relates to 
improvements to the offices  and warehouses, including 
energy saving measures and the new right-of-use assets 
related to hybrid and full electric company cars and more 
energy efficient  office  and warehouse locations.
With regard to operating expenses (OPEX), in 
particular the consequence of moving offices  to more 
energy efficient  locations is incorporated into our 
financial  planning.
IMCD's strategy, taking into consideration 
different climate related scenarios, including a 
2°C or lower scenario
To improve understanding of IMCD’s resilience to the 
impacts of climate change, the company has worked 
with a reputable global sustainability consultancy firm  to 
carry out an assessment of its exposure to physical and 
transition risks and opportunities, using scenario analysis. 
The results from the scenario analysis, as articulated 
below, demonstrated that IMCD is exposed more to 
transition risks and opportunities than to physical risks. 
In a net-zero scenario, the analysis showed that IMCD’s 
strategy is resilient overall to the associated changes 
in policy, technology, and markets. However, there are 
several high risks and high opportunities that we will aim 
to mitigate or maximise.
From a physical risk perspective, only a small proportion 
of assets and supplier locations were included in the 
analysis and although physical risks were limited in 
these locations, a wider assessment including additional 
locations is required to form a more complete picture of 
our resilience.
Scenario Analysis Methodology
Aligned with TCFD guidance, IMCD has assessed risks 
and opportunities on a short (2027 and 2030), medium 
(2040), and long-term (2050) basis. These time horizons 
align with shorter-term strategy planning cycles as well as 
international and national climate policy milestones such

as the European Union’s 2050 climate-neutral target, and 
the expected lifetime of our assets.
The scenario analysis commenced with a process of 
identifying relevant physical and transition risks and 
opportunities that could have a potential impact on our 
business, aligned to the TCFD’s taxonomy of physical 
and transition risks and opportunities. Each risk and 
opportunity was qualitatively assessed using impact and 
uncertainty ratings and validated with a wide range 
of stakeholders representing different  IMCD Business 
Groups and functions. Impact ratings were assigned using 
the same categorisations as applied in our enterprise 
risk management framework. As climate scenarios are 
inherently uncertain, the scenario analysis considered the 
full range of potential impacts from all scenarios, without 
considering the likelihood of each scenario developing. 
We considered the uncertainty associated with each item, 
recognising that items that could have a high impact and 
high uncertainty should be explored further.
All nine physical climate hazards covering both acute and 
chronic physical risks were taken forward to the scenario 
analysis assessment, while the top eight transition risks 
and opportunities were prioritised based on the impact-
uncertainty rating for a deeper dive using scenario 
analysis. Physical and transition scenarios were selected 
for the analysis and are described in the following table.
TYPE SCENARIO 2100 WARMING DESCRIPTION
Physical IPCC SSP1-2.6 +1.8°C This scenario is aligned to the current commitments under the Paris Agreement. The world shifts towards a more sustainable 
path, emphasising more inclusive development, driven by an increasing commitment to achieving development goals. Physical 
climate risks are more limited.
IPCC SSP5-8.5 +4.4°C This is a high-emissions scenario with no additional climate policy (business-as-usual). The push for economic and social 
development is coupled with the exploitation of abundant fossil fuel resources and the adoption of resource and energy 
intensive lifestyles around the world. Physical climate risks increase.
Transition IEA Stated Policies +2.6°C This scenario assumes that only currently implemented policies are preserved, with an expected temperature outcome of 
~2.6°C. The scenario explores how the energy system may change without major changes from policy makers. It does not take 
for granted that countries will achieve announced goals.
IEA Net Zero by 2050 +1.4°C This is an ambitious scenario that limits global warming to 1.5 °C through stringent climate policies and innovation, reaching 
net-zero CO2 emissions around 2050. It represents one potential path to achieve Net Zero and assumes an orderly transition 
across the energy sector.
Physical risks were assessed for ten IMCD asset locations, which were selected to represent different  geographical locations IMCD operates in and based on the net inventory value. For 
each prioritised item, a scenario indicator was assigned, acting as a proxy to explore how the trend of exposure to the risk or opportunity may develop in each scenario. These were 
combined with exposure ratings, derived from the assigned impact rating, to give an overall risk/opportunity rating at each time frame. Potential materiality is therefore derived from the 
risks that IMCD is most exposed to, and the risks that are likely to change most in each scenario compared to a baseline level. Items rated a high risk/opportunity at any time frame are 
disclosed and described in the following table.

ITEM TCFD CATEGORY DESCRIPTION POTENTIAL FINANCIAL IMPACT QUALITATIVE RATING
Short Medium Long
Reduced demand 
for higher 
carbon products
Market Several IMCD end-user markets may face changing demand in a 
net-zero scenario which could impact demand for IMCD products 
supplying these sectors. For example, the Lubricants & Energy 
business group supplies a range of speciality chemicals across oil, 
gas, and fuel markets, which may shrink in a transition to net zero .
Decreased revenue Low risk High risk High 
risk
Supplier inability 
to meet increased 
demand for low-
carbon products
Market The demand for low-carbon products is projected to increase in 
a net-zero scenario, driven by policy and regulatory changes and 
changes in consumer preferences. As a distributor of goods, IMCD 
is reliant on suppliers to be able to provide low-carbon products. 
Suppliers may not decarbonise in line with expectations, which could 
limit IMCD’s supplier choice for low-carbon products.
Decreased revenue Low risk High risk High 
risk
Rising logistics costs Market In a net-zero scenario, the transport sector faces a significant  
challenge to decarbonise in line with net-zero requirements. The 
investment cost to decarbonise fleets,  e.g., replacement of internal 
combustion engine (ICE) fleets  to low carbon/ electric fleets,  could be 
passed on to IMCD, leading to higher transportation costs of IMCD 
products. As the majority of our transportation is through third-party 
logistics providers, IMCD could be highly exposed to this risk .
Increased indirect costs Low risk High risk High 
risk
Access to new markets 
that align to the 
energy transition
Market The achievement of net-zero will require new technologies, which 
could drive demand for products in new markets. Examples of these 
markets include hydrogen, renewable electricity generation, and 
biofuels. By adapting its product and supplier portfolio, IMCD is well 
placed to take advantage of these growing markets.
Increased revenue Moderate 
Opportunity
High opportunity High 
opportunity
Proactive management 
of product portfolio
Market As the demand for low-carbon products in current markets 
increases, IMCD can proactively seek partnerships with suppliers 
who are accelerating their net-zero ambitions. Consumer facing 
sectors are already increasing demand for low-carbon chemical 
products with many companies setting net-zero targets for their 
whole supply chain. Achievement of these targets will rely on the 
availability of low-carbon input materials, leading to an opportunity 
for IMCD.
Increased revenue Moderate 
Opportunity
High opportunity High

Coastal and Extreme 
Rainfall Flooding 
impact on operations
Acute physical Under rising temperatures, the atmosphere warms, which increases 
the amount of moisture that can be held. More moisture can 
lead to more rainfall in short, and intense downpours, which can 
increase the risk of extreme rainfall and (flash)  flooding.  Under rising 
temperatures, sea-levels can also rise, therefore increasing the risk 
of storm surges and coastal flooding  of low-lying land. Two IMCD 
assets , one in Brazil and one in the Netherlands, could potentially 
face a significant  risk of flooding  in the assessed scenarios.

Risk Management
Identification of and assessment of climate-
related risks and opportunities
IMCD's risk management policy is aimed at striking 
the best balance between maximisation of business 
opportunities in the context of the company's strategy, 
and managing the risks involved. In 2021, Corporate 
Control in cooperation with Internal Audit completely 
reworked the IMCD risk and control framework fusing a 
bottom-up approach. Climate-related risks were identified  
within this framework, ensuring a consistent approach to 
enterprise-level risks across the business.
In 2023, IMCD completed a scenario analysis project, as 
described in the Strategy section above. It considered 
a wider range of physical and transition risks over 
longer time horizons than used in our risk management 
policy and explored how these risks could develop if 
different  scenarios were to play out. In the next year, 
IMCD will explore how the outcomes of this assessment 
can be further integrated into the organisation’s risk 
management framework.
IMCD’s risk framework integrates climate-related risks 
in three stages: risk identification,  risk assessment 
and management of risks: Risk Identification  Risks 
are identified  by using external sources, internal risk 
documents, and through risk interviews and risk 
workshops with senior (country and departmental) 
management, Executive Committee, Management Board, 
and others within the Company and through online 
surveys. In 2022, this included identifying climate change-
related risks and the impact of future regulations with 
regard to climate change.
Risk Assessment Risks are grouped into four categories; 
strategic, operational, financial,  and compliance, and are 
assessed based on likelihood and impact ratings, over 
a three-year time period. Impact and likelihood are 
plotted on a risk matrix, which consists of five  levels of 
likelihood (remote, unlikely, possible, likely, and probable) 
and five  levels of impact (minor, moderate, severe, and 
extreme). Risks are assessed on an inherent and residual 
basis. Climate-related risks are assessed against the same 
likelihood and impact criteria as other enterprise risks.
Management of climate-related risks
After determining the residual risk level, senior 
management and Corporate Control verify whether this 
is within the boundaries of the risk appetite established 
for each risk category. Operational risks have a ‘low’ risk 
appetite, meaning that the Company seeks to minimise 
the risks of unforeseen operational failures within its 
businesses. The residual risks are treated as follows:
• Accept - Awareness of the risk level and willing to 
accept the consequences, assuming that designed 
controls are operating effectively. 
• Mitigate - Implementing new or revised controls or 
taking specific  action to reduce residual risk .
• Avoid - Ending the activities causing the risk.
• Transfer - Transferring the risk to another party (e.g., 
insurance company).
New or revised controls to mitigate an undesired residual 
risk level are documented in the Risk and Control 
Framework. Management of the IMCD group entities 
is instructed to implement such controls and realistic 
deadlines are set for the implementation. Accepted 
residual risks may remain after additional controls have 
been designed and implemented. We will consider 
whether further management measures are required for 
the climate-related risks and opportunities identified  as 
being potentially material in the scenario analysis project 
as we integrate findings  into our ERM process.
Identifying, assessing, and managing climate-
related risks are integrated into the 
organisation’s overall risk management
As described above, we considered climate change in the 
identification,  assessment, and management of climate-
related risks for the first  time in 2022 and evaluated these 
during 2023. The outcomes of the risk assessment are 
shown in the following table.
CATEGORY RISK IMPACT LIKELIHOOD RISK APPETITE RISK RESPONSE
Operational Climate change Moderate Low Low Potential climate hazards are considered in the selection process of logistics service 
providers, and warehouse, laboratory and office  locations, addressing accessibility 
and back-up procedures in the event of environmental incidents.

Metrics and Targets
Metrics to assess climate-related risks 
and opportunities
The main metrics IMCD uses to monitor climate change 
risks and opportunities are GHG emissions metrics, 
including emissions from Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 
3 – third-party logistics. We will consider whether to 
develop new metrics used to monitor and manage 
potentially material climate-related risks identified  in the 
2023 scenario analysis.
Climate-related metrics are incorporated in IMCD 
remuneration policies. In 2023, non-financial  targets had 
a 30% weighting for the short-term incentive for the 
Management Board. Three non-financial  topics were 
selected for 2023: social/ employee engagement, diversity, 
and sustainability. Sustainability-related performance 
indicators were set for three topics: emissions reduction, 
supply chain management and sustainable procurement.
Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions, and the related risks.
IMCD measures and monitors Scope 1, Scope 2, 
Scope 3 upstream and downstream transportation and 
distribution GHG emissions, calculated in line with the 
GHG Protocol. For more information on our performance 
to date against these metrics and methodology, see Note 
3.1 in the Notes to the Sustainability statements.
Targets used by the organisation to manage 
climate-related risks and opportunities and 
performance against targets
In 2019, IMCD set a target to deliver a 15% reduction in 
its GHG emissions per million euro operating EBITDA by 
2024, compared to the 2019 baseline. This includes our 
Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 – third-party logistics GHG 
emissions. For a breakdown of our emissions metrics, 
and current performance against this target, please see 
section Energy and emissions management and and the 
methodology note (see Note 3.1 in the Notes to the 
Sustainability statement) . We will work to develop targets 
aligned to the potentially material climate-related risks 
and opportunities identified  in scenario analysis in the 
coming years.
Next steps & Conclusion
At present, the goals for 2024 seek to:
• Further develop our understanding of Scope 
3 emissions to optimise our supply chain 
decarbonisation strategy.
• Enhance climate governance within the organisation to 
ensure climate is a major and regular consideration 
for the Board and executive leadership across 
the business.
• Continue to embed climate into the business 
strategy, with particular emphasis on financial  planning 
and resilience.
• Integrate physical and transition risks and 
opportunities into risk management frameworks 
alongside business risks.
• Form metrics to manage and targets to monitor these 
climate-related risks and opportunities.
• Continue to analyse and monitor the impact of physical 
climate risks on IMCD’s supply chain.
• Establish a transition plan that describes IMCD’s 
targets, actions, and financial  plans to transition to a 
low-carbon economy.
Whilst IMCD has made significant  progress this 
financial  year in its TCFD reporting and alignment, the 
organisation has the ambition to further integrate the 
recommendations of the TCFD. IMCD aims to develop a 
roadmap to clearly define  the future expectations of the 
business so as to continue to develop its approach to 
managing climate change issues.

Notes to the Consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2023
1 Reporting entity
IMCD N.V. (the ‘Company’) is a public limited company domiciled in the Netherlands 
and registered in The Netherlands Chamber of Commerce Commercial register under 
number 21740070. The address of the Company’s registered office  is Wilhelminaplein 32, 
Rotterdam. The consolidated financial  statements of the Company as at and for the year 
ended 31 December 2023 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to 
as the ‘Group’ and individually as ‘Group entities’). The Company is acting as the parent 
company of the IMCD Group, a group of leading companies in sales, marketing and 
distribution of speciality chemicals and pharmaceutical and food ingredients.The Group 
has offices  and warehouses in Europe, Asia-Pacific,  Africa, and in North and Latin America.
2 Basis of preparation
2.a Statement of compliance
The consolidated financial  statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and 
with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code.
The consolidated financial  statements were authorised for publication by all members of 
the Management Board and the Supervisory Board on 29 February 2024.
2.b Basis of measurement
The consolidated financial  statements are prepared on a going concern 
basis and on the historical cost principle, except for the following 
material items in the statement of financial  position:
• derivative financial  instruments are measured at fair value
• non-derivative financial  instruments at fair value 
through profit  or loss are measured at fair value
• contingent considerations assumed in a business combination are 
measured at fair value
• the defined  benefit  asset/liability is recognised as the net total of the plan assets, less 
the present value of the defined  benefit  obligation and is adjusted for any effect  of the 
asset ceiling
2.c Functional and presentation currency
These consolidated financial  statements are presented in EUR, which is the Company's 
functional currency. All financial  information presented in this report in EUR has been 
rounded to the nearest thousand, unless stated otherwise.
2.d Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial  statements in conformity with 
IFRS  requires management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect  the application of 
accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, 
liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ  from these estimates.
In preparing the consolidated financial  statements, management considered its climate 
change and sustainability ambitions. In light of this, management reviewed the material 
accounting estimates and judgments. This review did not lead to significant  changes in 
these accounting estimates and judgments.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to 
accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and 
in any future periods affected. 
Judgements
Information about judgements made in applying accounting policies that have the most 
material effect  on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial  statements are 
included in the following notes:
• Notes  7 , 28 and 35: whether the Group has (de facto) control over an investee and 
whether a non-controlling interest is recognised.
• Note 19 – lease term: whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise 
extension options
Assumptions and estimation uncertainties
Information about assumptions and estimation 
uncertainties that bear a significant  risk of resulting in a material 
adjustment in the financial  year are included in the following notes:
• Note 7 – acquisition of subsidiaries: fair value measured on a provisional basis

Measurement of fair values
A number of the Group’s accounting policies and 
disclosures require  measurement of fair values for both financial  and non-financial  assets 
and liabilities.
The Group has a structured control framework in place 
with respect to the measurement of fair values. This includes a 
dedicated team that has responsibility for overseeing all significant  fair value 
measurements, including Level 3 fair values, which reports directly to the CFO.
Management regularly reviews significant  unobservable 
inputs and valuation adjustments. If third-party information, such as broker quotes 
or pricing services, is used to measure fair values, then management 
assesses the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the 
conclusion that such valuations meet IFRS requirements, including the level in the fair 
value hierarchy in which such valuations should be classified. 
When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, 
the Group uses market observable data as far as possible. 
Fair values are categorised into different  levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs 
used in the valuation techniques as follows:
• level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
• level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in 
Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, 
either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices)
• level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not 
based on observable market data (unobservable inputs)
If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or 
a liability might be categorised in different  levels of the fair 
value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same 
level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant  to the 
entire measurement.
The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end 
of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.
Further information about the assumptions made in 
measuring fair values is included in the following notes:
• Note 7: acquisition of subsidiaries
• Note 12: share-based payment arrangements
• Note 30: employee benefits 
• Note 33: financial  instruments
2.e Changes in accounting policies
The Group has consistently applied the accounting policies set out in Note 3 to all 
periods presented in these consolidated financial  statements.

Integrated Report 2023
The Group has adopted the Amendments to IAS 12 as released by the IASB in May 2023 
on the temporary exception from the accounting requirements for deferred taxes that 
arises from Pillar Two legislation. As a result, the Group neither recognizes nor discloses 
information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes.
The Pillar Two Rules have been (substantively) enacted per 19 December 2023 in the 
Netherlands, following the implementation of the EU Pillar 2 Directive (‘’Pillar Two Rules’’). 
As the Group falls within the scope of the Pillar Two Rules, it will impact financial  years 
of the Group as of 1 January 2024. Since the Pillar Two legislation was not effective  at the 
reporting date, the Group has no related current tax exposure.
The Pillar Two Rules effectuate  that the Group will pay tax on its profits  at an effective  rate 
of at least 15% at jurisdictional level. For the jurisdictions where the Group has an effective  
tax rate which is less than 15%, the ultimate parent company, situated in the Netherlands, 
will be required to pay top-up tax on the profits. 
The Group is in the process of assessing its exposure to Pillar Two legislation for when it 
comes into effect.  Following the Group’s assessment on the impact of the Pillar Two Rules 
via the application of the temporary CbCR Safe Harbour Rules, there is one jurisdiction 
of the Group that is expected to be exposed to top-up tax in the foreseeable future. The 
top-up tax for this jurisdiction is however not expected to have a material tax impact 
on the Group. For the other jurisdictions wherein the Group is active, at least one of 
the temporary CbCR Safe Harbour Rules is expected to apply, due to which top-up tax on 
profits  of the entities situated in these jurisdictions is deemed to be zero. As such, the 
overall Pillar Two impact for the Group is not expected to be material.
Due to complexities in applying the legislation and calculating the effective  tax rate for 
Pillar Two purposes, it is difficult  at this stage to make a definite  quantitative impact 
assessment. The Group is however assessing the Pillar Two impact on an ongoing basis, 
following both current and future financial  results.
New standards and amendments not yet effective
Below the standards and amendments that are issued, but not yet effective  as of 
31 December 2023. The Group intends to adopt these standards and amendments, if 
applicable, when they become effective: 
• Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements - Classification  of Liabilities 
as Current or Non-current and Non-current Liabilities with Covenants, applicable for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024, but not yet endorsed in the EU;
• Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases - Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback, effective  
1 January 2024;
• Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: - 
Disclosures: Supplier Finance Arrangements, applicable for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2024, but not yet endorsed in the EU;
• Amendments to IAS 21 The Effects  of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates -Lack of 
Exchangeability, applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2025, but 
not yet endorsed in the EU.
The Group is reviewing the impact of these standards and amendments on the Group's 
consolidated financial  statements. The changes to those standads are not expected to 
have a material impact on the Group's financial  statements.

3 Material accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods 
presented in these consolidated financial  statements.
3.a Basis of consolidation
Business combinations
The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when control 
is transferred to the Group. The consideration transferred in the acquisition is generally 
measured at fair value, as are the identifiable  net assets acquired. An exception on 
this are deferred tax assets or liabilities and assets or liabilities related to employee 
benefit  arrangements which are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 
Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits  respectively. Any goodwill that arises is tested 
annually for impairment. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in profit  or loss 
immediately. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of 
debt or equity securities.
Any contingent consideration payable is initially measured at fair value at the acquisition 
date. If contingent consideration is initially classified  as equity, then the amount payable 
is not remeasured and the related settlement is accounted for as a change in equity. 
Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are 
recognised in profit  or loss as finance  income or costs. Upon exercising of any related 
call and put option, changes in the fair value are recognised as a change in equity.
Written put options to acquire a non-controlling interest are accounted for by the 
anticipated-acquisition method. The fair value of the consideration payable is included in 
financial  liabilities; future changes in the carrying value of the put option are recognised in 
profit  or loss throughout the reporting periods. Any change in carrying value at settlement 
date compared to the previous reporting period is recognised within equity as transaction 
between equity holders.
The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:
• the fair value of the consideration transferred
• plus the recognised amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree
• plus, if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the pre-existing 
equity interest in the acquiree
• less the net recognised amount (at fair value) of the identifiable  assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the 
reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts 
for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are 
adjusted during the measurement period, or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, 
to reflect  new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of 
the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected  the amounts recognised as at 
that date.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it 
is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and 
has the ability to affect  those returns through its power over the entity. The financial  
statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial  statements from the 
date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Interests in equity-accounted investees
The Group’s interests in equity-accounted investees comprise interests in associates. 
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant  influence,  but no control 
over the financial  and operating policies.
Interests in associates are accounted for using the equity method. They are recognised 
initially at cost, which includes transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the 
consolidated financial  statements include the Group’s share of the profit  or loss and OCI of 
equity-accounted investees, until the date on which significant  influence  ceases.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising 
from intra-group transactions, are eliminated when preparing the consolidated financial  
statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees 
are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. 
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the 
extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
3.b Foreign currency
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies 
of Group entities at exchange rates at the date of the transactions. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated into the 
functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. The foreign currency gain or loss on

monetary items is the difference  between amortised cost in the functional currency at the 
beginning of the period, adjusted for effective  interest and payments during the period, 
and the amortised cost in foreign currency translated at the exchange rate at the end of 
the year.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured 
at fair value are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date 
that the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of 
the transaction.
Foreign currency differences  arising on translation are recognised in profit  or loss, except 
for differences  arising on the translation of financial  liabilities designated as qualifying cash 
flow  hedges, which are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value 
adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into Euro at exchange rates at the 
reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Euro at 
an average rate for the month in which the transactions occurred. However, if exchange 
rates fluctuate  significantly,  the use of the average rate for a period is inappropriate and 
exchanges rates at the date of transactions are used.
Foreign currency differences  on the translation of foreign operations to the functional 
currency of the group are recognised in other comprehensive income, and accumulated in 
the translation reserve, except to the extent that the translation difference  is allocated to 
non-controlling interests.
When the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation 
is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses 
arising from such a monetary item are considered to form part of a net investment in a 
foreign operation and are recognised in other comprehensive income and are presented 
in the translation reserve in equity.
The Group operates in two economies that are considered hyperinflationary,  Argentina 
and Türkiye, and applies IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary  Economies for 
these countries. The impact of the application of IAS 29 is not material for the consolidated 
financial  statements.
3.c Financial instruments
Non-derivative financial assets
Financial assets are classified  on the basis of the business model within which they are 
held and their contractual cash flow  characteristics.
The Group initially recognises trade and other receivables that qualify as financial  assets 
and deposits on the date that they are originated. All other financial  assets (including 
assets designated at fair value through profit  or loss) are recognised initially on the trade 
date at which the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Group derecognises a financial  asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows  
from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows  on the 
financial  asset in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
of the financial  asset are transferred. Any interest in transferred financial  assets that is 
created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset  and the net amount presented in the statement 
of financial  position when, and only when, the Group has a legal right to offset  the 
amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the 
liability simultaneously.
The Group has the following non-derivative financial  assets:
• trade and other receivables
• cash and cash equivalents
• other financial  assets
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are financial  assets held to collect the contractual cash 
flows.  Trade receivables are recognised initially at transaction price minus expected credit 
losses. Other receivables are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable 
transaction costs minus expected credit losses. Subsequent to initial recognition trade and 
other receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective  interest method, less 
any impairment losses.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with original 
maturities of three months or less.

Integrated Report 2023
Non-derivative financial liabilities
The Group initially recognises debt securities issued and subordinated liabilities on the 
date that they originate. All other financial  liabilities are recognised initially on the trade 
date, which is the date that the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument.
The Group derecognises a financial  liability when its contractual obligations are 
discharged, cancelled or expired.
The Group classifies  non-derivative financial  liabilities into the other financial  liabilities 
category. Such financial  liabilities are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly 
attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, these financial  liabilities 
are measured at amortised cost using the effective  interest method.
Other financial  liabilities comprise loans and borrowings, other short-term financial  
liabilities, and trade and other payables that qualify as financial  liabilities.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s 
cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents.
Share capital
Ordinary shares
Ordinary shares are classified  as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue 
of ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects. 
When shares recognised as equity are repurchased, the amount of the consideration 
paid, which includes directly attributable costs, net of any tax effects,  is recognised 
as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares are classified  as treasury shares and 
are presented in the reserve own shares. When treasury shares are sold or reissued 
subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity, and the 
resulting surplus or deficit  on the transaction is presented within share premium.
Derivative financial instruments, including hedge accounting
The Group holds derivative financial  instruments to hedge its foreign currency and interest 
rate risk exposures.
On initial designation of the hedge, the Group formally documents the relationship 
between the hedging instrument(s) and hedged item(s), including the risk management 
objectives and strategy in undertaking the hedge transaction, together with the methods 
that will be used to assess the effectiveness  of the hedging relationship. The Group makes 
an assessment, both at the inception of the hedge relationship as well as on an ongoing 
basis, whether the hedging instruments are expected to be effective  in offsetting  the 
changes in the fair value or cash flows  of the respective hedged items attributable to the 
hedged risk, and whether the following conditions are met:
• there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the 
hedging instrument;
• the effect  of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that 
economic relationship; and
• the hedge ratio is the same as that resulting from actual quantities of hedged items and 
hedging instruments used for risk management.
For a cash flow  hedge of a forecast transaction, the transaction should be highly probable 
to occur and should present an exposure to variations in cash flows  that could ultimately 
affect  reported profit  or loss.
Derivatives are recognised initially at fair value at trading date; attributable transaction 
costs are recognised in profit  or loss as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are accounted for as 
described below.
Cash flow hedges
When a derivative is designated as the hedging instrument in a hedge of the variability in 
cash flows  attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or 
a highly probable forecast transaction that could affect  profit  or loss, the effective  portion 
of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised in other comprehensive income 
and presented in the hedging reserve in equity.
Any ineffective  portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised 
immediately in profit  or loss.
When the hedged item is a non-financial  asset, the amount accumulated in equity is 
included in the carrying amount of the asset when the asset is recognised. In other 
cases the amount accumulated in equity is reclassified  to profit  or loss in the same 
period that the hedged item affects  profit  or loss. If the hedging relationship ceases 
to meet the hedge effectiveness  requirement relating to the hedge ratio but the risk 
management objective for that designated hedging relationship remains the same, the 
hedge ratio will be adjusted so that it meets the qualifying criteria again. If the hedging 
instrument ceases to meet the qualifying criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is

sold, terminated or exercised, or the designation is revoked, then hedge accounting is 
discontinued prospectively. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, 
the balance in equity is reclassified  to profit  or loss.
Other non-trading derivatives
When a derivative financial  instrument is not designated in a hedging relationship that 
qualifies  for hedge accounting, all changes in its fair value are recognised immediately in 
profit  or loss.
3.d Property, plant and equipment
Recognition and measurement
Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Cost 
may also include transfers from equity of any gain or loss on qualifying cash flow  hedges 
of foreign currency purchases of property, plant and equipment. Purchased software that 
is an integral part of the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of 
that equipment.
If major components of an item of property, plant and equipment have different  useful 
lives, these components are accounted for separately.
Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined 
by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and 
equipment and are recognised in profit  or loss.
Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it is probable that the future economic 
benefits  associated with the expenditure will flow  to the Group. The costs of the day-to-day 
servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit  or loss as incurred.
Depreciation
Depreciation is based on the cost of an asset less its residual value. Significant  components 
of individual assets are assessed and if a component has a useful life that is different  from 
the remainder of that asset, that component is depreciated separately.
Depreciation is recognised in profit  or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated 
useful lives of each component of an item of property, plant and equipment. Right of use 
assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is 
reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Land 
is not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative years are as follows:
Buildings : 20 - 40 years
Reconstructions and improvements : 5 - 12 years
Hardware and software : 3 - 5 years
Other non-current tangible assets : 3 - 5 years
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial  year 
end and adjusted if appropriate.
3.e Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill 
is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. On disposal of a business, 
business segment or cash generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is assessed 
and included in the determination of the profit  and loss on disposal.
Other intangible assets
Supplier relations
At acquisition date, the supplier relations are recognised at fair value based on the excess 
earnings method. For all material supplier bases the initial valuation has been performed 
by an external valuator. Subsequent measurement is based on costs less amortisation. The 
estimation of the useful life of each supplier base is usually based on a cut-off  calculation 
that excludes future years from the remaining useful life that account for less than 5% of 
the total present value of the excess earnings, unless this leads to a calculated useful life 
not being a proper representation of the actual useful life of the supplier relations.
Intellectual property rights, distribution rights, brand names and other intangible assets
In addition to supplier relations, intangible assets include intellectual property rights, 
distribution rights, brand names, order books acquired and non-compete rights. Other 
intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations are measured on initial 
recognition at their fair value on the date of acquisition. Intangible assets acquired 
separately are measured at cost, where intangible assets with indefinite  useful lives 
are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Subsequently, intangible assets

which have finite  useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
accumulated impairment losses.
Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when  it increases the future economic 
benefits  embodied in the specific  asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including 
expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognised in profit  or loss 
as incurred.
Amortisation
Amortisation is based on the cost of an asset less its residual value. Amortisation is 
recognised in profit  or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of 
intangible assets, other than goodwill, from the date that they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative years are as follows:
IMCD brand name : indefinite 
Intellectual property rights : 7 years
Supplier relations acquired through business combinations : 4- 16years
Other distribution, non-compete rights and order books : (initial) contract term
Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date 
and adjusted if appropriate.
3.f Leases
The Group assesses at inception of the contract whether a contract is or contains a lease. 
The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect 
to all lease arrangements in which it is the lessee except for short-term leases (defined  as 
leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and low-value leases. For these leases the 
Group recognises the lease payments as operating expenses on a straight-line basis over 
the term of the lease.
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are 
not paid at the commencement date, discounted by using the rate implicit in the lease. If 
this rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate.
Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise:
• Fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed  payments), less any lease 
incentives receivable
• Variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the 
index or rate at the commencement date
• The amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees
• The exercise price of purchase options, if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise 
the options and
• Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects  the exercise of 
an option to terminate the lease
The lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect  
interest on the lease liability (using the effective  interest method) and by reducing the 
carrying amount to reflect  the lease payments made.
The Group remeasures the lease liability (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the 
related right-of-use asset) whenever:
• The lease term has changed or there is a significant  event or change in circumstances 
resulting in a change in the assessment of exercising a purchase option, in which case 
the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a 
revised discount rate.
• The lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a change in 
expected payment under a guaranteed residual value, in which cases the lease liability 
is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using an unchanged discount 
rate (unless the lease payments change is due to a change in a floating  interest rate, in 
which case a revised discount rate is used).
• A lease contract is modified  and the lease modification  is not accounted for as a 
separate lease, in which case the lease liability is remeasured based on the lease 
term of the modified  lease by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised 
discount rate at the effective  date of the modification. 
The Group did not make any such adjustments during the periods presented.
The right-of-use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease 
liability, lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease 
incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to 
dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the 
site on which it is located. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation or amortisation and impairment losses.

Page 207:
Integrated Report 2023
Right-of-use assets are amortised or depreciated over the shorter period of lease term and 
useful life of the underlying asset. If a lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset 
or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects  that the Group expects to exercise a purchase 
option, the related right-of-use asset is depreciated or amortised over the useful life of the 
underlying asset. The depreciation or amortisation starts at the commencement date of 
the lease.
The Group applies IAS 36 to determine whether a right-of-use asset is impaired and 
accounts for any identified  impairment loss as described in note 3.h.
Variable rents that do not depend on an index or rate are not included in the 
measurement of the lease liability and the right-of-use asset. The related payments are 
recognised as an expense in the period in which the event or condition that triggers those 
payments occurs and are included in the line “Other operating expenses” in profit  or loss.
As a practical expedient, IFRS 16 permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components, 
and instead account for any lease and associated non-lease components as a single 
arrangement. The Group has not used this practical expedient. For a contract that contains 
a lease component and one or more additional lease or non-lease components, the Group 
allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the 
relative stand-alone price of the lease component and the aggregate stand-alone price of 
the non-lease components.
The Group presents right‑of‑use assets that do not meet the definition  of investment 
property in ‘property, plant and equipment’ and 'intangible assets' and lease liabilities in 
‘loans and borrowings’ in the statement of financial  position.
3.g Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of 
inventories is based on the weighted average method and includes expenditure incurred 
in acquiring the inventories, conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to 
their existing location and condition. Cost also may include transfers from equity of any 
gain or loss on qualifying cash flow  hedges of foreign currency purchases of inventories.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less 
the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
3.h Impairment
Financial assets
An allowance for expected credit losses (ECL) is recognised for all financial  assets not 
carried at fair value through profit  or loss.
An ECL is determined as the difference  between the contractual cash flows  and the 
estimated expected cash flows  to be collected, considering the potential risk of default.
An ECL is provided for a credit loss that results from a loss event possible within the next 
12 months (a 12-month ECL). For credit exposures with a significant  increase in credit risk a 
lifetime ECL is recognised and assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there 
is objective evidence that it is impaired.
Objective evidence that financial  assets require an ECL can include the default of or 
delinquency by a debtor, restructuring of an amount due to the Group on terms that 
the Group would not consider otherwise, indications that a debtor or issuer will enter 
bankruptcy, adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers or issuers or observable 
data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in expected cash flows  from a group of 
financial  assets.
A simplified  approach is used to determine the ECL for trade receivables, contract assets 
and lease receivables. A loss allowance is determined based on lifetime ECL on each 
reporting date.
The Group considers evidence of impairment for receivables at both a specific  asset and 
collective level. All individually significant  receivables are assessed for specific  impairment. 
All individually significant  receivables found not to be specifically  impaired are then 
collectively assessed for any impairment that has been incurred but not yet identified.  
Receivables that are not individually significant  are collectively assessed for impairment by 
grouping together loans and receivables with similar risk characteristics.
A provision matrix is used to determine the expected credit loss based on the Group’s 
historical trends of incurred losses, allocated to each aging category, adjusted for specific  
debtor provisions, insurance coverage and general economic developments. Management 
judges whether current economic and credit conditions are such that the actual losses 
are likely to be greater or less than suggested by historical trends. An impairment loss 
in respect of a financial  asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference  
between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows  
discounted at the asset’s original effective  interest rate. Losses are recognised in profit

or loss and reflected  in an allowance account against loans and receivables or held-to-
maturity investment securities. Interest on the impaired asset continues to be recognised.
When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the 
decrease in impairment loss is reversed through profit  or loss.
Equity accounted investees
An impairment loss in respect of an equity accounted investee is measured by comparing 
the recoverable amount of the investment with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is 
recognised in profit  or loss and is reversed if there has been a favourable change in the 
estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
 
Non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial  assets, other than inventories and 
deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is 
any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable 
amount is estimated. For goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite  useful 
lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at the 
reporting date.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its related cash 
generating unit (CGU) exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair 
value less costs of disposal.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows  are discounted to their present 
value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects  current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific  to the asset or CGU. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into 
the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows  from continuing use that are 
largely independent of the cash inflows  of other assets or CGUs. Subject to an operating 
segment ceiling test, for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, CGUs to which 
goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing 
is performed reflects  the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting 
purposes. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that 
are expected to benefit  from the synergies of the combination.
The Group’s corporate assets do not generate separate cash inflows  and are utilised 
by more than one CGU. Corporate assets are allocated to CGUs on a reasonable and 
consistent basis and tested for impairment as part of the testing of the CGU to which the 
corporate asset is allocated.
Impairment losses are recognised in profit  or loss and recorded as part of amortisation of 
intangible assets in the consolidated statement of profit  or loss and other comprehensive 
income. Subsequently, impairment losses are separately disclosed in the intangible assets 
movement schedule in Note 18. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are 
allocated first  to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU (group 
of CGUs), and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU (group 
of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment 
loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if 
no impairment loss had been recognised.
3.i Employee benefits
Defined contribution plans
A defined  contribution plan is a post-employment benefit  plan under which an entity pays 
fixed  contributions to a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to 
pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined  contribution pension plans 
are recognised as an employee benefit  expense in profit  or loss in the periods during 
which services are rendered by employees. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an 
asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available.
Defined benefit plans
A defined  benefit  plan is a post-employment benefit  plan other than a defined  contribution 
plan. The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined  benefit  pension plans is calculated 
separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit  that employees 
have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit  is 
discounted to determine its present value.
The obligation arising from these defined  benefit  plans are determined on the basis 
of projected unit credit method. The calculation of the defined  benefit  obligations is 
performed annually by qualified  actuaries.

Integrated Report 2023
Remeasurements of the net defined  benefit  liability, which comprise actuarial gains and 
losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect  of the asset ceiling 
(if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in OCI. The Group determines the 
net interest expense (income) on the net defined  benefit  liability (asset) for the period by 
applying the discount rate used to measure the defined  benefit  obligation at the beginning 
of the annual period to the then-net defined  benefit  liability (asset), taking into account 
any changes in the net defined  benefit  liability (asset) during the period as a result of 
contributions and benefit  payments. Net interest expense and other expenses related to 
defined  benefit  plans are recognised in profit  or loss.
When the benefits  of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change 
in benefit  that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised 
immediately in profit  or loss. The Group recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a 
defined  benefit  plan when the settlement occurs.
Other long-term employee benefits
The Group’s net obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits  is the amount of 
future benefit  that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and 
prior periods. That benefit  is discounted to determine its present value.
The calculation of the other long-term employee benefits  is performed using the projected 
unit credit method. Any actuarial gains and losses are recognised in profit  or loss in the 
period in which they arise.
Termination benefits
Termination benefits  are expensed at the earlier of when the Group can no longer 
withdraw the offer  of those benefits  and when the Group recognises costs for 
restructuring. If benefits  are not expected to be settled wholly within 12 months of the 
end of the reporting period, then these benefits  are discounted.
Share based payment transactions
The grant date fair value of equity-settled share based payment awards granted to 
employees is recognised as personnel expenses, with a corresponding increase in equity, 
over the vesting period of the awards. The grant date fair value is generally equal to the 
share price at the grant date, adjusted for:
1. expected dividends
2. marketability discounts for restriction periods (using the Finnerty model)
3. market conditions (using Monte Carlo simulations)
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect  the number of awards for 
which the related service and non-market performance conditions are expected to be met, 
such that the amount ultimately recognised is based on the number of awards that meet 
the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefit  obligations are expensed as the related service is provided. A 
liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or 
profit-sharing  plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this 
amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be 
estimated reliably.
3.j Provisions
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal 
or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an 
outflow  of resources will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined 
by discounting the expected future cash flows  at a pre-tax rate that reflects  current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific  to the liability. The 
unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance  cost.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed 
and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been 
announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided for.
3.k Revenue
Sale of goods
Revenue from the sale of goods in the course of ordinary activities is recognised when 
the performance obligation is satisfied  and transfer of control is established. The amount 
recognised is the amount of the transaction price allocated to the performance obligation.
If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, such as discounts 
and/or rebates, the Group estimates the amount of consideration to which the Group will 
be entitled in exchange for the sale of goods.
The timing of the transfer of control varies depending on the individual terms of the 
sales agreement.

Commissions
When the Group arranges to provide goods from the supplier to the customer and does 
not obtain control over the goods, the Group acts in the capacity of an agent rather than 
as the principal. The revenue arising from such a transaction is recognised as the net 
amount of commission made by the Group.
3.l Finance income and expenses
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and gains on hedging 
instruments that are recognised in profit  or loss. Interest income is recognised using the 
effective  interest method.
Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on 
provisions and contingent consideration, impairment losses recognised on financial  assets 
(other than trade receivables) and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in 
profit  or loss.
Finance income and expenses includes results of changes of the fair value of contingent 
considerations classified  as financial  liabilities.
Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition of a qualifying asset are 
recognised in profit  or loss using the effective  interest method.
Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis as either finance  income or 
finance  cost depending on whether foreign currency movements are in a net gain or net 
loss position.
3.m Income tax
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are 
recognised in profit  or loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, 
or items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
Current tax
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for 
the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date and any 
adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Current tax payable also includes 
any tax liability arising from the declaration of dividends.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences  between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial  reporting purposes and the amounts used 
for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is not recognised for:
• temporary differences  on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction 
that is not a business combination and that affects  neither accounting nor taxable profit  
or loss
• temporary differences  related to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is 
probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future
• taxable temporary differences  arising on the initial recognition of goodwill
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary 
differences  when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset  if there is a legally enforceable right to offset  
current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax 
authority on the same taxable entity, or on different  tax entities, but they intend to settle 
current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be 
realised simultaneously.
A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible 
temporary differences,  to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits  will 
be available against which they can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each 
reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related 
tax benefit  will be realised.
3.n Segment reporting
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities 
from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses 
that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components. The segmentation 
used by the Group is based on geography, organisation and management structure and 
commercial interdependencies.
Segment results that are reported to the CEO include items directly attributable to a 
segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items 
comprise mainly corporate assets (primarily the Company’s headquarters), head office

4 Determination of fair values
A number of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of 
fair value, for both financial  and non-financial  assets and liabilities. Fair values have been 
determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based the methods described 
below. When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining 
fair values is disclosed in the notes specific  to that asset or liability and in Note 33 
Financial Instruments.
Property, plant and equipment
The fair value of property, plant and equipment recognised as a result of a business 
combination is the estimated amount for which a property could be exchanged on the 
date of acquisition between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an at arm’s-length 
transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably. 
The fair value of items of plant, equipment, fixtures  and fittings  is based on the 
market approach and cost approaches using quoted market prices for similar items 
when available and replacement cost when appropriate. Depreciated replacement cost 
estimates reflect  adjustments for physical deterioration as well as functional and 
economic obsolescence.
Intangible assets
The fair value of other intangible assets acquired in a business combination is based 
on the discounted cash flows  expected to be derived from the use and eventual sale of 
the assets.
Inventories
The fair value of inventories acquired in a business combination is determined based on 
the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs 
of completion and sale, and a reasonable profit  margin based on the effort  required to 
complete and sell the inventories.
Forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on their quoted price, if available. If 
a quoted price is not available, then fair value is estimated by discounting the difference  
between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual 
maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds).
The fair value of interest rate swaps is based on quotes acquired from financial  
institutions. Fair values reflect  the credit risk of the instrument and include adjustments to 
take account of the credit risk of the Group entity and counterparty when appropriate.
Other non-derivative financial liabilities
Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present 
value of future principal and interest cash flows,  discounted at the market rate of interest 
at the reporting date. For finance  leases the market rate of interest is determined by 
reference to similar lease agreements.
Contingent considerations
The fair value of contingent considerations is calculated using the income approach based 
on the expected payment amounts and their associated probabilities (i.e. probability-
weighted). Contingent considerations with a term longer than one year are discounted 
to present value.
Defined benefit plans
The fair value of the plan assets is based on the actuarial assumptions determined by 
certified  actuaries.

5 Financial risk management
5.a Risk management framework
Risk management tasks and responsibilities
The IMCD risk management policy is aimed at optimising the balance between 
maximisation of business opportunities within the framework of the Group's strategy, 
while managing the risks involved.
Although the Group benefits  from geographical, market, client and product portfolio 
spread, the Group’s well structured risk management process should manage its residual 
risks in a transparent and controlled manner.
The Group's risk management and control systems are established to identify and analyse 
the risks faced by the Group at various levels, to set appropriate risk controls, and to 
monitor risks and the way the risks are controlled.
Key activities within the Group's risk management and control systems are:
• identification  of key business risks, based on likelihood of occurrence and their 
potential impact
• setting controls for managing these key risks
Risk management elements
The elements of IMCD’s risk management system are the following:
Control environment, including:
• organisational culture based on ethical conduct and compliance, clear responsibilities 
and short and open communication lines
• IMCD’s policies including business principles, management instructions and manuals
• continuous compliance training of employees
• risk management embedded in the business processes on all organisational levels
• internal financial  reviews and risk assessments performed by the Group, in accordance 
with Internal Audit
Risk assessment and control procedures, including:
• identification  of risks via risk self-assessments coordinated by Corporate Control and 
Corporate Health, Safety, Environment, Quality and Regulatory (HSEQR)
• implementing and optimisation of effective  and efficient  control procedures on various 
levels in the organisation
Information, communication and monitoring, including:
• harmonised reporting on operations, financial  results and positions and risks
• periodical reviews of financial  results and risk management by the Management Board 
and Corporate Control
• periodical reviews on HSEQR management by Corporate HSEQR
• regular review meetings between Group and local management
The Management Board, under supervision of the Supervisory Board, has overall 
responsibility for the IMCD risk management and control systems. Management of 
regional and operating companies is responsible for local operational performance and 
for managing the associated local risks.
5.b Overview financial risks
The Group has exposure to the following financial  risks:
• credit risk
• liquidity risk
• market risk
• operational risk
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, 
the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the 
Group’s management of capital. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout 
these consolidated financial  statements.
5.c Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial  loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a 
financial  instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the 
Group’s receivables from customers.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced  mainly by the individual characteristics 
of each customer. However, management also considers the demographics of the Group’s 
customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers 
operate, as these factors  may have an influence  on credit risk. This has been of increased 
importance due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There is no geographical concentration of 
credit risk nor significant  credit risk on individual customer level.
The Group has established a credit policy in which each new customer is analysed 
individually for creditworthiness before the Group’s payment and delivery terms and 
conditions are offered.  The Group’s review includes the use of external ratings,

when available, and in some cases bank references. Purchase limits are established 
for each customer, which represent the maximum open amount. These limits are 
reviewed periodically.
Customers that fail to meet the Group’s benchmark creditworthiness may transact with 
the Group only on a prepayment basis.
At the reporting date, there were no significant  concentrations of credit risk. The maximum 
exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial  asset.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of 
expected losses in respect of trade and other receivables. The main components of this 
allowance are a specific  loss component that relates to individually significant  exposures, 
and a collective loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of 
losses that are expected but not yet identified.  The collective loss allowance is determined 
based on historical data of payment statistics for similar financial  assets, adjusted for 
forward-looking information.
To mitigate the counterparty risk with financial  institutions the Group's policy is to make 
use of financial  institutions which are investment grade. The Group’s main financial  
institutions are systemically important and are under close supervision by their respective 
financial  regulatory bodies.
5.d Liquidity risks
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty  in meeting the obligations 
associated with its financial  liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another 
financial  asset. The Group’s approach to manage liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, 
that it will always have sufficient  cash to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal 
and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the 
Group’s reputation.
The Group typically ensures that it generally has sufficient  cash on demand to meet 
expected operational expenses for the next twelve months, including the servicing of 
financial  obligations. This excludes the potential impact of extreme circumstances that 
cannot reasonably be predicted.
In addition, the Group maintains the following lines of credit:
• EUR 600 million multi-currency revolving credit facility with a maturity date of 
8 February 2029 and can be drawn in EUR and USD as well as, to an agreed sublimit, in 
AUD and GBP. The credit revolving facility has an interest margin dependent on credit 
ratings (S&P, Moody’s or Fitch). As of 31 December 2023, the Group had an undrawn 
revolving facility of EUR 464 million.
• Several credit facilities available to the subsidiaries, mainly in United States, China, 
Spain, Italy, Australia, India, Indonesia and South Africa.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial  liabilities, including estimated 
interest payments. The contractual cash flows  are undiscounted.

5.e Market risks
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates 
and interest rates will affect  the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial  
instruments. Group management focuses on managing and controlling market risk 
exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the operating result.
The Group buys derivatives, and also incurs financial  liabilities, in order to manage market 
risks. All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by Group Management. 
The Group generally seeks to use hedging instruments to manage volatility in profit  or loss.
Currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are 
denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of Group 
entities, primarily the Euro (EUR), United States of America Dollar (USD) and the Pound 
Sterling (GBP).
The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk, mainly by using 
contracts having a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date.
Interest on borrowings is denominated in the currency of the borrowing. Generally, 
borrowings are denominated in currencies that match the cash flows  generated by 
the underlying operations of the Group, primarily EUR and USD. This provides an 
economic hedge without derivatives being entered into. Hedge accounting is not applied in 
these circumstances.
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the 
Group’s policy is to ensure that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or 
selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary to address short-term imbalances.
Exposure to currency risk
The Group’s net exposure to foreign currency risk based on notional and hedged amounts 
of monetary assets and liabilities was as follows:

5.f Operational risks
Operational risk is the risk of direct or indirect loss arising from a wide variety of causes 
associated with the Group’s processes, personnel, technology and infrastructure and 
from external factors other than credit, market and liquidity risks such as those arising 
from legal and regulatory requirements and generally accepted standards of corporate 
behaviour. Operational risks arise from all of the Group’s operations.
The Group’s objective is to manage operational risk so as to balance the avoidance of 
financial  losses and damage to the Group’s reputation with overall cost effectiveness  and 
to avoid control procedures that restrict initiative and creativity.
5.g Capital management
The primary objective when managing capital is to safeguard the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern by means of optimising the debt and equity balance. The 
Company does not have an explicit return on capital policy. There have been no changes 
in the capital management policies during the year. The Group is not subject to any 
externally imposed capital requirements. Capital is considered by the Company to be 
equity as shown in the statement of financial  position.
The Group’s net liabilities and adjusted equity at the reporting date are as follows:
EUR 1,000 2023 2022
Total liabilities 2,428,389 1,970,094
Less: Cash and cash equivalents (394,462) (222,005)
Net liabilities 2,033,927 1,748,089
Total equity 1,726,185 1,673,416

Integrated Report 2023
6 Operating segments
In presenting information on the basis of operating segments, segment revenue is based 
on the geographical location of the Group´s operations. Segment assets are based on 
the geographical location of the assets with the exception of assets related to holding 
companies, which are presented in a separate reporting unit.
Transactions between companies within an operating segment have been eliminated. 
Transactions between operating segments are based on arm’s-length principle and are 
not included in the reported revenue per segment as the reported revenue per segment 
relates to revenue with third parties.
A key performance indicator for controlling the results of the operating segments is 
Operating EBITA.
Operating EBITA is defined  as the sum of the result from operating activities, amortisation 
of intangible assets, and non-recurring items. Non-recurring items, as disclosed in Note 
11, include:
• income related to divestments
• cost of corporate restructurings and reorganisations
• cost related to realised and non-realised acquisitions
While the amounts included in Operating EBITA are derived from the Group’s financial  
information, it is not a financial  measure determined in accordance with adopted IFRS and 
should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or result from operating 
activities as a sole indicator of the Group’s performance or as an alternative to cash 
flows  as a measure of the Group’s liquidity. The Group uses Operating EBITA as a key 
performance indicator in its business operations in order to, among other things, develop 
budgets, measure its performance against those budgets and evaluate the performance of 
its operations.
The bridge from result from operating activities to operating EBITA is as follows:
EUR 1,000 2023 2022
Result from operating activities 428,523 461,758
Amortisation of intangible assets 80,934 81,478
Non-recurring items 5,076 11,217
Operating EBITA 514,533 554,453
The non-recurring income and expenses included in the result from operating activities of 
2023 and 2022 mainly relate to income from divestments of business and assets, costs of 
acquisitions of businesses and costs related to one-off  adjustments to the organisation, 
which included in 2022 the winding down of the operations in Russia.
Operating expenses of non-operating companies are reported in the segment Holding 
companies. Inter-segmented amounts receivable and amounts payable are not considered 
in the value of the total assets and total liabilities of each segment. The results of the 
operating segments are as follows:
EMEA
EUR 1,000 2023 2022
Revenue 1,942,612 2,006,391
Gross profit 529,689 529,731

Total Assets 1,152,439 1,074,358
Total Liabilities 364,379 338,321

Reported revenue per segment relates to revenue with third parties, hence no inter-
segment revenues are included. IMCD and its operating segments have a diverse customer 
base of about 64,000 customers in many countries and of various sizes. IMCD and 
its segments do not rely on a single customer or a single group of customers for its 
operations. With a supplier base of approximately 3,200 suppliers and product portfolio of 
about 48,000 products, the same applies with regard to the reliance on a single supplier or 
a single group of suppliers and a single product or range of products.

1 January 2023, management estimates that the consolidated revenue would have been 
EUR 4,588.8 million and the consolidated net profit  would have been EUR 303.3 million. 
In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments,

if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2023. The total consideration related to the 
aforementioned transactions, transferred in cash in 2023, amounts to EUR 364.7 million.

an agreement on 16 February 2024 to acquire the business of the speciality distribution

7 .3 Other acquisition related transactions
In December 2023, IMCD exercised its call option to acquire the remaining 30% interest 
of the shares from the minority shareholders of Signet. The completion of the acquisition 
of the remaining 30% was executed on the basis of the share purchase agreement of 
September 2020. As IMCD obtained full control over Signet as per November 2020, this 
purchase price obligation was included in IMCD’s reported net debt position and results of 
Signet are consolidated in full into the IMCD figures  since the November 2020 acquisition 
date. As a result, this completion, as such, will not impact the reported leverage or 
earnings levels of IMCD. Refer to Note 27 and Note 29 for details of the transaction.

The intangible assets recognised primarily relate to supplier relationships acquired.
The supplier relations have been determined by applying the multi-period excess 
earnings method. This method considers the present value of net cash flows  expected 
to be generated by the supplier relationships, by excluding any cash flows  related 
to contributory assets. The cash flows  which have been used as input were based 
on the projections made by the sellers, adjusted for future supplier losses due to 
exclusivity conflicts,  projected market developments based on external sources and our 
own expectations based on our extensive market knowledge. Furthermore, attrition rates 
are determined based on the annual decrease in revenues related to suppliers (when 
applicable) in the most recent financial  years, adjusted for annual inflation.  These attrition 
rates have been applied in the projections.
The gross contractual value of the trade and other receivables acquired amounts to 
EUR 53.3 million of which EUR 9.8 million relates to Sanrise, EUR 4.6 million relates to 
Sachs and EUR 4.2 million relates to Brylchem.

chemicals and ingredients. Other sources of revenue include revenue from commission 
where the Group acts as agent in the sale and distribution of speciality chemicals 
and ingredients.
EUR 1,000 2023 2022
Sales of goods 4,430,812 4,587,514
Commissions 11,830 13,979
Total Revenue 4,442,642 4,601,493
Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified  in a contract with a customer. 
The Group recognises revenue when it transfers control over a good or service to a 
customer. The nature and timing of the fulfilment  of performance obligations is disclosed 
in contracts with customers upon the sale and distribution of speciality chemicals 
and ingredients. The Group recognizes revenue when control is transferred which is 
at the moment that ownership is transferred to the customer, primarily based on 
agreed incoterms.
In the following tables, revenue from contracts with customers is disaggregated by primary 
geographical market and their market segments, being Life Science and Industrial.
8.1 Geographical Market
The breakdown of revenue by geographical market is as follows:
EUR 1,000 2023 2022
Netherlands 69,165 85,581
Rest of EMEA 1,873,447 1,920,810

Total Geographical Market 4,442,642 4,601,493
8.2 Market segments
IMCD's business model is based on long lasting relationships with suppliers of speciality 
chemicals and ingredients. In order to provide more insight in the segmentation per 
market, IMCD has decided to break down the sales in the market segments Life Science 
and Industrial.
Life Science consists of the following lines of business: Pharmaceuticals, Beauty & Personal 
Care, Food & Nutrition and Home Care and I&I. In general, the lines of business within 
Life Science historically have been less sensitive to economic fluctuations.  Furthermore, 
the Life Science segment consists of lower order volumes and higher margins than the 
Industrials market segment.
The Industrial segment contains the lines of business of Coatings & Construction, 
Lubricants & Energy, Industrial Solutions and Advanced Materials. This segment has a 
more cyclical nature as the performance is dependent on the developments of, amongst 
others, the housing and real estate, automotive and oil & gas markets.
The breakdown of sales of goods per market segment is as follows:
EUR 1,000 2023 2022
Life Science 2,328,782 2,290,944
Industrial 2,102,030 2,296,570
Total Market Segments 4,430,812 4,587,514
9 Other income
EUR 1,000 2023 2022
Other income 27,532 24,822
Total Other income 27,532 24,822
Other income primarily relates to logistic and other services charged separately to 
customers. In 2023, other income included non-recurring income of EUR 7.2 million, mainly 
related to the sale of a warehouse in US. Other income of 2022 includes non-recurring 
income of EUR 4.3 million, mainly related to the sale of a warehouse in Indonesia.

12 Share based payment arrangements
Description of the share based payment arrangement
As of 1 January 2015, the Group established a long-term incentive plan (LTIP) for the 
Management Board, the Executive Committee and certain senior managers. Under this 
equity settled LTIP, performance shares are awarded based on certain performance 
conditions. Aims of the LTIP are long-term value creation, motivation and sharing of 
success and the retention of key employees.
The applicable performance conditions for the Management Board are:
• relative Total Shareholder Return performance (market-related condition) compared 
with a selected group of peer companies and
• cash earnings per share (internal performance condition)
The performance period starts every year on 1 January and lasts three financial  years. After 
vesting, the unconditional shares are subject to a holding period of two years and become 
unrestricted five  years after grant date.
The performance conditions for the Executive Committee and for senior managers are 
solely internal performance conditions and include:
• growth in cash earnings per share (only for the Executive Committee)
• operating EBITA
• discretionary assessment by the Management Board
The performance period starts every year on 1 January and lasts one year. The shares 
become unconditional after a service period of three years, i.e. two years after the 
performance period.
Reconciliation of outstanding performance shares

Shares granted to Executive Committee 
and certain senior managers
24,488 140.83 19,821 195.45
The total number of performance shares granted in 2023 is based on a target performance 
(100 per cent) with an upward and downward potential for the Management Board and 
the Executive Committee. The expected total number of performance shares is 104,882 
with vesting dates in 2024, 2025 and 2026.
As Marcus Jordan (COO) first  participated in the Management Board's LTI Plan in 2023, 
the shares related to prior year plans are included in the shares granted to Executive 
Committee and certain senior managers.
The weighted average share price and the number of performance shares are as follows:

The weighted average share price of granted shares is equal to the share price at the grant 
date adjusted for the expected retention and expected dividends, based on the Company's 
dividend policy, during the vesting period. In addition, the weighted average share price 
of shares granted to the Management Board is adjusted for market-related performance 
conditions and for the impact of the restriction period.

Integrated Report 2023
Goodwill impairment testing
For the purpose of goodwill impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the following cash 
generating units.
EUR 1,000 2023 2022
EMEA 444,897 386,793
Americas 421,491 376,058
Asia-Pacific 745,962 623,701
1,612,350 1,386,552
A cash generating unit (CGU) represents the lowest level within the Group at which 
goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Key assumptions used in discounted cash flow projections
The recoverable amount per CGU is based on its value in use and is determined by 
discounting the future cash flows  to be generated from the continued use of the CGUs. 
The cash flow  forecasts were derived from the budget for 2024 and the plan years 2025 
and 2026 which were established at the legal entity level and approved by Management 
Board and Supervisory Board. The forecasted cash flows  have been extrapolated to the 
years 2027 and 2028. For the period after 2029 a growth rate equal to the weighted 
average of the forecasted annual real GDP growth rate for the period 2029-2054 is taken 
into account.
The pre-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is estimated per CGU and varies 
mainly due to differences  in risk free rates. The risk-free rates per CGU are equal to the 
weighted average of the rate of return on local sovereign bonds or strips. The WACC 
has predominately increased due to higher risk-free rates. The main assumptions used to 
determine the WACC were assessed by an external certified  valuation expert.
The key assumptions for 2023 and 2022 for each CGU are as follows:
2023 2022
PRE-TAX WACC
TERMINAL
GROWTH RATE PRE-TAX WACC
TERMINAL
GROWTH RATE
EMEA 14.5% 2.8% 11.0% 2.4%
Americas 16.7% 2.7% 14.2% 2.4%
Asia-Pacific 15.0% 3.5% 15.5% 3.5%
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
No impairment of goodwill was necessary following impairment tests on all cash 
generating units within the Group. The discounted future cash flows  from all cash 
generating units exceed the value of the goodwill and other relevant net assets.
It is inherent in the method of computation used that a change in the assumptions may 
lead to a different  conclusion. Therefore, a sensitivity analysis is performed based on a 
change in a key assumption while keeping all other assumptions unchanged.
The following changes in assumptions are assessed:
• Decrease of the average growth rate 2023-2027 to the terminal growth rate
• Decrease of the terminal growth rate by 1.0%
• Increase of the WACC by 1.0%
The conclusion based on the sensitivity analysis performed is that any reasonable change 
in the key assumptions would not lead to an impairment. For Asia-Pacific  the break-even 
point is reached earlier than the other segments, but taking into account the considerable 
growth of the region and the expansion by means of the recent acquisition of Signet this 
scenario is highly unlikely.
Amortisation and impairment testing of supplier relationships
The supplier relationships consist of supplier bases within the following regions and 
remaining useful lives (RUL):
EUR 1,000 RUL 2023 2022
EMEA 4-13 115,586 106,307
Americas 5-16 151,953 129,088
Asia-Pacific 4-16 324,679 269,467
592,218 504,861
The remaining useful lives of supplier bases are assessed at each reporting date and 
adjusted if appropriate. Furthermore, triggering events for a possible impairment are 
evaluated annually by means of assessing the potential impact of available internal and 
external information sources.

Impairment testing for cash-generating units containing intangible assets 
with indefinite useful lives other than goodwill
Brand names relate to the IMCD brand. As no assumption can be made about the 
durability of its economic use, the brand name has an indefinite  useful life. The IMCD 
brand name is considered as a corporate asset and hence allocated to the individual CGUs 
for goodwill impairment testing purposes. The carrying amount of the brand name has 
been allocated to the CGUs as follows: EMEA: EUR 10.9 million (2022: EUR 10.9 million), 
Asia-Pacific:  EUR 6.1 million (2022: EUR 5.5 million) and Americas: EUR 7.9 million (2022: 
EUR 8.6 million).

Retained earnings
Retained earnings are the cumulative net earnings or profits  of a company after 
accounting for dividend payments.
In December 2023, IMCD completed the acquisition of the remaining 30% interest in 
Signet. It was executed on the basis of the share purchase agreement of September 2020. 
The increase in the consideration payable of EUR 51.6 million resulted from the improved 
actual level of profitability  of Signet, compared with the assumptions used in the previous 
fair value determination. This increase is accounted through retained earnings. Refer to 
Note 7 and Note 29 for further details of the transaction.

AUD, EUR 3.4 million in CHF. The remaining amount of EUR 17.6 million is denominated in 
various currencies.
On 8 February 2023, IMCD completed the refinancing  of its multi-currency revolving 
credit facility. The new facility, with a maturity data of 8 February 2029, amounts to 
EUR 600 million and can be drawn in EUR and USD as well as, to an agreed sublimit, in AUD 
and GBP. The credit revolving facility has an interest margin dependent on external credit 
ratings. For the new revolving credit facility a maximum leverage of 3.75 times EBITDA 
(with a spike period maximum of 4.25), tested semi-annually is applicable.
On 18 September 2023, IMCD issued an EUR 500 million rated corporate bond loan 
with institutional investors. This five-year  senior unsecured bond loan matures on 
18 September 2028 and has a fixed  coupon of 4.875%. The bond loan is traded on 
the EURO MTF market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The proceeds of the bond 
loan issue will be used for general corporate purposes, including the refinancing  of 
existing indebtedness.
The first  senior unsecured fixed  rates note, issued by IMCD N.V. on 26 March 2018, had 
a closing price of EUR 98.42 at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: EUR 97,08 ). The 
second senior unsecured fixed  rates note, issued by IMCD N.V. on 31 March 2022, had 
a closing price of EUR 95.55 at 31 December 2023. The third unsecured fixed  rates note, 
issued by IMCD N.V. on 18 September 2023, had a closing price of EUR 104.78
The bonds are listed on the Luxembourg Euro MTF market and matures on respectively 
26 March 2025, 31 March 2027 and 18 September 2028.
The Group is obliged to meet requirements from the covenants in connection with the 
interest bearing loan facilities. These requirements relate to ratios for maximum leverage.
The leverage covenants apply to the Group as at 31 December 2023:
• For the revolving credit facility of EUR 600 million, a maximum leverage of 3.75 times 
EBITDA applies (with a spike period maximum of 4.25), tested semi-annually.
2023 2022
OUTCOME COVENANT OUTCOME COVENANT
Reported leverage 2.3 1.8
Leverage including pro-forma results 2.3 1.7
Leverage loan documentation 1.7 max. 3.75 1.2 max. 3.75
The actual reported leverage ratio as at 31 December 2023 was 2.3 times EBITDA 
(31 December 2022: 1.8 times EBITDA). Including the full year impact of acquisitions 
completed in 2023, the leverage at the end of the financial  year is 2.3 times EBITDA 
(31 December 2022: 1.7 times EBITDA). The leverage ratio calculated on the basis of the 
definitions  used in the loan documentation applicable as at 31 December 2023 was 1.7 
times EBITDA (31 December 2022: 1.2 times EBITDA), which is well below the defined  
maximum of 3.75 times EBITDA.

The other non-cash movements include fair value adjustments related to a net reduction 
in the estimated deferred and contingent consideration, mainly related to Sanrise (China) 
of EUR 15.6 million and Megasetia (Indonesia) of EUR 12.0 million.
The other liabilities include the consideration payable to the minority shareholders of 
Signet following the completion of the acquisition of the remaining 30% interest in 
December 2023. The completion was executed on the basis of the share purchase 
agreement of September 2020. The consideration payable in other liabilities follows from 
the movements included, a reclassification  from the deferred consideration and a non-
cash movement (increase) of the consideration payable. The increase of EUR 51.6 million 
in the consideration resulted from the improved actual level of profitability  of Signet, 
compared with the assumptions used in the previous fair value determination. This 
increase is accounted through retained earnings. Payment of the consideration for the 
remaining 30% was effected  on 1 February 2024. Reference is made to Note 7and Note 27.

2023 2022
Discount rate as at 31 December 3.48% 4.03%
Future salary increases 1.57% 1.66%
Future pension increases 1.20% 1.30%
Price inflation 2.02% 2.09%
Assumptions regarding future mortality are based on published statistics and mortality 
tables. The following tables have been used:
• The Netherlands: AGPrognose2022Hoog 7 based on income class high-middle
• The United Kingdom: before retirement – as per post retirement, after 
retirement:   S3PXA_L CMI 2022 model [1.25%]
• Canada: CPM 2014 Public & Private with 2D projections using Scale B
• Germany: Richttafel 2018G Klaus Heubeck;
• Switzerland: BVG 2020 Generational
The Group expects EUR 3.556 thousand in contributions to be paid to its defined  benefit  
plans in 2024. The Canadian pension plans are partially unfunded. The duration of the 
funded obligation based on expected cash flows  is 11 years, the unfunded plans have an 
expected duration of 12 years.
Sensitivity analysis
The defined  benefit  plans in Austria, Germany, the Philippines, The United States relate 
to a limited number of (retired) employees. For that reason, sensitivity analyses for these 
plans are not provided. The four significant  defined  benefit  plans are the schemes in The 
Netherlands, The United Kingdom, Switzerland and Canada.
The plan in the Netherlands was an average salary defined  benefit  plan until 31 December 
2016. The plan is financed  through an insurance policy. There are no specific  material 
entity risks to which the plan is exposed and the plan assets are not invested in a single 
class of investments. From 2016 onwards no additional retirement benefits  accrue in the 
defined  benefit  plan. The retirement benefits  related to employee services in 2017 and 
onwards accrued in a new pension plan, effective  from 1 January 2017. As a result of the 
parameters in the new pension contract, it classifies  as a defined  contribution plan.
The plan in the United Kingdom has 29 members and is a final  salary defined  benefit  plan. 
The plan is financed  through a pension fund. The plan assets are not invested in a single 
class of investments.

Integrated Report 2023
The plan in Canada consists of three separate plans: a pension and supplementary 
retirement pension plan for certain (former) executive members (9 members) and a non-
pension post-retirement benefit  plan providing extended health, dental, life insurance and 
accidental death and dismemberment benefits.   The supplementary plan and non-pension 
plan are unfunded.
The pension plans of IMCD Switzerland were revised and harmonised due to the merger 
between IMCD Switzerland AG and DCS Pharma AG. The revised plan was put in to effect  
as at 1 January 2022. The plan is financed  through a pension fund and the plan assets are 
not invested in a single class of investments.
The obligations arising from the defined  benefit  plans mentioned above are determined 
using the projected unit credit method. The projected unit credit method determines the 
expected benefits  to be paid after retirement, taking dynamic measurement parameters 
into account and spreading them over the entire length of service of the employees 
participating in the plan. For this purpose, an actuarial valuation is obtained every year. 
The actuarial assumptions for the discount rate, salary growth rate, pension trend and life 
expectancy, which are used to calculate the defined  benefit  obligation are established on 
the basis of the respective economic circumstances.
The plan assets measured at fair value are deducted from the present value of the defined  
benefit  obligation (gross pension obligation). Plan assets are assets where the claim to said 
assets has, in principle, been assigned to the beneficiaries.  This results in a net liability or a 
net asset to be recognized.
Reasonably possible changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial 
assumptions, holding other assumptions constant, would have affected  the defined  
benefit  obligations of the three significant  defined  benefit  plans by the amounts 
shown below:

Although the analysis does not take account of the full distribution of cash flows  
expected under the plan, it does provide an approximation of the sensitivity of the 
assumptions shown.
Termination benefits and other long-term employee benefits
The movements in the termination benefits  and other long-term employee benefits  are

Financial instruments measured at fair value
Type Valuation technique Significant  unobservable
inputs
Inter-relationship between significant  
unobservable inputs and fair 
value measurement
Contingent consideration Discounted cash flows:  The valuation model considers the present value of expected payment, 
discounted using a risk-adjusted discount rate. The expected payment is determined by 
considering the possible scenarios of forecast EBITDA, the amount to be paid under each 
scenario and the probability of each scenario.
• Forecast EBITDA margin
• Risk-adjusted discount rate
The estimated fair value would increase/
(decrease) if:
• the EBITDA margins were higher/
(lower); or
• the risk-adjusted discount rates were 
lower/(higher).
Forward exchange contracts 
and interest rate swaps
Market comparison technique: The fair values are based on broker quotes. Similar contracts are 
traded in an active market and the quotes reflect  the actual transactions in similar instruments.
Not applicable Not applicable
Financial instruments not measured at fair value
There were no financial  instruments that are measured at amortised cost but for which fair 
value was disclosed classified  as Level 3 either in the current year or in the prior year.

main fair value adjustments in 2023 relate to a reduction in the estimated deferred 
consideration, consisting of Sanrise (China) of EUR 15.6 million and Megasetia (Indonesia) 
of EUR 12.0 million. The reductions are the consequence of the actual lower level of 
profitability  of the acquired entities, compared with the assumptions used in the previous 
fair value determination.
Sensitivity analysis
The fair value of contingent considerations is subject to two principal assumptions. The 
effects  of reasonable changes to these assumptions, keeping other assumptions constant, 
are set out below.

Claims
The Group is a party to a limited number of legal proceedings incidental to its business. 
As is the case with other companies in similar industries, the Company faces exposures 
from actual or potential claims and legal proceedings. Although the ultimate result of 
legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of the Company’s 
management that the outcome of any claim which is pending or threatened, either 
individually or on a combined basis and considering the insurance cover available, will 
not have a material effect  on the financial  position of the Company, its cash flows  and 
result of operations.
In our Annual Report 2022, IMCD reported on a class action lawsuit including PT Megasetia 
Agung Kimia (''Megasetia'') in Indonesia and its revoked license. On 21 June 2023, 
Megasetia was removed from the lawsuit and is no longer one of the defendants. On 
6 December 2023, Megasetia regained its license to distribute pharmaceuticals materials.

37  General
The company financial  statements are part of the 2023 financial  statements of IMCD N.V. 
(the ‘Company’).
38 Principles for the measurement of assets and liabilities and 
the determination of the result
For setting the principles for the recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities and 
determination of the result for its company financial  statements, the Company makes 
use of the option provided in Section 2:362 (8) of the Netherlands Civil Code. This 
means that the principles for the recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities 
and determination of the result (hereinafter referred to as principles for recognition 
and measurement) of the company financial  statements of the Company are the same 
as those applied for the consolidated EU-IFRS financial  statements. These consolidated 
EU-IFRS financial  statements are prepared according to the standards laid down by 
the International Accounting Standards Board and endorsed by the European Union 
(hereinafter referred to as EU-IFRS). Reference is made to the notes to the consolidated 
financial  statements.
Participating interests are valued on the basis of the equity method.
The share in results from participating interests, after taxation consists of the share of the 
Company in the results of these participating interests. Results on transactions, where the 
transfer of assets and liabilities is between the Company and its participating interests and 
mutually between participating interests themselves, are not incorporated insofar as they 
can be deemed to be unrealised.
39 Operating income
Other operating income predominantly relates to management service fees charged to 
IMCD Group B.V.
40 Personnel expenses
The personnel expenses 2023 comprise the wages and salaries including bonuses, cost 
related to the employee benefit  plan and social security expenses. Further details are 
provided in Note 53.
By the end of 2023, the Company had 3 employees (3 FTE's) and the average number of 
employees in 2023 was 2. All 3 employees reside in the Netherlands.
41 Income tax expenses
The reconciliation between the Company's domestic income tax rate and related tax 
charge and the effective  income tax rate and related effective  income tax charge is 
as follows:
Reconciliation effective  tax rate

On 15 December 2023, IMCD signed an agreement to acquire 100% of the shares of 
Valuetree Ingredients Private Limited ("Valuetree") to expand its beauty and personal care 
footprint in India. Valuetree employs a team of 44 employees and generated a revenue 
of approximately INR 4.4 billion (ca. EUR 48 million) in the financial  year that ended 
on March 31, 2023. The transaction will take place in two tranches. On 9 January 2024, 
IMCD acquired 70% of the share capital from the founders and the remaining 30% will be 
acquired in 2025.
In December 2023, IMCD exercised a call option to acquire the remaining 30% of the 
shares from the minority shareholders of Signet, The completion of the acquisition of 
the remaining 30% interest was executed on the basis of the share purchase agreement 
of September 2020. As IMCD obtained full control over Signet as per November 2020, 
this purchase price obligation was included in IMCD’s reported net debt position and 
results of Signet are consolidated in full into the IMCD figures  since the November 2020 
acquisition date. As a result, this completion, as such, will not impact the reported leverage 
or earnings levels of IMCD. Payment of the consideration for the remaining 30% of the 
shares in Signet was effected  on 1 February 2024.
On 16 February 2024, IMCD signed an agreement to acquire the business of the 
speciality distribution company ResChem Technologies Pty Ltd and ResChem Trust in 
Australia and New Zealand ("ResChem"). Established in 2007, ResChem specialises in 
resins, additives and pigments for use in inks, coatings, adhesives and construction 
applications. ResChem represents leading global suppliers which are complementary to 
IMCD's portfolio. ResChem is headquartered in Sydney, Australia, generated a revenue 
of approximately AUD 25 million (ca. EUR 15 million) in 2023 with 15 employees and 
strengthens IMCD's technical expertise with an application laboratory based in Sydney. The 
closing of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to 
take place in the second quarter of 2024.
Apart from the aforementioned transactions, there were no material events after 
31 December 2023 that would have changed the judgement and analysis by management 
of the financial  condition at 31 December 2023 or the result for the year of the Company.

Independent auditor's report
To the Shareholders and the Supervisory Board of IMCD N.V.,
Report on the audit of the financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2023 included in the Integrated Report
Our opinion
We have audited the financial  statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 of 
IMCD N.V. (“the Company”), based in Rotterdam. The financial  statements comprise the 
consolidated financial  statements and the Company financial  statements.
In our opinion:
• The accompanying consolidated financial  statements give a true and fair view of the 
financial  position of IMCD N.V. as at 31 December 2023, and of its result and its cash 
flows  for the year ended 31 December 2023 in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EU-IFRS) and with Part 9 of 
Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
• The accompanying Company financial  statements give a true and fair view of the 
financial  position of IMCD N.V. as at 31 December 2023, and of its result for the year 
ended 31 December 2023 in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.              
     The consolidated financial  statements comprise:
1. The consolidated statement of financial  position as at 31 December 2023.
2. The following statements for the year ended 31 December 2023: the consolidated 
statements of profit  or loss and other comprehensive income, the consolidated 
statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows. 
3. The notes comprising material accounting policy information and other 
explanatory information.
The Company financial  statements comprise:
1. The Company balance sheet as at 31 December 2023.
2. The Company income statement for the year ended 31 December 2023.
3. The notes comprising a summary of the accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.
Basis for our opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards 
on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 'Our 
responsibilities for the audit of the financial  statements' section of our report.
We are independent of IMCD N.V. in accordance with the EU Regulation on specific  
requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities, the Wet toezicht 
accountantsorganisaties (Wta, Audit firms  supervision act), the Verordening inzake de 
onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten (ViO, Code of Ethics for 
Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant 
independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the 
Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics).
We believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient  and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion.
Information in support of our opinion
We designed our audit procedures in the context of our audit of the financial  statements 
as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon. The following information in support of 
our opinion was addressed in this context, and we do not provide a separate opinion or 
conclusion on these matters.
Materiality
Based on our professional judgement we determined the materiality for the financial  
statements as a whole at €28 million (2022: €30 million). The materiality is based on 
7% (2022: 7%) of result before income tax excluding non-recurring items. We have also 
taken into account misstatements and/or possible misstatements that in our opinion are 
material for the users of the financial  statements for qualitative reasons.
Component audits are performed using materiality levels determined by the judgement of 
the group audit team, considering materiality for the consolidated financial  statements as 
a whole and the reporting structure for the group. Component materialities did not exceed 
€13.4 million.
We agreed with the Supervisory Board that misstatements in excess of € 1.4 million, 
which are identified  during the audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller 
misstatements that in our view must be reported on qualitative grounds.

Integrated Report 2023
Scope of the group audit
IMCD N.V. is at the head of a group of entities. The financial  information of this group is 
included in the consolidated financial  statements of IMCD N.V.
As we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are directing, supervising and 
performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and extent 
of the audit procedures to be carried out for components. The extent of the procedures 
has been determined based on the financial  significance  of components and a number 
of qualitative considerations such as the maturity of markets these components are 
operating in.
We selected 10 components for full audit scope and 19 components for audit of specified  
account balances and/or transactions. For the remaining components we have carried 
out analytical review procedures on the component financial  information. None of the 
components for which we performed analytical review procedures represented more than 
1.9% of total group revenue or total group assets. For those components we performed, 
among others, analytical procedures to corroborate our assessment that there were no 
significant  risks of material misstatement within those components.
The above approach resulted in a coverage of 78% of the total revenue in audit scope and 
a coverage of assets is 83% in audit scope.
We have used the work of component audit teams for all component entities in scope (full 
audit scope and audit of specified  account balances and/or transactions). The group audit 
team provided detailed written instructions to all component auditors to communicate 
requirements and significant  audit areas and (fraud) risks related to management override 
of controls. Furthermore, we developed a plan for overseeing each component audit team 
based on its relative significance  to the group and other risk characteristics. Our oversight 
included regular update meetings, performing file  reviews, performing on-site visits in the 
US, Mexico, the UK, Indonesia and China, attending management closing meetings and 
reviewing component audit team deliverables.
We have performed audit procedures ourselves at IMCD N.V. corporate entities and 
operations in the Netherlands. Among others we have assessed group-wide internal 
controls that have been implemented by the Management Board to monitor and 
manage the financial  and operating performance of the various operating segments. 
Furthermore, the group audit team performed audit procedures on the consolidation, 
the IT environment, impairment testing for goodwill and impairment (trigger) testing for 
supplier relations, purchase price allocation of acquisitions, sales and cost of goods sold 
for entities using the centralized IT system, loans and borrowings and designed the testing 
approach of manual journal entries. Specialists were involved amost others in the areas of 
valuations, information technology, forensics, accounting and tax.
By performing the procedures mentioned above at group entities, together with additional 
procedures at group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient  and appropriate 
audit evidence about the group's financial  information to provide an opinion on the 
consolidated financial  statements.

Integrated Report 2023
Audit approach fraud risks
In accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, we are responsible for obtaining 
reasonable assurance that the financial  statements taken as a whole are free from 
material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.
Inherent to our responsibilities for the audit of the financial  statements, there is an 
unavoidable risk that material misstatements go undetected, even though the audit is 
planned and performed in accordance with Dutch law.
The risk of undetected material misstatements due to fraud is even higher, as fraud may 
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control. Also, we are not responsible for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
non-compliance with all laws and regulations. Our audit procedures differ  from a forensic 
or legal investigation, which often have a more in-depth character.
We identified  and assessed the risks of material misstatements of the financial  statements 
due to fraud. During our audit we obtained an understanding of the entity and its 
environment and the components of the system of internal control, including the risk 
assessment process and management's process for responding to the risks of fraud 
and monitoring the system of internal control and how the Supervisory Board exercises 
oversight, as well as the outcomes. We refer to section Risk factors and risk management 
of the Integrated Report for management's (fraud) risk assessment and section Audit 
Committee of the Supervisory Board report in which the Supervisory Board reflects  on 
this (fraud) risk assessment.
We evaluated the design and relevant aspects of the system of internal control and 
in particular the fraud risk assessment, as well as among other the code of conduct, 
whistle blower procedures and incident registration. We evaluated the design and the 
implementation of internal controls designed to mitigate fraud risks.
As part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors with 
respect to financial  reporting fraud, misappropriation of assets and bribery and corruption 
in close co-operation with our forensic specialists. We evaluated whether these factors 
indicate that a risk of material misstatement due to fraud is present.
Following these procedures, and the presumed risks under the prevailing audit standards, 
we considered fraud risks related to management override of controls. Our audit 
procedures to respond to these fraud risks include, amongst others, an evaluation of 
relevant internal controls and supplementary substantive audit procedures, including 
detailed testing of journal entries and post-closing adjustments based on supporting 
documentation. Data analytics, including selection of journal entries based on risk-based 
characteristics, form part of our audit approach to address the identified  fraud risks.
We performed the following specific  procedures related to the identified  fraud risks:
• We incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit. We also considered the 
outcome of our other audit procedures and evaluated whether any findings  were 
indicative of fraud or non-compliance.
• We considered available information and made enquiries of the Management Board 
and the Supervisory Board.
• We have had a central fraud brainstorm session with the component auditors and our 
forensic specialists and evaluated which fraud risks were present. We worked closely 
with the forensic specialists when any new fraud indications were identified. 
• In case of any fraud indications, we have had close co-operation with our forensic 
specialists to determine the appropriate.
We tested the appropriateness of journal entries recorded in the general ledger and 
other adjustments made in the preparation of the financial  statements.
• We evaluated whether the selection and application of accounting policies by the entity, 
particularly those related to subjective measurements and complex transactions, may 
be indicative of fraudulent financial  reporting.
• We evaluated whether the judgments and decisions made by management in making 
the accounting estimates included in the financial  statements indicate a possible bias 
that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. Management insights, 
estimates and assumptions that might have a major impact on the financial  statements 
are disclosed in Note 2 of the financial  statements. We performed a retrospective 
review of management judgments and assumptions related to significant  accounting 
estimates reflected  in prior year financial  statements.
Certain management estimates and judgments are considered most significant  to our 
audit. Reference is made to the section 'Our key audit matters' for further details on 
those estimates.
For significant  transactions such as various business combinations during the year, 
we evaluated whether the business rationale of the transactions suggests that they 
may have been entered into to engage in fraudulent financial  reporting or to conceal 
misappropriation of assets.
This did not lead to indications for fraud potentially resulting in material misstatements.

Integrated Report 2023
Audit approach compliance with laws and regulations
We assessed the laws and regulations relevant to the entity through discussion with 
amongst others, management, corporate general counsel and those charged with 
governance, reading minutes of board meetings, and reading reports of internal audit.
As a result of our risk assessment procedures, and while realizing that the effects  
from non-compliance could considerably vary, we considered the following laws and 
regulations: (corporate) tax law, the requirements under the International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EU-IFRS) and Part 9 of Book 2 
of the Dutch Civil Code with a direct effect  on the financial  statements as an integrated 
part of our audit procedures, to the extent material for the financial  statements.
We obtained sufficient  appropriate audit evidence regarding provisions of those laws and 
regulations generally recognized to have a direct effect  on the financial  statements.
Apart from these, IMCD N.V. is subject to other laws and regulations where the 
consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect  on amounts and/or 
disclosures in the financial  statements, for instance, through imposing fines  or litigation.
Given the nature of IMCD N.V.’s business, we considered the risk of non-compliance in the 
areas of health, safety, environment and quality (HSEQ), data protection, tax and other 
applicable laws and regulations. In addition, we considered major laws and regulations 
applicable to listed companies.     
Our procedures are more limited with respect to these laws and regulations that do 
not have a direct effect  on the determination of the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial  statements. Compliance with these laws and regulations may be fundamental 
to the operating aspects of the business, to IMCD N.V.’s ability to continue its business, 
or to avoid material penalties (e.g., compliance with the terms of operating licenses and 
permits or compliance with environmental regulations) and therefore non-compliance 
with such laws and regulations may have a material effect  on the financial  statements. 
Our responsibility is limited to undertaking specified  audit procedures to help identify 
non-compliance with those laws and regulations that may have a material effect  on the 
financial  statements.
Our procedures are limited to (i) inquiry of management, the Supervisory Board, the 
Executive Board and others within IMCD N.V. as to whether the entity is in compliance 
with such laws and regulations and (ii) inspecting correspondence, if any, with the relevant 
licensing or regulatory authorities to help identify non-compliance with those laws and 
regulations that may have a material effect  on the financial  statements.
Naturally, we remained alert to indications of (suspected) non-compliance throughout 
the audit.
Finally, we obtained written representations that all known instances of (suspected) fraud 
or non-compliance with laws and regulations have been disclosed to us.
Audit approach going concern
Our responsibilities, as well as the responsibilities of the Management Board and the 
Supervisory Board, related to going concern under the prevailing standards are outlined 
in the “Description of responsibilities regarding the financial  statements” section below. In 
fulfilling  our responsibilities, we performed procedures including evaluating management’s 
assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and considering the 
impact of financial,  operational, and other conditions. Based on these procedures, we 
did not identify any reportable findings  related to the entity’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
Our key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most 
significance  in our audit of the financial  statements. We have communicated the key 
audit matters to the Supervisory Board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive 
reflection  of all matters discussed.
In determining our key audit matters, we have reconsidered those included in the previous 
years and whether these are still relevant for the current year. Furthermore, we have 
evaluated whether new key audit matters should be included as well based on current 
year considerations. Below identified  key audit matters were addressed in the context of 
our audit of the financial  statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and 
we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Impairment of goodwill and supplier relations – Refer to Note 18 of the 
financial  statements
IMCD N.V. (“IMCD”) grows its business organically and through acquisitions. 
As a result of these acquisitions, the balance sheet as at December 31, 2023 
carries goodwill of €1,612 million and supplier relations of €592 million. In 
2023, goodwill and supplier relations increased 16.6% due to acquisitions, with 
the acquisition of Sanrise Industries & Development Co., Ltd., O&3 Limited, 
Sachs Chemical Inc. and Brylchem Group (see key audit matter ‘Business 
Combinations’) being the most substantial ones for the year.
For purposes of impairment testing, IMCD allocates goodwill to three cash-
generating units (CGUs). Supplier relations are grouped to the smallest CGUs. 
For goodwill, IMCD tests its CGUs annually and upon the existence of a 
triggering event, by comparing the recoverable amounts of the individual 
CGUs, being the higher of value-in-use and fair value less cost of disposal, to 
the carrying amounts in accordance with IAS 36. For supplier relations, the 
recoverable amounts are assessed upon the existence of a triggering event 
since these are definite  life time assets. No triggering event was identified  
during FY 2023. IMCD discloses the key assumptions used in determining the 
recoverable amounts and the sensitivity of the impairment test for changes in 
those assumptions in Note 18 of the financial  statements.
We identified  the risk of impairment of goodwill and supplier relations as 
a key audit matter because of the amounts involved, the complexity of the 
assessment process and the significance  of management estimates for key 
assumptions used, including projections of future cash flows,  discount rates 
and (terminal) growth rates. In addition, macro-economic developments related 
to inflation  and interest rates are adding uncertainty to the projection of these 
key assumptions.
.
As part of our audit, we conducted a risk assessment by identifying and assessing risk of material misstatements for each 
of the CGUs. We also evaluated the historical accuracy of budgeting and the sensitivities in management estimates for key 
assumptions, including projections of future cash flows,  discount rates and long term growth rates. We focused our substantive 
audit procedures on the assumptions to which the value in use is most sensitive and for which a change could potentially cause 
a material decline in headroom and trigger an impairment.
We obtained an understanding of management’s process over the impairment test and the impairment trigger test.
We verified  whether projections were based on internal budgets and financial  plans approved by the Supervisory Board. 
Furthermore, we challenged and compared revenue projections to, for example, external economic outlook data and expected 
inflation  rates in which we focused on those estimates that could cause a change in the outcome of impairment testing.
With the involvement of Deloitte valuation experts, we evaluated the appropriateness and accuracy of the impairment models 
used by IMCD, the discount rates and long term growth rates applied and compared the methodology and outcomes to 
relevant industry and capital market information. Additionally, we assessed the various scenarios applied in impairment 
testing as disclosed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial  statements in view of the current market conditions, trends in 
financial  performance and the uncertainty around recovery of the industries in which IMCD operates in view of the current 
economic developments.
Key observations
Within the context of our audit on the financial  statements as a whole and based on the materiality applied, we have no 
observations regarding the assumptions used in the impairment calculations. Furthermore, we have no observations regarding 
the disclosure (Note 18 to the consolidated financial  statements) of the sensitivity of the impairment test to changes in the most 
critical assumptions used.

Business combinations and related deferred considerations – Refer to 
Note 7 and 29 of the consolidated financial  statements
IMCD N.V. (“IMCD”) completed 13 business combinations throughout the year. 
The largest acquisitions were Sanrise Industries & Development Co., Ltd., O&3 
Limited, Sachs Chemical Inc. and Brylchem Group. IFRS 3 requires management 
to determine the fair value of identified  assets and liabilities and to determine 
the resulting goodwill and supplier relations to be recognized, along with 
any applicable deferred consideration. This requires management to apply 
judgement and to use assumptions at initial recognition and to measure any 
subsequent changes in deferred considerations.
Business combinations in 2023 resulted in a total increase of goodwill, other 
intangible assets and deferred considerations by €253 million, €172 million 
and €87 million, respectively. We identified  the allocation of the purchase price 
and the valuation of these assets to be an audit area of focus considering the 
amounts involved, prevailing uncertainties in global economies and the extent 
of management judgement involved to estimate the fair values of assets and 
assumptions such as the discount rate, attrition rate and (terminal) growth rate.
For deferred considerations classified  as financial  liabilities as of December 
31, 2023, the change in fair value after the previous determination resulted 
in a net finance  cost of €31 million. The completion and exercise of the call 
and put option for the remaining 30% interest in Signet Excipients Private Ltd 
(“Signet") in December 2023 resulted in a reclassification  to current liabilities 
and a change in equity of €52 million following improved levels of profitability  
in comparison to the previous fair value determination. We identified  the 
accounting for deferred considerations and any subsequent changes therein 
up to completion and exercise of any call and put option to be an audit area of 
focus considering the extent of management judgment involved.
The Management Board of IMCD engaged a valuation expert to assist them in performing the purchase price allocations for 
the acquisitions of Sanrise Industries & Development Co., Ltd., O&3 Limited, Sachs Chemical Inc. and Brylchem Group. We 
evaluated competence and objectivity of the management’s expert and used their work in our audit. We also obtained an 
understanding of management’s process and controls over their assessment and performed testing on the reliability of the key 
assumptions used in the purchase price allocation, data and outputs used by the management expert. 
Furthermore, we performed substantive audit procedures on the purchase price allocation. We evaluated whether the 
preparation of the purchase price allocation was in line with IFRS 3. We inspected the Share Purchase Agreement and other 
relevant legal documents, evaluated management’s identification  of assets and liabilities acquired, tested the reliability of data 
used and challenged management’s key assumptions in determining the fair value of the supplier relations.
For a certain business combination, we involved a Deloitte valuation expert to help us evaluate the work prepared by 
the management’s expert in terms of appropriateness and accuracy of the models used, discount rates/ growth rates/ 
attrition rates applied and benchmark certain assumptions (including cash flow  projections). In addition, we validated the 
appropriateness and completeness of disclosures related to IMCD’s acquisitions, as included in Note 7 to the consolidated 
financial  statements.
We obtained management’s assessment for the (re)measurement of deferred considerations. We evaluated the measurement 
of deferred considerations and changes therein based on the agreed price mechanism and an assessment of relevant business 
assumptions. For exercised options we have assessed the accounting treatment, reconciled the amounts to the agreed 
option value calculation and, if settled, reconciled payments to the respective bankstatement. Lastly, we have assessed the 
appropriateness and sufficiency  of the related disclosures in the Integrated Report as disclosed in Note 7 and 29 to the 
consolidated financial  statements.
Key observations
Based on our materiality and procedures performed and in the context of the audit of the consolidated financial  statements 
as a whole, we have no observations regarding management’s application of IFRS 3 for the recognition and valuation of 
assets and liabilities resulting from the allocation of purchase prices for the business combinations completed in 2023. In 
addition, we have no observations regarding the accounting for deferred considerations and any subsequent changes therein. 
The business combinations and deferred considerations are appropriately disclosed in Note 7 and 29 to the consolidated 
financial  statements.

Report on the other information included in the Integrated Report
In addition to the financial  statements and our auditor's report thereon, the Integrated 
report contain other information that consists of:
• Report of the Management Board.
• Other Information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
• Other information included in the Integrated Report.
Based on the following procedures performed, we conclude that the other information:
• Is consistent with the financial  statements and does not contain 
material misstatements.
• Contains all the information regarding the management report and the other 
information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained 
through our audit of the financial  statements or otherwise, we have considered whether 
the other information contains material misstatements.
By performing these procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 
2 of the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of the procedures 
performed is substantially less than the scope of those performed in our audit of the

Management is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including report 
of the Management Board in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, and 
the other information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements and ESEF
Engagement
We were engaged by the Supervisory Board as auditor of IMCD N.V. on June 14, 2023, as of 
the audit for the year 2023. Since 2016, we have operated as statutory auditor.
No prohibited non-audit services
We have not provided prohibited non-audit services as referred to in Article 5(1) of the EU 
Regulation on specific  requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities.
European Single Electronic Format (ESEF)
IMCD N.V. has prepared its Integrated Report in ESEF. The requirements for this are set out 
in the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 with regard to regulatory technical standards on 
the specification  of a single electronic reporting format (hereinafter: the RTS on ESEF).
In our opinion, the Integrated Report, prepared in XHTML format, including the (partly) 
marked-up consolidated financial  statements, as included in the reporting package by 
IMCD N.V. complies in all material respects with the RTS on ESEF.
Management is responsible for preparing the Integrated Report including the financial  
statements in accordance with the RTS on ESEF, whereby management combines the 
various components into one single reporting package.
Our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance for our opinion whether the 
Integrated Report in this reporting package complies with the RTS on ESEF.
We performed our examination in accordance with Dutch law, including Dutch Standard 
3950N 'Assurance-opdrachten inzake het voldoen aan de criteria voor het opstellen van 
een digitaal verantwoordingsdocument' (assurance engagements relating to compliance 
with criteria for digital reporting).
Our examination included amongst others:
• Obtaining an understanding of the company's financial  reporting process, including the 
preparation of the reporting package.
• Identifying and assessing the risks that the Integrated Report does not comply in all 
material respects with the RTS on ESEF and designing and performing further assurance 
procedures responsive to those risks to provide a basis for our opinion, including:
- obtaining the reporting package and performing validations to determine whether

Description of responsibilities regarding the financial statements
Responsibilities of Management and the Supervisory Board for the 
financial statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial  
statements in accordance with EU-IFRS and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. 
Furthermore, management is responsible for such internal control as management 
determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial  statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
As part of the preparation of the financial  statements, management is responsible for 
assessing the company's ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial  
reporting frameworks mentioned, management should prepare the financial  statements 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate 
the company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Management should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant  doubt on 
the company's ability to continue as a going concern in the financial  statements.
The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the company's financial  
reporting process.
Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objective is to plan and perform the audit assignment in a manner that allows us to 
obtain sufficient  and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion.
Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which 
means we may not detect all material errors and fraud during our audit.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence  the economic decisions 
of users taken on the basis of these financial  statements. The materiality affects  the 
nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect  of 
identified  misstatements on our opinion.
We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism 
throughout the audit, in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical 
requirements and independence requirements. Our audit included among others:
• Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial  statements, 
whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive 
to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient  and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
• Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness  of the company's internal control.
• Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
• Concluding on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of 
accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant  doubt on the company's 
ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in 
the financial  statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our 
auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease 
to continue as a going concern.
• Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial  statements, 
including the disclosures.
• Evaluating whether the financial  statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for 
directing, supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined 
the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group entities. Decisive 
were the size and/or the risk profile  of the group entities or operations. On this basis, we 
selected group entities for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete 
set of financial  information or specific  items.
We communicate with the Supervisory Board regarding, among other matters, the planned 
scope and timing of the audit and significant  audit findings,  including any significant  
findings  in internal control that we identified  during our audit. In this respect we also 
submit an additional report to the Audit Committee in accordance with Article 11 of the

Integrated Report 2023
Limited assurance report of the independent auditor on IMCD N.V.'s 
sustainability information
To the Shareholders and the Supervisory Board of IMCD N.V.
Our conclusion
We have performed a limited assurance engagement on the sustainability information as 
included in the chapter “Sustainability Statements” in the accompanying integrated report 
(“the Report”) for the year 2023 of IMCD N.V. (“the Company” or “IMCD”) at Rotterdam. A 
review is aimed at obtaining a limited level of assurance.
Based on the procedures performed and the assurance information obtained, nothing has 
come to our attention that causes us to believe that the sustainability information does not 
present, in all material respects, a reliable and adequate view of:
• The policy and business operations with regard to the Sustainability Information 
presented; and
• The business operations, events and achievements in that area in 2023.        
In accordance with the applicable criteria as included in the ‘Reporting Criteria’ section of 
our report.
Our scope is limited to the sustainability information included in the chapter “Sustainability 
Statements” on page 115-178 of the integrated report.
Basis for our conclusion
We have performed our review of the sustainability information in accordance 
with Dutch law, including Dutch Standard 3810N ‘Assurance-opdrachten inzake 
duurzaamheidsverslaggeving ’ (Assurance engagements relating to sustainability reports). 
Our responsibilities under this standard are further described in the section ‘Our 
responsibilities for the review of the sustainability information’ of our report.
We are independent of IMCD N.V. in accordance with the ‘Verordening inzake de 
onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten’ (ViO, Code of Ethics 
for professional accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other 
relevant independence regulations in The Netherlands. This includes that we do not 
perform any activities that could result in a conflict  of interest with our independent 
assurance engagement. Furthermore, we have complied with the ‘Verordening gedrags- en 
beroepsregels accountants’ (VGBA, Dutch code of Ethics).
We believe that the assurance evidence we have obtained is sufficient  and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our conclusion.
Reporting Criteria
The reporting criteria used for the preparation of the Sustainability information are the 
Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) and the applied 
supplemental reporting criteria as disclosed in the chapter ‘Methodology’ on page 138-142 
and page 153 of the Integrated Report.
The Sustainability information is prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards. The GRI 
Standards used are listed in the GRI Content Index as disclosed on page 170-177 of the 
Integrated Report.
The comparability of sustainability information between entities and over time may 
be affected  by the absence of a uniform practice on which to draw, to evaluate and 
measure this information. This allows for the application of different,  but acceptable, 
measurement techniques.
Consequently, the sustainability information needs to be read and understood together 
with the reporting criteria applied.
Materiality
Based on our professional judgement we determined materiality levels for each relevant 
sustainability matter. When evaluating our materiality levels, we considered quantitative 
and qualitative aspects as well as the relevance of information for both stakeholders and 
the company.
We agreed with the Supervisory Board that misstatements which are identified  during 
the assurance engagement and which in our view must be reported on quantitative or 
qualitative grounds, would be reported to them.
Scope of the assurance engagement of the group
IMCD N.V. is the parent company of a group of entities. The sustainability information 
incorporates the consolidated information of this group of entities to the extent as 
specified  in the chapter “8 About this report” on page 178 and ‘Methodology’ on page 
138-142 and page 153 of the Integrated Report. .
Our assurance procedures for the assurance engagement of the group consisted of both 
assurance procedures at group level (consolidated) as well as at group components.

Integrated Report 2023
We have determined the scope of our assurance procedures in such a way that we 
performed sufficient  procedures enabling us to provide a conclusion on the Sustainability 
information. We considered, among other things, the management structure of the group, 
the nature of the activities of the group components, the business processes and controls 
and the industry in which the entity operates.
On this basis, we determined the nature and extent of the procedures at component level 
that were necessary to be performed by the group auditor.
Limitations to the scope of our review
The sustainability information includes prospective information such as ambitions, 
strategy, plans, expectations and estimates. Inherent to prospective information, the 
actual future results are uncertain. We do not provide any assurance on the assumptions 
and achievability of prospective information in the sustainability information.
The references to external sources or websites in the Sustainability information are not 
part of the Sustainability information as reviewed by us. We therefore do not provide 
assurance on this information.
Our conclusion is not modified  in respect to these matters.
Corresponding information not assured
The 2019 (base year) CO2 emission data presented in the “Sustainability statements - 
Environmental” table have not been part of an assurance engagement and therefore this 
data and the corresponding sustainability information and the related disclosures are not 
assured. Our conclusion is not modified  in respect of this matter.
Key review matters
Key review matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most 
significance  in our review of the Sustainability information. We have communicated the key 
review matters to the Supervisory Board. The key review matters are not a comprehensive 
reflection  of all matters discussed.
These matters were addressed in the context of our review of the sustainability 
information as a whole and in forming our conclusion thereon, and we do not provide 
a separate conclusion on these matters.
Key review matter
Scope 3 GHG emissions – Refer to page 118, 138-143, 146-147, 167 and 172-173 of the 
Sustainability Statements
IMCD as a global sales, marketing and distribution company outsourced the majority 
of its transport activities to third party distbitutors. The emissions of these third 
party distributors account for IMCD’s Scope 3 GHG emissions. Further, supply chain 
decarbonization is one of the core focus areas under the key pillar ‘Environment’, derived 
from IMCD’s materiality assessment. The Scope 3 GHG emission figures  are based on a 
combination of detailed transactional data on volumes while simultaneously relying on 
estimates for emission factors and assumptions of IMCD’s logistics department.
We identified  Scope 3 GHG emissions as a key review matter because of the importance 
of Supply chain decarbonization in IMCD’s materiality assessment and the significance  of 
the assumptions used in determining Scope 3 GHG emissions. The Scope 3 GHG emissions 
as disclosed by IMCD represent only the emissions originated in transport activities by 
contracted third party logistics service providers.
According to the GRI Standards and the GHG Protocol Scope 3, GHG emissions can 
consist of various other aspects including the processing and use of sold products. IMCD 
acknowledges that the products distributed have the most significant  impact upstream 
and downstream in the supply chain.
IMCD discloses the scope of countries subject to Scope 3 GHG emissions, the relevant 
emission factors and assumptions used in determining the Scope 3 GHG emissions in the 
chapter ‘Methodology’ on page 138-142 (under the headers ‘Other indirect GHG emissions 
(Scope 3)’ and ‘Energy intensity and GHG emissions intensity’) of the Integrated Report.
How the key review matter was addressed in our review
With respect to the third party logistics emissions we have conducted review procedures 
which include obtaining an understanding of the methodology for gathering the necessary 
information of all third party logistic transactional data about the transportation 
assignments. Furthermore, we had inquiries with IMCD’s management to understand the 
methodology and assumptions used for the calculation of scope 3 GHG emissions based 
on the transactional data about the transportation assignments. For the key assumptions 
presented on page 141-142, we performed reconciliations and recalculations for key 
elements. Furthermore, we assessed the narrative disclosure of IMCD regarding the

methodology used and the rationale to exclude certain parts (i.e. processing and use of 
sold products) of the scope 3 GHG emissions set out by GRI and the GHG Protocol.
Observations
Based on the review procedures performed, we obtained an adequate understanding of 
the methods and assumptions used by management, furthermore we have performed 
testing procedures on the Scope 3 emissions and have no findings  to report. We further 
refer to page 141-142 for the key assumptions used for the calculation of scope 3 
GHG emissions.
Responsibilities of the Management board and the Supervisory board for the 
sustainability information
The Management Board is responsible for the preparation of reliable and adequate 
Sustainability information in accordance with the reporting criteria as disclosed in the the 
section ‘8 About this report’, including the identification  of stakeholders and the definition  
of material matters. The Management Board is also responsible for selecting and applying 
the reporting criteria and for determining that these reporting criteria are suitable for 
the legitimate information needs of stakeholders, taking into account applicable law and 
regulations related to reporting. The choices made by the management board regarding 
the scope of the sustainability information and the reporting policy are summarised in 
section ‘7 GRI & SDG Content Index’ and ‘8 About this report’ of the Integrated Report.
Furthermore, the Management Board is also responsible for such internal control as the 
Management Board determines necessary to enable the preparation of the sustainability 
information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the reporting process of IMCD N.V.
Our responsibilities for the review of the sustainability information
Our responsibility is to plan and perform the review in a manner that allows us to obtain 
sufficient  and appropriate evidence for our conclusion.
Our assurance engagement is aimed to obtain a limited level of assurance to determine 
the plausibility of information. The procedures vary in nature and timing from, and are less 
in extent, than for a reasonable assurance engagement. The level of assurance obtained in 
a limited assurance engagement is therefore substantially less than the assurance that is 
obtained when a reasonable assurance engagement is performed.
We apply the ‘Nadere voorschriften kwaliteitssystemen)’ (NVKS, regulations for Quality 
management systems) and accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality 
management including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance 
with ethical requirements, professional standards and other relevant legal and 
regulatory requirements.
Our limited assurance engagement included among others:
• Performing an analysis of the external environment and obtaining an understanding of 
relevant social themes and issues, and the characteristics of the company;
• Evaluating the appropriateness of the reporting criteria used, their consistent 
application and related disclosures in the Sustainability information. This includes the 
evaluation of the results of the stakeholders’ dialogue and the reasonableness of 
estimates made by the Management Board.
• Obtaining an understanding of the reporting processes for the Sustainability 
information, including obtaining a general understanding of internal control relevant 
to our review;
• Identifying areas of the Sustainability information with a higher risk of misleading or 
unbalanced information or material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.
• Designing and performing further assurance procedures aimed at determining the 
plausibility of the Sustainability information responsive to this risk analysis. These 
procedures consisted amongst others of:
- Interviewing management (and/or relevant staff)  at corporate and local level 
responsible for the sustainability strategy, policy and results;
- Interviewing relevant staff  responsible for providing the information and 
consolidating the data in the sustainability information;
- Determining the nature and extent of the review procedures for KPI’s
- Obtaining assurance information that the sustainability information reconciles with 
underlying records of the company;
- Reviewing, on a limited test basis, relevant internal and external documentation;
• Performing an analytical review of the data and trends in the information available at 
corporate level.
• Evaluating the presentation, structure and content of the sustainability information;
• Considering whether the Sustainability information as a whole, including the 
disclosures, reflects  the purpose of the reporting criteria used;

2 Alternative performance measures 
(APMs)
In presenting and discussing the financial  position, 
operating results and net results and cash generation, 
certain Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) are 
used. APMs, also known as non-IFRS measures, are 
financial  metrics used by IMCD management to monitor 
the company's performance and are disclosed to provide 
additional insights into its performance beyond what is 
reported using standard accounting principles.
