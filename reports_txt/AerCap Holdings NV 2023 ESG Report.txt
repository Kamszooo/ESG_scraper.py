A MESSAGE FROM OUR ESG COMMITTEE CHAIR
It's with great pleasure that I present AerCap's seventh annual 
ESG Report, covering the year 2023. As we reflect on our 
journey, marked by two years of dedicated work by our ESG 
board committee and staff, I am proud of the strides we have 
made and excited about the path ahead.
As the leading aviation lessor, AerCap is deeply invested in 
fostering sustainable growth within our industry. We 
recognize aviation's indispensable role in economic 
development, harmonizing international relations and 
facilitating cross-border trade.
The airline industry is faced with increased costs associated 
with funding the cost of decarbonization, such as carbon 
charges (e.g., European-Emission Trading Scheme), and 
higher costs for sustainable aviation fuels. 
Against this backdrop, our ESG Committee convened four 
times during 2023, monitoring the implementation of our work 
program and, in particular, the Company’s preparations to 
comply with the requirements of the recently adopted EU and 
U.S. climate disclosure rules. 
AerCap’s ESG Strategy (approved by AerCap's Board in 
December 2022) remains the foundation of our ESG 
Committee.  We firmly believe that sustainability cannot exist 
in isolation but must be seamlessly integrated into our 
overarching corporate strategy. By identifying areas where 
AerCap can maximize its impact and by proactively 
addressing key risks and opportunities, we aim to drive 
meaningful change within our industry. 
Public ESG and sustainability reporting is becoming more 
broadly expected by lenders, investors, shareholders, and 
other parties. ESG rating agencies provide corporate 
governance and other corporate risk information to investors 
and shareholders. I am pleased that AerCap’s ESG ratings have 
continued to maintain a positive trajectory, as evidenced by 
our upgrade by MSCI ESG Ratings to ‘AA’ or ‘Leader’ level in 
September 2023, and by our upgrade by Morningstar 
Sustainalytics to ‘Low Risk’ level in April 2024. 
Beyond climate concerns, AerCap remains steadfast in its 
commitment to exemplary governance, diversity and 
inclusion, and corporate values. We strive to attract and 
nurture the best talent, leveraging our human capital to deliver 
sustainable returns for stakeholders. Moreover, we endeavor 
to make a positive societal impact commensurate with our 
market leadership position.
Our approach in the year ahead will continue to be twofold: to 
assert control where feasible, and to exert influence where 
necessary. By staying ahead of emerging trends and 
preparing for future challenges, we are confident in our ability 
to lead our industry toward a more sustainable future.
In closing, I extend my gratitude to our dedicated team and 
valued stakeholders for their unwavering support. Together, 
we will continue to chart a course towards a more sustainable 
and prosperous future for AerCap and the aviation industry at 
large.

Dear Stakeholders,

A MESSAGE FROM OUR CEO 
The aviation industry has committed to 
achieving Net-Zero flying by 2050. However, 
the path to reaching this goal is complex. It 
requires a unique level of cooperation across 
the entire aviation ecosystem, including 
airlines, OEMs, lessors, lenders, fuel 
suppliers, and trade associations. 
The activity that currently contributes most to 
decarbonization is fleet renewal, and AerCap 
continues to play a leading role by investing 
in the most fuel-efficient new technology 
aircraft. 
By the end of 2023, ~70% of our owned 
commercial aircraft fleet consisted of new 
technology aircraft on lease to ~80 airlines, 
along with a fleet of ~80% new technology 
engines and an additional ~$18 billion of new 
technology assets on order.1 Since 2014, we 
have invested ~$50 billion in new technology 
aircraft, more than any airline or any other 
lessor. As a result of this investment, our 
Scope 3 emissions intensity has improved, 
generating a 15% reduction in gCO2 per 
seat/km across our entire fleet in the last 
decade despite doubling in size through 
M&A.2  
We have ~300 customers and we directly aid 
our customers’ decarbonization efforts. Many 
airlines lack the financing or delivery slots to 
enable their transition to new technology 
aircraft that produce lower emissions, so 
lessors like AerCap must play a key role. 
More recently, OEM supply chain constraints 
have placed further pressure on airlines’ 
ability to access the most efficient aircraft 
types. 
In that regard, during 2023, AerCap:
• Executed a total of 953 transactions, 
including 592 lease agreements;
• Completed purchases of 173 assets, 
including 80 fuel-efficient, new 
technology owned aircraft, for 
approximately $6.4 billion; and 
• Completed sales of 167 assets for 
aggregate proceeds of approximately 
$2.8 billion, including 74 owned aircraft 
with an average age of 16 years.
Building on fleet renewal, AerCap continues 
to take account of all decarbonization tools 
and regulatory obligations in our efforts to 
support Net-Zero Aviation 2050, including:
• The scale-up of Sustainable Aviation Fuels 
(“SAF”);
• Preparing for EU and U.S. climate-related 
regulatory disclosures;
• Aircraft decommissioning and recycling; 
• Engagement in ESG reporting; and 
• Assessing potential opportunities relating to 
sustainable finance and carbon measures, 
as well as developments relating to future 
disruptive technologies. 
We have continued to build on our Diversity 
and Inclusion (“D&I”) framework and we are 
continuing to make positive strides to 
address the historical underrepresentation of 
women in our industry. I am pleased to report 
that in 2023, 50% of our new hires were 
female. 
Training was made available to all employees 
during 2023 and all relevant corporate 
policies and procedures were reviewed and 
adapted where necessary, to promote 
alignment with the Company’s D&I 
objectives. 
AerCap’s senior leadership team, together 
with the ESG Committee, will continue to 
engage and utilize feedback from employees 
to further develop programs and initiatives 
that support our D&I strategy.
Our Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) 
Committee, led by our employees, 
successfully oversees our charitable 
activities. In 2023, AerCap, together with our 
employees, donated over $800,000 to 
charities and partnerships. 
  - Aengus Kelly, AerCap CEO
See Supplemental Information – Endnotes.
To all our stakeholders, thank you for your ongoing support of AerCap and our sustainability efforts. As always, we welcome your feedback and suggestions 
as we continue to drive aviation to reach new heights and perform at its best.

AerCap’s Board-level 
ESG Committee provides 
oversight of ESG risks 
and opportunities at the highest 
level. In 2023, our Board-level 
ESG Committee met four times. 
ESG factors are a key 
consideration in our Board and 
management’s decision-making 
process
Through our Government Affairs & 
Sustainability function, we had 
continuous interaction with EU, 
U.S., UK, and other bodies on 
policy and decarbonization 
matters.  Dialogue and 
collaboration with regulatory 
policymakers, government bodies, 
industry trade associations and key 
business partners provides AerCap 
with a unique insight to regulatory 
developments; this aids our 
situational awareness and ability to 
influence policy
We continued our corporate fleet 
modernization strategy to ensure 
we own the most in-demand 
aircraft – this also has the benefit of 
contributing to the significant 
reduction of CO2 emissions. 
As of December 31, 2023, AerCap’s 
assets consisted of ~70% new 
technology commercial aircraft and 
~80% new technology engines, 
with an additional ~$18 billion of 
new technology assets on order. 
We have also improved our Scope 
3 emissions intensity, achieving a 
15% reduction in gCO2 per seat/km 
across our entire fleet in the last 
decade
Strong ESG focus highlighted and 
acknowledged by ratings agencies; 
in September 2023, AerCap’s ESG 
rating was upgraded from ‘A’ to 
‘AA’ by MSCI, with strong 
governance a key rating positive 
for the Company, as well as by 
Morningstar Sustainalytics, 
improving from ‘Medium’ to  ‘Low 
Risk’ level in April 2024
AerCap continued to make 
progress on our Diversity, Equity, 
Inclusion and Belonging framework 
and strategy, conducting focus 
groups and training sessions 
throughout 2023 to identify and 
focus on the issues that matter 
most to our employees

RELATED RISKS
Indirect Physical Risks
• The occurrence of severe weather events or natural 
disasters may impact demand for air travel or make 
airlines unable to operate from certain regions, and the 
frequency or severity of these types of events may 
worsen as a result of climate change
• However, due to the mobile nature of our assets and 
our ability to work effectively from various locations, 
we consider direct physical risks to AerCap to be 
limited
Indirect Transition Risks
• Due to growing concerns over the risks of climate 
change, many jurisdictions are moving towards 
imposing more stringent limits on greenhouse gas 
emissions from aircraft engines
• The general public’s increasing interest in less carbon-
intensive travel methods will likely lead to airlines 
favoring aircraft with lower emissions, and airlines may 
choose to exit older technology assets more quickly 
• This may affect lease rates on our older technology 
aircraft and pose’s a risk to their residual values

AERCAP APPROACH
• 99.9% of our total reported emissions in 2023 related to 
Scope 3 downstream use of our owned assets across our 
global fleet. We do not have direct control over these 
emissions, as the assets are operated by our customers, 
and this fact restricts our ability to directly impact the 
quantum of our reported emissions
• In line with our commercial strategy, AerCap’s aircraft fleet 
reached ~70% new technology at the end of 2023 and our 
order book consists of 100% new technology aircraft, 
underpinning our fleet transition strategy towards ~75% 
new technology in 20241
• In 2023, we purchased 80 new technology aircraft, and 
sold 74 older technology aircraft, with an average age of 16 
years, improving the risk profile of our portfolio
• AerCap supports our customers’ fleet renewal plans. Eighty 
of our airline customers now lease new technology aircraft.
• As a lessor of scale, with an installed base of assets with 
~300 customers, we are frequently asked to partner with 
the aircraft OEMs on major campaigns for new technology 
aircraft
• In 2021, the airline members of the International Air 
Transport Association (“IATA”) approved a resolution to 
achieve Net-Zero carbon emissions by 2050. 
Approximately 190 of those airlines are AerCap customers. 
AerCap is enabling their journey through the provision of 
the latest new technology aviation assets
• Through our Government Affairs & Sustainability function, 
we actively engage policymakers and industry on 
regulatory developments across all Net-Zero aviation areas
• AerCap is exploring how to encourage the scale-up of SAF 
to support our customers’ emissions reduction efforts
• AerCap is preparing procedures to meet all EU and U.S. 
climate reporting obligations
• Through AerCap Cargo, we recycle older aircraft by 
placing them into cargo conversion programs, helping our 
cargo customers reduce their emissions
• Through AerCap Materials, we efficiently retire aircraft, 
with strict processes around adherence to environmental 
and safety protocols
• We are engaged with our OEM partners, airlines, and other 
industry players in discussions regarding the design and 
commercialization of the next generation of aircraft and 
engine technology

lenders, investors, shareholders and other stakeholders. Furthermore, 
both the EU and the U.S. have introduced enhanced disclosure regulations 
requiring aircraft lessors to report on various climate-related matters
• Aircraft leasing requires both financial and industrial expertise, so it is 
important to have the correct mix of expertise on the Board of Directors 
• Having operations, assets and customers in many different parts of the 
world requires internationally diverse expertise
• Regulation of aircraft and engine noise and emissions levels are 
increasingly being adopted and can apply based on where the aircraft is 
registered or where the aircraft is operated
• Given that aviation is a hard-to-abate sector, there is a heightened risk of 
being accused of greenwashing
• IT security threats are emerging with growing complexities
• Following the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation

DELIVERING NET-ZERO AVIATION BY 2050
Requires significant intergovernmental and industry collaboration
Collaboration is key
• The airline industry has committed to achieving Net-Zero flying by 2050. 
However, the path to reaching this goal is complex
• Aviation decarbonization faces unique challenges due to weight 
constraints, long innovation cycles, and the relatively high cost of new 
technologies
• The aviation sector’s participants, including airlines, OEMs, and 
suppliers, are highly dependent on one another to achieve Net-Zero 
emissions by 2050
• The investment needed to bring about aviation’s transition to Net-Zero 
by 2050 could be as high as $5 trillion over the period to 2050. The 
annual investments required in that case would be close to $180 billion1
Recent policy and industry developments
• Many countries have continued to develop policies to support the 
delivery of ICAO’s Long-Term Aspirational Goal (“LTAG”) of Net-Zero 
2050
• In October 2023, ReFuelEU was adopted by the EU, including a mandate 
for the supply of SAF at EU airports, and a requirement of at least 6% 
SAF in all jet fuel in 2030, rising to 20% in 2035 and reaching 70% by 
2050, half of which must be eFuel
• ReFuelEU also includes provisions in relation to the establishment of a 
Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (“MRV”) scheme for Non-CO2, 
emissions and the creation of an aviation “eco-label” to transparently 
show passengers their expected emissions on their flights
• The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act provides a tax credit incentive to 
encourage Sustainable Aviation Fuel (“SAF”) production
• In November 2023, the International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”) 
adopted an aspirational  “global vision” to reduce CO2 emissions in 
international aviation by 5% by 2030. This vision will need to be 
achieved through a basket of measures, most importantly a significant 
scaling up of the supply of SAF

IMPORTANCE OF FLEET RENEWAL 
• As indicated by the Air Transport Action Group (“ATAG”), in 
their Waypoint 2050 report, significant CO2 savings will 
continue to materialize in the coming decades through 
continuous fleet renewal with today’s new generation 
aircraft providing immediate 20-25% fuel and CO2 savings 
compared to the previous generation3
• Therefore, during the transitional phase, the renewal of 
aircraft fleets from old, less efficient aircraft types to the 
newest available technology will be essential
• The global commercial aircraft fleet comprises ~25% new 
technology, leaving a ~75% gap to renew the current global 
fleet over the next two decades4
• Prior to the deployment of future technology aircraft at 
commercial scale, industry roadmaps assume that the 
expected growth in the worldwide fleet over the next two 
decades, includes lower-emitting new technology aircraft. 
In that context, through our global leasing business, 
AerCap’s fleet renewal activities play a key role in helping 
the industry to transition to Net-Zero Aviation
• AerCap’s fleet already consists of ~70% new technology 
aircraft and ~80% new technology engine assets, as well as 
an order book comprising of 100% new technology assets5

• In 2021, the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) 
member airlines committed to achieving net-zero carbon 
emissions from their operations by 2050, built around the 
“Fly Net-Zero” framework
• Building on this, in June 2023, “IATA” launched a series of 
Net-Zero roadmaps to guide the aviation industry towards 
achieving Net-Zero2  
• These roadmaps contain a number of solutions including:
• Aircraft Technology
• Energy and New Fuels Infrastructure
• Operations
• Finance
• Policy

AerCap’s Transition to 
New Technology Aircraft
• 2006 – 2013: Orders for the Boeing 787 aircraft, Airbus A350 
aircraft, Airbus A320neo Family aircraft and Embraer E2s
• 2014: Acquired ILFC from AIG, purchasing a fleet of >900 
owned aircraft and an order book of >300 aircraft at a 
discount to book value
• 2015-2021: Orders for the Boeing 737MAX, Boeing 787, 
Airbus A330neo, and Airbus A320neo Family. Furthermore, in 
2021 we acquired GECAS from GE, purchasing a fleet of ~820 
aircraft and an order book of exclusively new technology 
aircraft 
• 2021:  We introduced a new ambitious target of transitioning 
our fleet to ~75% new technology aircraft by the end of 2024 
and we are making progress towards that target
• 2023: We purchased 80 new technology aircraft and sold 74 
older technology aircraft, providing a ~25% gain in efficiency 
in our portfolio and reaching ~70% new technology fleet
• Today:  Our order book of 338 new technology aircraft will 
form the backbone of our future fleet, supporting airlines 
in achieving their sustainability targets5
• In addition, our engine fleet consists of ~80% new 
technology assets, and we have an additional ~$18 billion 
of new technology assets on order
Our ambitious target is for new technology aircraft to comprise ~75% of our aircraft fleet by 2024.1 In 2023, we 
continued our fleet modernization strategy to ensure we own the most in-demand aircraft – this also has the 
benefit of driving a significant reduction in airline CO2 emissions.

Fleet Investment
• While we own many aircraft, we do not 
operate them. However, as the global 
leader in aviation leasing, we feel a sense 
of responsibility to lead the industry 
towards a lower-carbon economy. The 
best way for us to do so is to support our 
airline customers’ adoption of the most 
fuel-efficient aircraft available
• Since 2014, AerCap has invested ~$50 
billion in new technology aircraft.2 This 
investment significantly enhances the 
fuel efficiency of our customers’ fleets, 
reducing their Scope 1 emissions and 
reducing Scope 3 emissions for AerCap. 
In addition, these aircraft significantly 
reduce noise and air pollution
• As a result of our $50 billion investment in 
the latest new technology assets, our 
Scope 3 Emissions intensity has 
improved, generating a 15% reduction in 
gCO2  per seat/km across our entire fleet 
in the last decade 
• As of December 31, 2023, ~70% of our 
owned aircraft fleet and ~80% of our 
engines were new technology assets, on 
lease to ~80 airlines 
• Driven by our order book of 338 new 
technology aircraft, we expect to see a 
further positive impact for our customers 
and for AerCap 
• All of our aircraft are capable of flying 
with up to a 50% blend of SAF and both 
Airbus and Boeing are targeting 2030 for 
100% SAF capability and certification, an 
important step on the path to Net-Zero
FLEET EMISSIONS CARBON INTENSITY REDUCTION
Despite the significant growth of our fleet as a result of the GECAS acquisition, our emissions intensity has continuously im proved due to 
our fleet modernization investment, generating a 15% reduction in emissions per seat/km in the last decade 1

NET-ZERO 2050 - CRITICALITY OF 
SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL
SAF is expected to provide ~65% of emission reductions by 2050 
• SAF is a “drop-in” fuel which, when blended with up to 
50% conventional jet fuel, requires no aircraft 
modifications and is available for use in aircraft and 
helicopters operating today. Airbus, Boeing, and 
Embraer have committed to delivering aircraft that are 
100% SAF capable by 2030
• However, SAF production is still at an early stage, and 
SAF accounts for only 0.2% of all jet fuel in 2023. 
Challenges include the availability of feedstock or green 
electricity, cost, sustainability certification, investment, 
and competing demand from other sectors such as road 
transport
• 43 airlines around the globe have made voluntary SAF 
commitments, corresponding to ~13 Mt of SAF use by 
2030, or ~3.8 % of global aviation jet fuel demand in 
20301
• Global SAF production capacity is expected to increase 
10-fold by the end of the decade, provided projects 
materialize on schedule and producers lock in adequate 
feedstock volumes. It is expected to account for 5% of 
total jet fuel by 20302

NET-ZERO 2050 = “SAF PLUS”…
Beyond SAF there are many other tools to achieve Net-Zero 
• Fleet renewal: New technology 
aircraft are ~20% more efficient. 
~25%  of the global fleet now 
consists of new technology 
aircraft, leaving a 75% gap to 
renew the current global fleet 
over the next two decades, as 
well as ~20% performance 
improvements for all additional 
aircraft growth
• Circular economy: ICAO 
estimates that ~85-90% of an 
aircraft is typically reused or 
recycled. ~40-50% is returned to 
the parts distribution pipeline and 
used again in aircraft 
maintenance, with the remaining 
materials recycled
• EU Reporting: The EU Corporate 
Sustainability Reporting Directive 
(“CSRD”) will require aviation 
businesses to report on their 
climate-related activities and 
transition plans, as well as 
taxonomy-aligned aircraft assets 
• U.S. Reporting: The U.S. SEC 
climate disclosure requirements for 
public companies were adopted in 
March 2024
• Disruptive propulsion & airframe 
technologies: Aircraft and engine 
OEMs are heavily engaged in 
exploring innovative propulsion and 
airframe technologies to reduce 
emissions
Very small and regional aircraft 
(~30-50 seats) will likely be early 
adopters of hydrogen, electrical and 
hybrid systems
The next generation of large 
transport aircraft (~150-200 seats) 
will continue to be combustion fuel-
powered, including SAF, systems 
but with a further step-up in 
efficiency
• Sustainable-linked lending: The 
volume of sustainable finance 
activities with embedded 
sustainable performance targets, is 
steadily rising, mainly between 
banks and airlines
• Lenders: The banking sector has 
developed initiatives in relation to 
sustainable aviation lending, such 
as the Climate Aligned Finance 
“Pegasus Principles” and IMPACT 
for Aviation “Milestone Concept”
The investment needed to bring 
about aviation’s transition to Net -
Zero by 2050 could be as high as 
$5 trillion over the period to 2050
• Direct Air Carbon Capture & 
Storage: Key technology in the 
future to manage aviation 
emissions
• Carbon charges: The EU Emissions 
Trading System (“ETS”) is a cap-
and-trade system for greenhouse 
gas emissions, and includes all 
flights within the EU; airline costs 
are increasing due to the phase-out 
of free ETS allowances. ICAO’s 
Carbon Offsetting and Reduction 
Scheme for International Aviation 
(“CORSIA”) is a global market-
based scheme aimed at reducing 
emissions from international 
aviation. The first phase runs 
between 2024-26

AerCap plays an important role across many of the key decarbonization tools
Fleet renewal is key to our 
core business, and we are 
progressing towards our 
target of ~75% new 
technology commercial 
aircraft by the end of 2024 
(based on NBV)
AerCap Materials has 50+ 
years of experience in aircraft 
dismantling and recycling, 
whilst AerCap Cargo has 25+ 
years’ of Passenger to Freight 
(“P2F”) conversion programs, 
extending the useful life of in-
service aircraft and avoiding 
the environmental impact of 
building new freighters
AerCap is preparing 
procedures to meet all new EU 
and U.S. reporting obligations, 
including the completion of a 
double-materiality assessment
AerCap is playing a leading role 
in key areas such as defining 
the composition of Scope 3 
emissions for lessors and the 
development of taxonomy 
alignment reporting
These activities involve 
significant investments and play 
a key role in creating consistent 
reporting and transparency
This is a steadily evolving area 
with most transactions involving 
lenders with airline customers. 
Recent certainty has come about 
in relation to frameworks such as 
the EU Taxonomy on Sustainable 
Finance and the Pegasus 
Principles 
AerCap seeks to deploy capital in 
the most efficient way possible to 
support our customers and we 
will continue to explore potential 
sustainable finance opportunities 
with our lenders and investors, as 
well as innovative assessment 
mechanisms
Due to our market leadership, 
AerCap has deep relationships 
with our OEM partners and 
continues to engage on airframe 
and engine efficiency gains and 
step changes
AerCap’s focus relates to R&D of 
leading-edge technology that 
can upgrade existing new 
technology aircraft systems as 
well as engine and airframe 
innovations for the next 
generation of large transport 
aircraft
We do not have direct control over 99.9% of our emissions (Scope 3) and believe we must use the levers under our direct control or influence to help 
mitigate these emissions. AerCap is taking account of all decarbonization tools and regulatory obligations in our efforts to support Net-Zero Aviation 2050. 
Our decisions must take account of investor expectations and customer needs, while simultaneously ensuring the best use of capital deployed
To balance our unavoidable 
direct emissions, we contribute 
to an overall reduction in global 
GHG emissions by financing 
carbon reduction/removal 
projects with carbon credits
Carbon Capture technology is in 
its infancy and AerCap has had 
early engagement with leading 
innovators. Carbon as a 
feedstock for eFuel will also 
likely play an important role in 
the future

CIRCULAR ECONOMY AND AVIATION
According to ICAO, ~85-90% of an aircraft is typically reused or recycled. ~40-50% of an aircraft is returned to the parts distribution pipeline 
and used again in aircraft maintenance, with most of the remaining materials recycled and returned to the supply chain as raw materials.  
• AerCap is involved in the whole life of our assets, taking delivery of brand-new aircraft from the
OEMs and remaining involved until those aircraft are disassembled, and their parts returned into 
the supply chain to be used once again
• AerCap Materials has more than 50 years of experience in aircraft dismantling. Its facility is ISO 
certified and Aircraft Fleet Recycling Association (“AFRA”) accredited, helping to ensure that 
aircraft are retired in adherence to strict environmental and safety protocols2
• Proper disassembly of an aircraft in accredited facilities promotes the correct separation of 
different structural materials, which allows them to be recycled and prevents hazardous materials 
from entering the environment

FUNDING OF EMISSIONS REDUCTION PROJECTS 
We support climate action with carbon credits to balance our unavoidable emissions
Notwithstanding the fact our direct emissions (relating to 
Scope 1) and indirect emissions (Scope 2 and Scope 3 business 
travel) are immaterial, we balance these emissions by 
contributing to an overall reduction in GHG emissions by 
financing carbon reduction/removal projects
In 2023, AerCap contributed to reducing GHG emissions by 
purchasing carbon credits equivalent to ~80% of our 
unavoidable direct and indirect emissions for the year 2022, up 
from ~60% the prior year. This amounted to approximately 
3,500 tonnes of CO2
Through our partnership with First Climate, two projects were 
selected. First Climate projects are certified to rigorous 
standards with the goal of making sure that the carbon credits 
are real, measurable, permanent, and third-party verified
We are currently evaluating options for our 2024 Scope 1, 
Scope 2, and Scope 3 Business Travel emissions
Balancing our unavoidable direct emissions 
Renewable wind energy in the district of 
Tiruppur in Tamil Nadu state, India
This project involves the installation and operation of 14 
wind turbines. To harness the favorable wind conditions 
at the southernmost tip of India
The electricity output of the wind farm is sufficient to 
sustainably supply 54,000 homes in India with clean 
electricity
Projects selected for 2023
Afforestation in China - Based in Nanzhou 
County
The project covers 27,380 ha of formerly barren hills and 
wasteland in Henan Province. The project is owned and 
managed by local village collectives from 15 towns within 
the county
The implementation of the project is expected not only to 
achieve reliable and measurable carbon sequestration by 
avoiding commercial logging but will also contribute to 
sustainable development within the project region

Scope 1 & 2 Emissions
Given the nature of the Company’s 
operations and corporate footprint, our 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions are not considered 
material – both from a corporate 
perspective and as a percentage of total 
associated emissions
Our Scope 1 & 2 Emissions combined 
generated <0.01% of our total reported 
emissions in 2023. Nevertheless, we 
endeavour to minimize our impact on the 
environment where it is feasible to do so
To balance our unavoidable direct and 
indirect emissions (relating to Scope 1, 2, 
and Scope 3 business travel), we contribute 
to an overall reduction in GHG emissions by 
financing carbon reduction/removal 
projects (See previous slide)
AerCap’s Scope 1 Emissions are direct 
emissions that stem from natural gas for the 
heating of our offices, our leased car fleet, 
and corporate jet fuel
• 37% reduction in gas consumption across 
AerCap's offices from 2022 to 2023 owing 
to reduced consumption
• 23% reduction in leased car emissions 
from 2022 to 2023, due to an increase in 
fully electric cars in the fleet
AerCap Scope 2 Emissions are comprised 
of indirect emissions related to the 
purchased electricity for our offices
• 49% of our electricity usage across our 
global offices in 2023 was derived from 
renewable sources
• 37% reduction in electricity usage across

Scope 3 Emissions
• Our Scope 3 emissions encompass both owned aircraft and business travel and accounted for 
99.9% of our total reported emissions in 2023. Within that, the vast majority relate to the 
downstream use of owned assets across our global fleet. We do not have direct control over 
these emissions as the assets are operated by our customers, and this fact limits our ability to 
directly impact the quantum of our reported emissions. The addition of emissions relating to 
aircraft purchases, leased engines, and leased helicopters is being considered for future years 
and is dependent on the finalization of an accurate method of calculating these emissions
• AerCap recorded 16% growth in our global Scope 3 Emissions in 2023 compared to 2022, 
which was primarily attributable to the resurgence of traffic in the APAC region post-COVID-
19, largely driven by the reopening of China in 2023. IATA reported that traffic (in RPKs) 
increased by 126% in the APAC region in 2023 compared to 2022. APAC accounted for 34% of 
AerCap’s total lease revenue in 2023

• As a result of our $50 billion investment in new technology assets, our Scope 3 Emissions 
intensity has improved, generating a 15% reduction in gCO2 per Seat/km across our entire fleet 
in the last decade, despite the aircraft fleet doubling in size over this period as a result of the 
GECAS acquisition 
• AerCap's business travel accounted for 0.0156% of its Total Scope 3 emissions in 2023
• In preparation for future climate disclosure reporting requirements, AerCap is currently 
analyzing and refining the composition of Scope 3 emissions, as they pertain to aircraft lessors. 
We are collaborating with the Air Transport Action Group (“ATAG”), Aircraft Leasing Ireland 
(“ALI”), and industry peers and anticipate that additional categories will be incorporated in 
future disclosures

• AerCap recorded ~16% growth in our global 
Scope 3 Emissions in 2023 compared to 2022
• In 2023, increased utilization across EMEA, the 
Americas, and APAC led to a significant rise in 
Scope 3 emissions. Much of this increase was 
driven by the reopening of China in 2023 post-
COVID-19. IATA reported traffic (in RPKs) 
increased by 126% in the APAC region in 2023 
compared to 2022.  Notably, APAC accounted for 
34% of AerCap’s total leased revenue in 2023
• On December 31, 2023, AerCap had 1,556 aircraft 
compared to 1,572 at the end of 2022, resulting in 
a 1% reduction in our global fleet. The impact of 
the sale of older technology aircraft from the fleet 
resulted in a decrease of ~3 Mt CO2
• During 2023, AerCap purchased 80 new 
technology aircraft, generating a ~25% CO2 
efficiency gain for those aircraft. Combined with 
the impact of aircraft purchases across our entire 
fleet, AerCap generated a ~2.2% reduction in 
gCO2  per Seat/km compared to 2022

Ireland is recognized as a center of excellence in the aviation 
leasing industry and as such, AerCap benefits from having a 
large, attractive pool of experienced talent available to us
AerCap is committed to supporting the next generation of 
industry professionals through a variety of educational 
programs. These programs provide a pipeline of indigenous 
talent that supports the future growth and development of 
our industry
AerCap is a sponsor of the prestigious MSc in Aviation 
Finance program at University College Dublin (“UCD”) 
Michael Smurfit Graduate Business School. In addition to the 
sponsorship, this program involves lectures by some of our 
key employees and internships provided by the Company to 
a number of students from the program, giving graduates 
the opportunity to gain valuable experience across a range 
of disciplines
In August 2021, AerCap launched a 4-year scholarship 
program, providing 10 scholarships to students of the 
Faculty of Engineering at the International School of 
Engineering at Chulalongkorn University, Thailand’s 
number one-ranked university and a world-class leader
in aerospace engineering education. In addition to the 
scholarships, AerCap provides a range of tailored supports 
to students, including guest lectures, workshops and 
summer internships
In 2019, AerCap launched a Women in Aviation scholarship 
program, the first program of its type in Ireland, with the 
University of Limerick. The scholarship program provides 
students of the Aeronautical Engineering degree program 
with a range of supports, including an 8-month internship at 
AerCap. Now in its sixth year, the program aims to create 
awareness among female students pursuing degrees in 
Aeronautical Engineering about the career opportunities 
available to them in the aviation leasing industry. It also aims 
to encourage more female students to consider programs in 
engineering fields
AerCap recently established a partnership with the ISTAT 
Foundation to sponsor students pursuing undergraduate or 
graduate degree programs focused on aviation studies. The 
scholarships will be awarded to students at U.S. universities, 
undertaking studies in aviation-related fields such as 
engineering, aircraft finance and leasing, and aviation law

• AerCap is committed to building a pipeline of 
diverse talent through a variety of initiatives
• In 2023, we launched a DEIB survey inviting 
employees to share their perspectives and 
insights on the matters that are important to 
them, as well as indicating areas of focus for 
the Company. The responses to the survey 
revealed several themes and areas of 
interest, enabling us to further develop our 
DEIB framework
• As part of the program, we conducted focus 
groups across our global offices to gain 
insights into which areas of DEIB are of 
greatest interest to our employees
• We partnered with a global organization that 
helps companies build culture and 
behavioural change programs, to deliver 
diversity and inclusion awareness training for 
all employees 
• We are committed to creating an 
environment where our employees can grow 
and develop while contributing to the 
ongoing success of the Company, regardless 
of race, religion, gender, marital status,

Ireland Sustainability Charter. The Charter 
sets out ten key industry initiatives, including 
a commitment to diversity and equal 
opportunities in the workplace and the wider 
aviation industry

aviation leasing professionals focused on the promotion 
of women in the aviation industry. Members of the AerCap 
team participate in the PropelHer Mentoring program as 
mentors and mentees
Leading Through Inclusion
We are focused on raising awareness among our employees 
and fostering a deeper understanding of the broader 
definition of diversity and inclusion. In 2023, we supported 
AsIAm, Ireland’s National Autism Charity. To mark World 
Autism Awareness Day, we welcomed the CEO of the charity, 
Adam Harris, to speak to AerCap employees. Adam shared
his story to our global audience of his experiences of 
growing up as a young autistic person in Ireland and the 
related challenges
During Pride Month, we took the opportunity to raise 
awareness around sexual orientation and gender diversity. As 
part of the awareness campaign, we welcomed LGBTQ+ and 
HIV activist Rebecca Tallon de Havilland, a trailblazer in the 
LGBTQ+ community. Rebecca spoke about her remarkable 
life experiences as a transgender woman in Ireland, as well 
assharing details of her transition journey
In addition, employees across our global offices took part 
ina Stride for Pride charity walk to raise awareness and 
funds for LGBTQIA+ organizations around the world
including LGBT Ireland, Oogachaga, Singapore, and the 
Stonewall Community Foundation in the U.S

BOARD COMPOSITION 
• AerCap’s directors are from diverse legal, financial, and technical professional 
backgrounds and combine a broad-spectrum of expertise with a reputation for integrity
• The Chairman and CEO positions are held separately and the chairman is a non-executive 
director
• The non-executive directors are carefully selected based on their combined experience 
and expertise, as outlined in the Board profile
• In 2023, the non-executive directors performed a self-assessment of the Board’s 
performance. This included an assessment of how well the Board, its committees and its 
individual members functioned. The non-executive directors concluded that the Board, 
its committees, and its individual members functioned and continue to function 
satisfactorily. Possible improvement opportunities were documented and will be 
monitored through to implementation
• The average tenure for non-executive directors was 8.4 years, as of December 31, 2023. 
Each independent director serves up to 4 years in a single term, whilst some have been 
extended. The Company has benefited from the reappointment of non-executive 
directors given the long-term business cycle of AerCap’s industry (e.g. the initial lease 
for an aircraft term is typically 12 years) and the strategic focus on the long-term creation 
of shareholder value
Directors are appointed at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders by a 
majority vote
Each director serves up to 4 years in a single term 
This strikes the right balance between board stability and the introduction of fresh 
perspectives

OVERVIEW CARE FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT REPORTING APPROACHCORPORATE CITIZENSHIP WORLD-CLASS GOVERNANCE
As reported in our 2024 6-K SEC filings, during January 2024, 
the Company experienced a cybersecurity incident related to 
ransomware. We promptly took steps to contain, assess and 
remediate the incident with the support of third-party 
cybersecurity experts. In addition, we notified law 
enforcement and appropriate regulatory authorities. 
The perpetrator attempted to gain broad access to the 
Company’s information systems and also attempted to 
encrypt the Company’s data through the use of ransomware. 
These attempts failed as a result of the successful operation 
of the Company’s cybersecurity safeguards. 
Upon learning of the attack, we immediately deployed 
business continuity and cybersecurity measures, which we 
believe excluded the perpetrator from our systems by the 
following day the attack and eliminated the identified 
vulnerability. 
Our investigation has determined that the perpetrator did not 
gain access to our key document management systems, our 
treasury or payment systems, or other information systems 
which are key to internal controls over financial reporting. 
However, the perpetrator did exfiltrate certain data of the 
Company, representing less than 0.5% of the Company’s 
overall data by volume.
There was no material disruption to the Company’s 
operations.

OUR ESG STAKEHOLDER MAPPING
• As the world’s largest lessor AerCap has a multitude of relevant stakeholders in the 
context of ESG, including:
Our Financiers – lenders, investors, and rating agencies
Our Customers – primarily airlines
Our Business Partners – suppliers, trade associations and new partners
Our People – employees, communities and NGOs 
Policy Bodies – governments and regulators
• The industry is currently facing a significant supply chain shortfall, while simultaneously 
taking actions to decarbonize. Therefore, it is imperative for AerCap to evaluate the 
most important sustainability challenges that we and the wider global communities in 
which we operate face
• We are currently in a transitional phase as we prepare the groundwork to fulfill future 
disclosure regulatory requirements (EU CSRD and U.S. SEC). As part of our CSRD 
preparatory activities, we are currently identifying all relevant stakeholders and the 
most appropriate way of obtaining their input
• We disclose to, and are rated by, several ESG rating agencies 
• We speak regularly to sustainability experts and seek their views on our approach to 
ESG issues
• We will continue to engage with the sustainability community to help ensure our 
approach remains relevant and in line with best practices in the industry
• We welcome ongoing feedback and dialogue from our stakeholders, and queries should 
be directed to our Head of Government Affairs & Sustainability

Continuous engagement across all relevant stakeholders

ESG RATING AGENCIES
We aim to achieve a continued upward trajectory in our ESG Rating scores to demonstrate continuous improvement  
‘Leader’ Level
Public ESG and sustainability reporting is now more broadly expected by lenders, 
investors, shareholders, and other third parties. Specialist ESG rating agencies provide 
corporate governance and other corporate risk information to investors and shareholders, 
as well as scores and ratings to evaluate companies and investment funds based on ESG or 
sustainability metrics
We disclose to and are rated by several ESG rating agencies (see below sample) and 
recognize that our sustainability performance as rated by these agencies has become an 
increasingly important component of stakeholders’ decision-making
This industry is evolving, and concerns have been raised about the lack of consistency 
between different rating agencies and methodologies. Efforts are underway, especially 
within the EU, to regulate the sector and we support this development. See Page 21 for 
examples of how we are proactively engaging with policy bodies and collaborating with 
the industry
We aim to achieve a continued upward trajectory in our ESG Rating scores to demonstrate 
continuous improvement in our ESG activities and we have been successful in our efforts, as 
evidenced by our recent rating upgrades by MSCI and Morningstar Sustainalytics.

CLIMATE & ESG RELATED REGULATORY DISCLOSURES 
We are preparing our procedures to fulfill future disclosure regulatory requirements
•  AerCap’s first EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive disclosure is due in 
2026 for the year 2025 
• Significant work has already been undertaken within AerCap to facilitate future 
fulfillment of our reporting obligations, including: 
Initial gap assessment
Commencement of “double materiality” assessment
Preparatory procedures are being adapted to support efficient and compliant 
reporting 
• CSRD requires businesses to provide disclosure on their Net-Zero transition plans
• Emerging requirements are focused on providing investors with 
information on a company’s strategy, approach and activity on 
material climate change matters (SEC & EU) and material ESG topics 
more broadly (EU)
• The Output: It will allow for objective and consistent comparisons 
within industries. It will enable stakeholders to more clearly assess 
the trajectory of one business, compared to another 
• Upstream and Downstream: Requires the business to look at its 
financial and climate impacts from an upstream perspective (its 
supply lines) and downstream perspective (its customers) 
• Assurance: Auditors will have to be satisfied with reported 
disclosures (levels of assurance required vary). This is a major 
change
Key Features Of New Disclosures Rules  
• Following a lengthy consultation process, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 
(“SEC”) adopted its new Climate Disclosure rules in March 2024
• AerCap began reviewing the proposed rules when they were first published in 2022 and 
is continuing to prepare on the basis of the final rules. AerCap’s first U.S. SEC disclosure 
under these rules is due in 2026 for the 2025 financial year
These activities are significant undertakings for all companies, but will play a key role in creating consistent reporting, and transparency, with the aspiration of 
driving sustainable investment
AerCap’s ESG Board Committee continues to monitor the Company's preparatory work to help ensure a smooth transition. AerCap is playing a leading role 
across the industry in key areas such as the composition of Scope 3 emissions as it pertains to lessors, as well as the development of EU taxonomy alignment

Accounting for stakeholder issues
The process of identifying stakeholder needs and expectations in relation to sustainability issues is ongoing.  
Identified issues based on a 
traditional assessment approach
• As illustrated throughout this report, we engage 
extensively with all our relevant stakeholders
• We aim to take account of their needs and expectations, 
with regard to ESG changes, and how we can align our 
corporate strategy
• At the same time, we are currently in a transitional phase 
as we prepare the groundwork to fulfill new regulatory 
disclosure requirements (i.e., EU CSRD and U.S. SEC)
• One key requirement of EU CSRD is to carry out a 
“double-materiality” assessment where the company 
must consider the views of stakeholders to obtain their 
views about its impact on people and the environment. 
AerCap has made significant progress in the initial phase 
of this work and we expect the process will be completed 
in 2024. Our future ESG reports will take account of this 
work
Community 
Involvement
In the meantime, we have continued to identify the most 
important issues for AerCap and for our global 
community through our extensive engagement 
processes. See chart containing our assessment based 
on our previous approach.
The inclusion of information in our "double-materiality" 
assessment, our traditional assessment or elsewhere in 
this report is not an indication that we deem such 
information to be "material" for purposes of U.S. 
securities law or important to an understanding of our 
business or an investment decision with respect to our 
securities.

PAGE 47: BOARD EXPERIENCE
As of December 31, 2023.
1. Four of our non-executive directors (out of a total of nine) had served on our Board in excess of 12 years. Each 
independent director serves up to 4 years in a single term, whilst some have been extended. The Company has 
benefited from the reappointment of non-executive directors given the long-term business cycle of AerCap’s 
industry (e.g. the initial lease for an aircraft term is typically 12 years) and the strategic focus on the long-term 
creation of shareholder value
2. The completion of the sale of our outstanding shares by GE resulted in the termination of GE’s right to designate 
directors for election to our Board of Directors. In November 2023, one of GE’s previous designees, Mr. Raby, 
resigned from our Board of Directors. Notwithstanding the termination of GE’s right to designate directors, one of 
GE’s previous designees, Ms. VanBelle, has remained on our Board of Directors. 
3. Public company defined as a company with publicly listed shares.
4. Current or previous CEO/CFO experience in a public company (defined as above).
