STAKEHOLDERS

 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 Letter to Stakeholders

ear stakeholder, 
The 2023 financial year was characterised by the continuing geopolitical crisis triggered by the Russian invasion of 
Ukraine in February 2022 and the military escalation in the Middle East, the exacerbation of the global emergency 
linked to  climate change, and the advent of the new paradigms of Artificial Intelligence, the latest frontier in 
technological innovation, relevant to the media both in terms of opportunity and of risk with respect to the social 
and economic guarantee and protection of information and original content.  
Against this backdrop , the macroeconomic framework witnessed the slow but gradual normalisation of energy 
prices, while still maintaining high "core" inflation, which caused the US and European central banks to maintain 
a restrictive monetary policy and therefore steered a trend in demand which was still rather weak. 
In both geographical areas in which the Group operates, both the gross domestic product and the advertising 
market have improved compared to the initial forecasts and in contrast to other EU countries. In Spain, specifically, 
despite a delay compared to the EU average, GDP figures have essentially recovered to pre-pandemic levels.  
In this context, the MFE Group achieved overall growth in its gross advertising revenues on an annual basis, with 
a significant acceleration in the last quarter of the year in Italy of around 8% compared to the same period of 2022, 
the highest increase in the last seven years. In Spain, despite a still uncertain general context after the elections in 
July and the formation of the new national government in November, revenues essentially held up. In 2023 in its 
reference markets, the Group consolidated its shares in the advertising market thanks to its reinforced television 
leadership among the commercial target audience and recorded highly responsive management in terms of 
containing costs, also o ptimising the energy component, where there had been great pressure in the preceding 
year, above all in the central part of it. 
Despite the general rise in interest rates and increasing  competition, and excluding the contribution of the 
subsidiary ProsiebenSat1, the Group was able to achieve a higher consolidated net profit higher than last year and 
maintained high cash  flow generation, by self-financing investments for development and shareholder 
remuneration.  
On the strength of these results, in 2023 MFE continued to pursue its strategic guidelines with determination, 
focused on maintaining and strengthening its model as a commercial TV broadcaster evolving towards digital in 
both Italy and Spain, and on pan -European development with the goal of achieving adequate dimensions for 
competing in the new environment of global competition . To this end, the merger by incorporation of Mediaset 
España into MFE was completed in the first part of the financial year and MFE's role as the main shareholder 
(29.7% of the voting rights) of the German broadcaster ProsiebenSat1 Media SE was consolidated. 
The results achieved in 2023 once again resulted from the approach of the Group, which, compared to the great 
discontinuity in the business context in recent years, constantly operates by balancing a strong, recognised 
broadcasting identity with a constant capacity to innovate in products, production processes and skills, aware of 
its role in society and as an economic driver in the contexts in which it operates, an approach that aims over time 
to reduce and mitigate the risks connected with the development  of the competitive context and changes in 
D

consumption methods and habits and generate greater economic and social value. 
Leveraging on these principles, in 2023 activities and projects continued to pursue the objectives linked to MFE's 
sustainability strategy, designed to develop and apply  sustainability criteria  organically and functionally as it 
performs its core processes, pursuing the guidelines defined in 2022 by the Board of Directors in the fields of 
Environment, Social and Governance. These guidelines identify the corporate priorities and macro-objectives for 
the coming years:  
 Carbon Neutrality by 2030 
 raising public awareness of environmental and social issues through the activity of a responsible and pluralist 
broadcaster aware of the role played through the dissemination of content 
 the progressive introduction of sustainability criteria and principles into management practices and choices 
throughout the organisation.  
In terms of commitment to the environment , the Group, although aware of the reduced impact in terms of 
direct impact, pursues the goal of carbon neutrality by 2030 in the management of its activities: from the use of 
energy obtained from renewable sources to zero-impact mobility through the "green" redevelopment of the fleet 
of vehicles used by staff, to the progressive introduction of photovoltaic panels capable of meeting a significant 
proportion of the  global electricity needs of offices and studios , and  to the progress  of workspace upgrading  
projects consistent with the new working methods ( in person – remote), making production decisions that not 
only meet ambitious “functional” requirements but also take the ESG impact of both the materials used and the 
new facilities into account. In 2023, the conversion of the car fleet continued, adopting a new car policy that makes 
it mandatory for executives to use new electrified cars (plug -in hybrid or full electric). The implementation of all 
these actions allowed the achievement of the emission reduction targets set for the year.  
With reference to its broadcast offering and consequently its own social impact, MFE is intensifying its role in 
spreading the culture of sustainability in the country to constantly increase public awareness of ESG issues through 
the content distributed on all its platforms. MFE has been at the forefront of the global challenge against 
disinformation and fake news for years, a battle now distinctive of our information content. It is also invo lved in 
the promotion of multi -platform social campaigns on major environmental and social issues, the fight against 
inequalities and discrimination through the activity of "Mediaset ha a cuore il futuro” ( Mediaset cares about the 
future) and in the tangible implementation of social solidarity campaigns and initiatives through Mediafriends. 
Specifically, processes of analysis and mapping of the editorial offer have also been further implemented to 
identify ESG-themed programmes within the television, digital and radio offerings with the progressive support of 
systems using artificial intelligence algorithms to measure the social impact of the content broadcast by our 
networks. Also, in this year's report we then give space to content that within programming in Italy and Spain 
which is related to the sustainable development goals of the UN 2030 Agenda. 
In recent years, some specific protocols have been defined for events and television productions to certify that 
their implementation is in line with best sustainability practices, to raise awareness among both professionals and 
the public about virtuous behaviours towards a reduction of environmental impact. Some leading productions 
such as Le Iene, Striscia la Notizia, Dritto e Rovescio have obtained Green Audiovisual certification.

And again this year, at the heart of the Sustainability Report, we pay great attention to people, the key factor that 
has always been at the heart of our company. MFE is committed to recognising and appreciating the value, 
experience and professionalism of employees and collaborators, as well as valuing the differences and 
characteristics of each individual, creating a situation that ensures the best conditions in terms of health, safe ty, 
welfare and  corporate well-being. All these elements allow the Group to become more attractive to young 
resources and new talent, who can be brought into key areas such as technology, content and advertising.  
With this in mind, training courses, workshops, innovative well-being services and various internal communication 
initiatives on both climate change and social (Diversity and Inclusion) issues were offered to all personnel in 2023, 
through collaboration wi th experts in the sector and/or university institutions with the aim of disseminating, 
stimulating and promoting a sustainable culture still further.  
On the Internal Control System front, the Group is implementing a Green Procurement system, progressively 
extending sampling to collect, analyse and monitor the ESG positioning of its suppliers. 
In keeping with the desire to increasingly raise awareness and encourage senior management to take even more 
new sustainability criteria into account in their day-to-day decisions, the adoption of KPIs linked to achieving key 
ESG targets within managers’ short-term incentive systems was extended in 2023. 
In summary, 2023 too was a year of great commitment involving all parts of the Group, both in the constant pursuit 
of procedures for compliance with rules and regulations and in directing managerial actions towards all 
stakeholders. 
The goal is to ensure and guarantee the sustainable development of MFE in the coming years by integrating, in 
both Italy and Spain, the paths followed thus far, which are destined to take on even greater relevance in the 
coming years characterised by the global challenges of the climate emergency and fight against inequality.

 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 Methodological Note

This document (hereinafter “Sustainability Report” or “Report”) describes the initiatives and the main economic, 
social and environmental outcomes achieved by the MFE Group (hereinafter also “Group”) during 2023 (from 1 
January to 31 December) and is drawn up in compliance with the “Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability 
Reporting Standards” defined by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), in accordance with the “in accordance” 
option. 
The MFE Group Sustainability Report, taking into account the expectations of stakeholders and the impacts 
generated by business activities, offers a description of the management models, the policies implemented by 
the company, the results obtained and the principal real and potential risks and impacts, positive and 
negative, associated with the issues of sustainability (environmental, social, labour relations, respect for human 
rights, the fight against corruption), including the management approaches.  
In the process of formalising its strategic guidelines focusing on the development of its business model, both 
nationally and internationally, the Group constantly monitors the areas of sustainability considered material to its 
development and the commitments and activities carried out and planned with a view to meeting the needs and 
expectations of its own stakeholders and the development of the business context. 
ESG risks are also included, according to their significance as expressed in the Group's Materiality Matrix, in the 
Group's strategic risk assessment model, which is structurally focused on the external and internal risk factors 
directly related to its bus iness model and the guidelines defined by the Board of Directors. ESG risk areas are 
also included, in line with their importance as expressed in the Group's list of material topics. This assessment 
involves identification of material risk/opportunity factors for each of the ESG areas. 
Each risk profile is assessed by taking into account: the general background context (also for benchmarking against 
leading operators in the TMT sector); the monitoring of the Group's main initiatives and projects in these areas; 
and the main feedback from key stakeholders. 
The assessment carried out as part of the annual update process highlighted the overall adequacy of the 
safeguards the Group has employed, given the predominance of active and positive approaches to ESG issues, in 
keeping with its own values, which are a reference as well as being instrumental in pursuing its business objectives. 
In particular, we note the consolidation of and constant attention to structured development initiatives in the 
Human Resources area (training, equal opportunities, welfare, health and safety), the definition of monitoring 
models for the overall broadcast offering, also in relation to greater sensitivity among end users and advertising 
investors to ESG issues, the implementation of projects and initiatives directed towards optimising consumption 
and, in line with the planned goals to reduce direct emissions by 2030, the launch of a process that aims 
to progressively define and introduce models for monitoring the ESG positioning of its s upply chain (Green 
Procurement). 
In particular regard to respect for human rights , and given the regulatory environment in which the Group 
operates, this topic is addressed as part of the management of relations with employees and suppliers, in 
observance of the principles and values embodied in the Code of Ethics of the Group.  
In view of the specific nature of the business sector in which the Group operates, note that the Group does not 
consume significant amounts of water or emit atmospheric pollutants other than greenhouse gases.

1.2  HISTORY 
Before 1996. The origins of the Mediaset 
Group lie in the late 1970s, when Milan -based 
entrepreneur Silvio Berlusconi founded a local 
cable TV channel, Telemilano, broadcasting 
from its purpose-built headquarters.  
 Two years later, in 1980, Telemilano was 
rebaptised as Canale 5. Due to a change in the 
regulations, it began transmitting all over Italy, 
something hitherto prohibited under Italian 
law. 
 The new channel was a breath of fresh air for 
the Italian viewing public, because until then 
the only national broadcaster was the state -
controlled Rai, whose three channels 
constituted a monopoly. 
 To compete on equal terms with the public 
service broadcaster, the new private 
broadcaster put together its own 3 -network 
offering: Canale 5 was joined by Italia 1  
(acquired from Rusconi in 1982) and 
Retequattro (acquired from Arnoldo 
Mondadori Editore in 1984). 
 The new broadcaster was named Rti (Reti 
televisive italiane)  and was assisted by an 
exclusive advertising sales agency, Publitalia 
'80, and two other companies: Videotime, 
which was in charge of technology and TV 
production, and Elettronica Industriale , 
which managed the transmission network 
infrastructure. 
 Together, Rti, Publitalia, Videotime and 
Elettronica Industriale were placed under the 
control of a new company, Mediaset. And so 
the Mediaset Group was born. 
1996 Mediaset is floated on the Milan stock 
exchange, opening its stock to institutional 
investors and small shareholders (around 
300,000). 
1997 Mediaset's international expansion 
begins with its acquisition of a 25% stake in 
private Spanish broadcaster Telecinco. 
1999 The Group enters the online world with 
Mediaset.it (a website dedicated to Canale 5, 
Italia 1 and Retequattro) and Mediaset Online 
(renamed TgCom in 2001), a news site available 
over multiple platforms (internet, television, 
radio, Mediavideo teletext and mobile phone). 
2003 Mediaset increases its stake in Telecinco, 
gaining a controlling interest in the company 
with 50.1% of its shares. Telecinco is floated on 
the Madrid stock exchange the following year. 
2004 Digital terrestrial television launches in 
Italy. The new technology allows many more 
channels to be broadcast compared to the 
existing analogue system. Mediaset launches 
Boing, a channel directed exclusively at 
children, and Mediashopping, a secure 
teleshopping channel. 
2005 The Group launches Mediaset 
Premium, a digital terrestrial channel offering 
live coverage of Serie A football via smartcards, 
with no need for subscription. Mediaset 
Premium also offers TV movie premieres, 
theatre and live events in the pay -per-view 
format. 
2006 Pan’s Labyrinth , a film produced by 
Gruppo Telecinco, wins 3 Oscars. 
2007 In a consortium with Cyrte Fund and 
Goldman Sachs, Mediaset relieves Telefonica of 
control of Endemol, a Dutch TV production

company and the world's leading format 
producer. 
 Mediaset also acquires Medusa, Italy's leading 
cinema production and distribution company.  
 Mediaset launches a new free -to-air digital 
terrestrial channel: Iris. The new channel 
specialises in classic movies, music, and 
adaptations from literature and theatre. 
2008 Mediaset signs an agreement for the 
acquisition of Taodue, a leading Italian 
producer of quality fiction and drama series. 
 Mediaset launches Premium Gallery , a new 
premium content service available over digital 
terrestrial TV, using the smartcard format. 
Gallery has exclusive broadcasting rights in Italy 
for the best US films and series by Time Warner 
and NBC-Universal.  
 Disney Channel  and Premium Calcio  24 
launch. 
2009 Publitalia '80 and Mondadori Pubblicità 
reach an agreement on online advertising sales 
and found a new company owned in equal 
proportions, Mediamond. 
 TivùSat, Italy's first free digital satellite 
platform, launches. Its owner, Tivù s.r.l., is 
jointly owned by Rai (48.25%), Mediaset 
(48.25%) and Telecom Italia Media (3.5%). 
TivùSat operates as a complement to digital 
terrestrial TV, serving areas the terrestrial signal 
is unable to reach. 
 In Spain, Mediaset S.p.A., Gestevision Telecinco 
S.A. and Promotora de Informaciones S.A. 
(Prisa Group) announce the acquisition by 
Telecinco of a newly formed company, which 
includes the business unit of Cuatro 
(Sogecable S.A's free -to-air Spanish television 
network,) and the 22% stake in Digital Plus. 
The deal makes the Mediaset Group the leading 
TV operator in Spain. 
 Taodue produces Checco Zalone's Cado dalle 
nubi (distributor: Medusa Film), the 2009/2010 
season's biggest box office hit. 
2010 video.mediaset.it, a catch -up service 
allowing viewers to watch recently broadcast 
Mediaset TV programmes, goes live.  
 NewsMediaset, an "in house" agency 
providing images, news and services to the 
entire Mediaset structure, is created. 
 12 May: Mediaset launches La5, a free -to-air 
digital terrestrial channel broadcasting female-
oriented content 24 hours a day. 
 26 November: Mediaset Extra , a new free 
channel specialising in reruns of the most 
popular Mediaset entertainment programmes,

detective films and thrillers, and Premium 
Cinema Comedy, a showcase for the best of 
Italian and US comedy. 
  Mediaset Italia 2 , a new free -to-air digital 
terrestrial channel, begins transmission. The 
new channel offers movies, TV films, 
documentaries, cartoons, sports and 
entertainment shows directed at a young, 
predominantly male, audience. 
  Cartoonito, a free -to-air digital terrestrial 
channel for children aged 6 and under, 
launches. Like Boing, Cartoonito is the fruit of a

joint venture by Mediaset and Turner 
Broadcasting System Europe Limited, and 
enriches Mediaset's free content offering for 
children and teenagers. 
 Plans to merge EI Towers  with DMT are 
approved. 
  In 2012, on completion of the financial 
restructuring of the Endemol Group, the 
Mediaset Group reduces and then sells its 
holding in Endemol. 
  Premium Play, conceived as the successor to 
Premium Net Tv, is launched. With its advanced 
technology, ease of use, quality and innovative 
content, Premium Play breaks new ground in 
the Italian multimedia sector. 
  TgCom24 is repurposed as a free -to-air news 
channel available over DTT (slot 51) and 
satellite (slot 24), continuing to operate online 
via TgCom24.it and now available for 
smartphone and tablet with free -to-download 
apps. 
  Taodue repeats the success of Cado dalle nubi  
with a new film production, Che bella giornata 
(distributor: Medusa Film), which outstrips the 
former in terms of viewer figures and box office 
receipts. 
2013 Paolo Sorrentino's film The Great Beauty 
(producer: Medusa Film) wins the Oscar for 
best foreign picture and the Golden Globe for 
best film. A new Checco Zalone film produced 
by Taodue, Sole a catinelle, is the year's biggest 
box office hit with receipts of 51.8 million euros, 
and the most -viewed Italian film since Cinetel 
records began. 
  Mediaset España secures "free" broadcasting 
rights for 25 matches - including those featuring

1.3  THE VALUES OF THE MFE GROUP 
The founding principles of the MFE Group are embodied in its Code of Ethics, which defines the values cherished 
by the group at every level and in every area it pursues its business interests.  
The first draft was approved by Mediaset S.p.A. and its subsidiaries in 2002. Subsequent amendments and 
additions were made in 2008 and 2012. 
The present version of the Code of Ethics was approved by the Board of Directors of Mediaset S.p.A. and by other 
Italian companies belonging to the Group in 2019.  In September 2021 MFE -Mediaforeurope N.V., the holding 
company under Dutch law, also adopted its own Code of Ethics. The companies under Spanish law belonging to 
the MFE Group have implemented their own Còdigo Etico, based on the parent Company’s, the latest version of 
which was approved on 24 July 2019. 
The Code of Ethics was adopted in the conviction that ethical management is a fundamental element, necessary 
for the success of every business venture. With reference to companies under Italian law, it also represents a 
cornerstone of Compliance Programmes pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/01 and of compliance programmes in 
general, as well as the Group’s internal control system, which also includes all the Organisational Guidelines (LGO) 
issued for each individual business process.  
Modifications and additions to the Code of Ethics are subject to the approval of the Boards of Directors of the 
individual member companies and promptly communicated to the relevant parties. The MFE Code of Ethics also 
provides that each Group company can adapt its own Code of Ethics  –where necessary  – in light of its own 
characteristics as well as according to the law that applies in the relevant country. 
In the pursuit of its business activities, the Group therefore undertakes to respect the applicable laws and 
regulations in all countries where it operates, in conformity with the principles of loyalty, propriety, responsibility, 
freedom, individual dignity and respect for diversity in all its forms, rejecting all forms of discrimination based on 
sex, race, language, religion, political convictions or personal or social conditions. 
As a major presence in the social and economic context in Italy and in other countries, the MFE Group predicates 
its growth on a solid reputation for transparency and rigour in the pursuit of its business activities. 
In this respect the Group recognises the central role of human resources  and is committed to promoting a 
working environment based on respect for people and the values of loyalty, trust, transparency and integration, 
stressing priorities such as developing skills and professional capacities, equal opportunities, protecting the  
mental and physical well-being of workers (also in terms of health and safety), confidentiality and protection of 
personal data. 
In regard to the various categories of stakeholders, the MFE Group has always made every effort to combat 
corruption by acting transparently in its dealings with clients, suppliers and institutions, always and without 
exception respecting the principle of free competition. 

Page 24:
 
 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 1 ▪ The MFE Group

The Group has always valued the wealth to be found in diversity , research and innovation, caring for the 
young and for the environment, enabling each individual to find fulfilment in his work, the basic principles 
which underpin its activities, and the people who have made it successful. 
 
1.4 MEDIASET FOR THE COMING GENERATION 
In 2023, MFE consolidates its leadership among the youth audience, proving itself as an indispensable point of 
reference for those who want to reach this valuable target group quickly and en masse.  
MFE’s Italian leadership in the 15 -34 target age range is increasingly solid in all time slots year after year, 
with an ever-widening gap compared to its competitor RAI: prime time is at 43.2%, up 0.2 points compared to the 
previous year and almost 12 points more than the state TV broadcaster (it was 10 in 20 22); daytime at 44% vs 
43.4% (+0.6 compared to 2022) no fewer than 16.5 points above RAI (it was 15 in 2022); day as a whole at 43.8% 
vs 43.4%, almost 16 points above RAI (it was 14 in the previous year). 
The result, as always, emerges from a unified strategy with a contribution from all of the Group’s networks, both 
the historic ones (31.6% among ages 15 –34 in prime time) and thematic and profile (11.6% for the same target 
and slot).  
With respect to the individual networks: Canale 5  confirms its leadership in Italy among young people aged 
between 15 and 34 in all slots: prime time (20.8% share), day as a whole (20.6%) and daytime (21.0%).  
The following of the female youth audience remains very relevant: in prime time, Amici di Maria de Filippi achieves 
a share of almost 50% among very young women between 15 and 19 (49.6%); there are also very strong numbers 
for the 20–24 (45.9%) and 25–34 (48.3%) targets. There are similar results for C’è Posta per te, another unmissable 
event for the female audience with peaks among the target of the very young: 35.8% of those aged 15–19, 37.4% 
for 20–24 and 47.5% for 25–34.  
The figures were also excellent for Big Brother (32.5% among women aged 20–24 and 35.5% for 25–34) and there 
was success yet again for the media phenomenon of Tú sí que vales with 37.5% share among women aged 25–34; 
the new show Amore + Iva by Checco Zalone performed well, at 30.3% among women aged 25–34. 
Other very popular programmes include Felicissima Sera (36.4% among women aged 25–34) and L'Isola dei Famosi 
(29.6% for the same target).  
As always, let’s consider self-produced fiction, an important genre for MFE’s female audience. The offering saw a 
mix of new titles such as Il Patriarca (22.4% among women aged 20 –24 and 25.4% for women aged 25 –34) and 
established products like Fosca Innocenti with Vanessa Incontrada (22.7% among women aged 25–34), the second 
season of Buongiorno mamma! (27.3% among women aged 20–24, 32.0% for women aged 25–34) and Luce dei tuoi 
occhi with Anna Valle (23.2% among women aged 25–34). Finally, the great success of the soap Terra Amara (20.9% 
among young women aged 15–19) should be noted.  
For the female target audience, the daytime segment remains unmissable, with the fixtures of Verissimo (28.6% 

Page 25:
 
1 ▪ The MFE Group SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 
 
21 
among women aged 15–19, 26.4% 20-24 and 26.6% 25–34) and Uomini e Donne (41.1% among women aged 15–
19, 37.7% 20–24 and 38% 25–34).  
With respect to men, the UEFA Champions League was as strong as ever, especially in the spring stage leading up to 
the final. It’s the most watched event among the very young with 45.2% share among ages 15 –19, 41% for ages 
20–24 and 35.1% for ages 25–34. The most important matches reached considerable peak audiences, as always, 
starting with the Inter-Manchester City final featuring an Italian team (record figure of 71.8% among men aged 15–
19, 58.1% for 25–34); then there was the Inter-Milan semi-final at almost 60% among men aged 15–19 and 52.1% 
for 25–34. In sport, 2023 also confirmed the great appeal of the Coppa Italia among the male youth audience, 
exclusively free-to-air on Mediaset networks. The decision was rewarded with a 37.5% share among men aged 
15–19 and 35.6% for 20–24. Among the most popular matches were the Inter-Fiorentina final (56.6% among men 
aged 15–19, 56% for 20–24) and Inter-Juventus semi-final with peaks of 53.5% among men aged 15–19, 50.9% for 
20–24 and 45.9% for 25–34.  
In terms of productions, Ciao Darwin stands out at 47.4% among men aged 15 –19 and 41.2% for 25 –34. Other 
important results were achieved by Tú sí que vales (39.3% among men aged 15 –19 and 35.4% for 25 –34), L'Isola 
dei Famosi (29.9% for 25–34), Lo Show dei Record (24.5% for the same target), Striscia la Notizia (25.2% among men 
aged 15–19) and Paperissima Sprint (20.1% for 15–19 and 19.8% for 20–24). 
Finally, Melaverde has an increasingly central role in the area of sustainability. The programme dedicated to Italy’s 
diverse food and wine traditions increasingly focuses on ESG issues: the 19 November episode dedicated to 
sustainable fishing in the Po Delta is one example worth mentioning. The programme reaches 26.4% among men 
aged 20–24.  
Italia 1 (8.2% share among those aged 15–34 in prime time and 8.1% for daytime) remains MFE’s main point of 
reference for the youth audience. Le Iene (19.3% among men aged 25–34 in spring) and Le Iene inside (12.6% for 
the same target) confirmed their strength. The figure for the Coppa Italia was excellent, with primetime matches at 
11.9% for men aged 15–19 and 14.2% for 20–24.  
In daytime, Studio Aperto plays an important role in communicating the news of the day to young people: the 
lunchtime edition achieves 19.8% among men aged 15–19 and 16.4% among 20–24-year-olds. For this network, 
a programme with a great commitment to sustainability deserves menti on: E-Planet (5.7% among men aged 25–
34) with a focus on green lifestyle and a look at the latest developments in electric mobility. 
Lastly, The Simpsons has for many years (since 1 October 1991, originally on Canale 5) represented a bulwark, at 
12.4% among men aged 20-24 and 16.6% for 25–34. 
As always, we would note that a specific area of the company monitors all programming to check the impact of 
programmes on minors. 
Another dedicated organisational structure deals with the digital offering precisely in order to guarantee access 
to content for the coming generation. TV and radio programmes are enhanced through digital extension initiatives 
on all major connected digital platforms (desktops, mobile and wearable devices, tablets, smart TV, etc.). 
These are the main results: 

Page 26:
 
 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 1 ▪ The MFE Group 
 
22 
 Total MFE Properties Video content consumption amounted to around 4.2 billion over the year, representing 
10% growth on the previous year, with 644 million hours of video  generated in total, representing 35% 
growth compared to 2022 (Source Webtrekk).  
 During the year, the Information hub audience saw significant growth, reaching an average Total Audience of 
2,5 million unique daily users in 2023 (Source Audiweb 2.0, overall perimeter with TAL), positioning itself 
under the TGCOM24 brand in third place in the Italian digital information market. 
 Together, the information hub’s free apps saw around 15,3 million downloads  by the end of 2023, 
representing 4% growth compared to the base at the end of 2022. In this context, the TGCOM24 app achieved 
a total of 4 million downloads, with the base of installations increasing by 6% compared to 2022; in 2023 
alone, there were 157,000 downloads. The weather forecasting service (Meteo.it) achieved 7,1 million  
downloads, with a growth of 4%. Downloads of the SportMediaset app reached 2,7 million (+4% compared 
to 2022); in 2023 alone, there were 107,000 downloads. The TG5 app achieved 1.5 million downloads in 
2023, growth of 5%. (Source: App Annie at 31 December 2023; the base of app installations considered refers 
only to the active versions distributed in the stores). MFE Radio’s set of free apps deserve special mention. 
Together, they saw around 2,1 million downloads by the end of 2023, representing 12% growth compared to 
the base at the end of 2022. 
In relation to Social Media Network presence, the Group confirmed itself as one of the leading European media 
companies in creating engagement with its communities: a total of 43.5 million followers  on MFE network 
Facebook pages, over 10 million followers on X accounts, 23 million followers on Instagram accounts and 
more than 1 million on TikTok Mediaset Infinity profile. 
In Spain too, the Group maintained its leadership among the youth audience (aged 13–24 and 25–44), reaching 
a share of 28.6% in 2023 through a broadcast offering targeted at the coming generation; examples include La Isla 
de las tentaciones (28,2% share in the commercial target audience).  
With Mediaset Games, the MFE Group in Spain continued its activity in the video game industry and of its original 
products under film and television licences in the digital entertainment industry in general. 
In the area of managing human resources, categorised as stakeholders (see Chapter 5 “People”), the MFE Group 
has launched managerial development projects through classroom sessions and individual training meetings for 
young graduates.  
The commitment and motivation of employees are considered essential to the Group's success. Young people are 
also constantly offered opportunities for professional growth, capitalising on the diversity of origin, experience 
and competence of the new resources. 
Finally, it should be noted that, again with a view to taking the new dynamics and lifestyles connected with 
technological development into account, the use of smart working, which had already been tested successfully 
during the last years, was extended further in 2023. 
It should also be noted that the MFE Group is highly attentive in both Italy and Spain to internship opportunities 
that supplement and complete courses of study in collaboration with major universities. During internships, young 

Page 27:

23 
undergraduates can approach the world of work, experiencing professional relationships and using the 
knowledge acquired during their studies. 
On the subject of higher education initiatives (see Chapter 6 Community and Territory) for people not employed 
by the company, the Group’s commitment to promoting Master’s and training courses aimed at young graduates 
in collaboration with major universities should be stressed. These initiatives are directed towards a professional 
future in the world of television, marketing, e-trade marketing, sales and digital communication. 
In Italy, we organise the Master’s in Journalism: this is the training course for professional journalists, combining 
the communications and information expertise of IULM University and the MFE Group. It is a professional training 
course, which means it is recognised by the National Association of Journ alists as the equivalent of an 
apprenticeship.  
The Master’s in Marketing, Digital Communication and Sales Management , established in 1988 by 
Publitalia’80 is also highly appreciated. The Master's is a 13-month (lectures and internship) postgraduate course 
with limited admission aimed at graduates looking to a professional future in the field of marketing, trade 
marketing, sales and digital communication.  
Below are the most relevant training activities in Spain during 2023: 
 Master's in audiovisual content creation and management, launched in 2009 in collaboration with the 
European University of Madrid;  
 "Sumas Talento" scholarships awarded for the Diploma in Drama and Audiovisual Creation at the Madrid 
Audiovisual Drama School (MADS). 
The social communication campaigns that have always distinguished the MFE Group also continue. Awareness -
raising campaigns with TV and radio commercials and digital and social media coverage aimed at the community 
and youth issues in particular (see Chapter 6 Community and territory).  
The “Mediaset ha a cuore il futuro”  (Mediaset cares about the future) initiative is a concrete way of putting 
the MFE Group’s skills and communicative power at the service of society.  
Social communication campaigns that operate according to an integrated multimedia scheme featuring TV and 
radio advertising as well as digital and social media coverage address issues of national importance. These may 
relate to national emergencies or problems that are sometimes neglected. This lends continuity and power to the 
commitment that the company already expresses through its programmes.  
With respect to the “Mediaset ha a cuore il futuro” Campaigns, we would mention International Women’s Day and 
World Earth Day, as well as campaigns on the Oceans or rediscovering Italy’s tourist heritage. 
In 2023, radio proceeded with the commitments undertaken in previous years towards the community. 
In addition to the campaigns already mentioned on all Mediaset networks, the Group’s Radio Stations have 
supported non-profit organisations such as “La casa della Speranza”, which helps people in need, or “Airalzh”, 
which is committed to raising awareness to combat the devastating effects of Alzheimer’s by promoting prevention 
and research. The AIL National Anti-Blood Disease Day was also promoted in June, 2023.

Mediaset social campaigns are also a tradition in Spain: through the “12 meses” initiative in 2023, initiatives were 
pursued related to childhood well-being and the concepts of environmental protection, inclusiveness and the fight 
against gender-based violence. 
Finally, the activity of Mediafriends Onlus (see Chapter 6 Community and Territory - Social utility initiatives), a non -
profit organisation, is a concrete expression of how the MFE Group understands Corporate Social Responsibility. 
Over the years, Mediafriends has supported numerous TV and other events to raise funds for the projects of non-
profit associations. The most notable of these is Fabbrica del sorriso (the smile factory). At 31 December 2023, 
over 80 million euros have been raised and distributed, allowing 185 associations to implement 312 charity 
projects in Italy and around the world. 
With regard to promoting youth entrepreneurship  and supporting the world of work and promoting the 
territory in general, we would highlight the activities carried out by AD4Ventures (see Chapter 6 Community and 
Territory-aimed at the community). 
This venture capital project involves investing in shares in start-ups, mainly digital in the consumer and retail area 
with high growth and development potential, through advertising campaigns in Italy and Spain. 
The business model of AD4Ventures contributes to the growth of the companies in which investments are made, 
providing a great boost for all those young entrepreneurs still unable to access the big world of television media.

1.5  THE MFE GROUP, ITS BUSINESS CONTEXT, AND 
SUSTAINABILITY 
In the pursuit of its media company business activities, the Group maintains relations both in Italy and in Spain 
with a multiplicity of stakeholders in its efforts to protect their interests, while setting itself the target of 
generating a positive social impact in the territories where it operates.  
The Group pays the utmost attention to complying with the applicable laws and regulations  in all the 
countries in which it operates and undertakes to act in accordance with the principles of loyalty, propriety, 
responsibility and freedom of the individual, respecting diversity and rejecting discrimination in all its forms.  
The Group is also monitoring the development of regulation forming the basis for future non -financial reporting 
disclosure obligations, with particular reference to compliance with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting 
Directive (CSRD) UE 2022/2464 adopted by the European Parliament on 10 November 2022 and published in 
the Official Gazette on 16 December 2022 , which will replace the regulatory provision of the NFRD (2014/95/EU  
Directive) governing the current section of this report relating to non -financial information. The goal of the CSRD 
is to further increase transparency in environmental, social and governance reporting in order to further promote 
investments to support the economic transition in line with the European Green Deal. The CSRD Directive will be 
applicable to MFE starting from MFE’s Consolidated Annual Report for 2024 ( to be published in 2025 ) and will 
require a limited certiﬁcation report as of that date. In general, the CSRD provides for a revised reporting model 
and an expansion of the di sclosure and reporting obligations to be prepared in accordance with the European 
Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS)  prepared by the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group 
(EFRAG) and adopted by the European Commission by means of the Delegated Act of 31 July 2023. The adoption 
of these standards will also entail the introduction of the principle of double material ity to the process directed 
towards performance of the materiality analysis, taking into consideration both the impact of company act ivities 
on the environment and the financial impact of ESG issues on the company. In this regard, the Group set out an 
action plan to ensure compliance with the new regulations during 2023. In particular, a gap analysis was 
conducted to identify the detail ed information that the Group will have to complete with reference to the 2024 
financial year in order to meet the new ESRS standards correctly. Starting from the current framework for drafting 
sustainability information linked to the GRI standards and the related performance indicators currently produced, 
the Group has classified the information gaps identified on the basis of the criticality of the processes that will lead 
to the creation and management of new metrics, starting in concert with the busines s areas concerned specific 
sites for the most critical processes related in particular to the calculation of scope 3, the extension of the 
information to the entire value chain and double materiality . For the latter, the Group initiated an initial dual 
materiality exercise, taking into consideration the “Draft EFRAG IG 2 - Materiality Assessment” and “Draft EFRAG IG 2 - 
Value Chain” guidelines, and applying the metrics and methodologies already in use in its ERM model. The analysis 
thus conducted did not provide evidence of new issues compared to those already reported. During the 2024 
stakeholder engagement activities, however, further in-depth analysis of financial materiality issues is planned to 
support the results obtained so far. Finally, the results of these analyses and the rela ted action plans were 
presented to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors of MFE. 
Among the main indicators to be reported starting from the Sustainability Report 2024 is the Scope 3  
measurement, required by  ESRS E1 , concerning greenhouse gas emissions generated by the company’s 

Page 30:
 
 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 1 ▪ The MFE Group 
 
26 
activities along the value chain, both upstream from its suppliers and downstream through the distribution of its 
services to end customers. The Group, also with the support of external specialised providers, is preparing the 
necessary identification of the activities to be included in the scope of reporting and defining the relevant 
measurement and estimation models , in order to pursue our commitment to a more sustainable and resilient 
future.  
The Group also takes ESG factors into account as an element and reference criterion for its decision-making and 
investment assessment processes relating to the operational areas directed towards launching targeted initiatives 
and projects with a view to greater environmental efficiency (reduction in consumption, diversification of energy 
sources) and the definition of its own self -produced content and its communication campaigns in line with its 
broadcasting and social responsibility profile.  
Given MFE’s sector, the human factor is of central strategic importance, resulting in a constant and growing 
commitment to looking after, training and developing its employees and seeking out new talents to encourage 
processes of innovation and growth in skills, as well as particular attention to protecting intellectual property and 
minors and developing initiatives directed towards the formation and promotion of culture and in general the 
social responsibility that comes with a role as leading national television broadcaster.  
At present, the impact generated and experienced by the Group in the area of Climate Change does not represent 
a materially critical aspect for the Group, either directly or indirectly in both relative and absolute terms. The Group 
has in any case always been committed to ongoing and precise compliance with and monitoring of the 
development of r egulation in this area, in particular the guidelines from the European Commission 
(Communication 2019/C 209/01 “Guidelines on non-financial reporting: Supplement on reporting climate-related 
information”) and the recent adoption by the European Commission of the Media and Audiovisual Action Plan 
(MAAP), which aims to support the recovery and transformation of these industries, which have been particularly 
affected by the pandemic crisis and are essential for democracy, cultural diversity and European digital autonomy. 
This action plan focuses on three main areas of activity (recovery, transformation, more tools and capacity) 
including the creation of a climate-neutral audiovisual industry. The European commercial television association 
(ACT), of which the Group is a founding member, is preparing a position paper to the EU institutions in connection 
with this plan. 
In order to manage all of these factors in an increasingly proactive, planned and shared manner, MFE has 
voluntarily provided for an ESG Committee within its governance model, made up of independent directors with 
the aim of dialogue, stimulating management and monitoring the Group’s activities in these areas.  
On 29 March 2022 , the MFE Board of Directors, following a process of mapping and analysis of the Group’s 
activities and positioning in the various ESG spheres shared with the Sustainability Committee, identified the 
following guidelines and macro -objectives to be pursued in Italy for the various ESG spheres, launching 
appropriate initiatives and projects: 
 In the Environmental area, the Group, which given its characteristic activities does not in any case have 
a significant impact in terms of direct emissions, has always been inspired by the principles of 
responsibility for protecting the planet, through sustainable natural res ource management, aims to 
progressively reduce CO2 emissions until Carbon Neutrality is achieved by 2030. To this end, the 
Group is considering the adoption of reduction targets that are transparent and scientifically robust in 

Page 31:
 
1 ▪ The MFE Group SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 
 
27 
order to contribute to the goals set by the Paris Agreement on Climate Change (COP 21, limit global 
warming to 1.5°C). 
 In the Social area, the Group has always recognised the central importance of people and sought to 
promote their experience, professionalism and diversity, already achieving excellent standards of gender 
equality both in terms of number and pay gap (with potential areas for improvement at management level) 
and excellent levels in welfare policy management. On this basis, the goals indicated are therefore: 
  • Maintain the current levels of distribution and pay equity for each category,  through 
recruitment and professional development policies that encourage the growth of the less represented gender 
into managerial roles. 
  • Maintain the standards of excellence achieved by the Group in the field of welfare and 
training, both in terms of the level of investment and the variety and innovation of the service offer. 
 Furthermore, with reference to its broadcast offering, MFE intends to continue playing a central role in the 
dissemination of the culture of sustainability in the country with the aim of increasing public awareness 
around ESG issues through content distributed on all available platforms in keeping with its value 
system and responsibility as a pluralist broadcaster.  
 In the Governance field, the decision was taken to adopt a system to guide and control ESG initiatives and 
mechanisms to guide managerial action with the aim of progressively adopting sustainability criteria 
and principles in managerial practices and choices throughout the organisation, through specific 
training initiatives and the introduction of ESG objectives among the parameters of incentive systems. 
In line with the ESG goals defined by the Board of Directors, the following main initiatives were implemented in 
Italy in 2023: 
In the area of the Environment, as of 2022, the Group purchases electricity to power its offices, production 
centres and its own radio network which is exclusively green, or with guarantees of origin from 100% renewable 
sources. This green energy also makes it possible to power the ele ctrified cars in the company fleet, making the 
mobility of company cars completely sustainable (zero -emissions supply chain) when travelling.  To this end, 
charging infrastructure for electric cars in the company fleet was established at the Cologno Monzese management 
centre. Gradual conversion of this fleet to electrified models (full-electric or plug-in) has begun. The electrification 
of the commercial fleet will follow the development of the offering in terms of available models and range (in view 
of the mobility needs of this type of user). Finally, projects have been launched at the management centre in 
Cologno Monzese to revise workspaces according to environmentally sustainable design choices. 
In the Social area, training courses, innovative well-being services and various internal communication initiatives 
were put forward with the goal of disseminating and promoting a sustainable culture further and a pre-assessment 
process was launched to assess the company’s position with respect to gender equality issues, in order to identify 
the main opportunities for improvement and assess whether to undertake a potential certification process under 
the new legislation. 
With reference to its broadcast offering, in addition to the continuous drive in the “ Mediaset ha a cuore il 
futuro” (Mediaset cares about the future) campaigns that aim to promote and raise public awareness around 

Page 32:
 
 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 1 ▪ The MFE Group 
 
28 
social and sustainability-related issues, the Group has designed and structured mapping processes to identify ESG-
themed programmes in the TV, Digital and Radio offering, and establish indicators related to product and use 
volumes and adopting a process of tracking and managing metadata related to television content.  
In the Governance area, ESG goals have been introduced among the parameters of the Managers’ short -term 
incentive systems. For a more detailed analysis, please refer to the Compensation Report included in the 2023 
Consolidated Financial Statements. 
MAPPING OF STAKEHOLDERS AND MATERIALITY ANALYSIS 
In keeping with the reporting principles drawn up by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the first Sustainability 
Report was drawn up, involving the principal company departments, using a structured analysis designed to 
identify the key stakeholders for the organisation and the most material topics for the preparation of the Report. 
For the purposes of sustainability reporting, topics deemed material, or significant, are those of an economic, 
social and environmental nature on which a business produces a potential or real positive or negative impact and 
which may substantially affect the assessments and decisions of stakeholders. The materiality analysis  
therefore takes into consideration not only the perspective of the organisation but also that of the stakeholders 
themselves. These analyses are periodically reviewed and updated. 
 
 
 
For the purposes of preparing this NFD, on 14 February 2024 the Board of Directors confirmed the materiality of 
the topics in the Materiality List, presented in 2023, after consulting the Audit Committee which met on 8 February 
2024. 


Page 33:
 
1 ▪ The MFE Group SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 
 
29 
In relation to the CSRD Directive and ESRS reporting standards coming into force, the Group will progressively 
incorporate the assessment models inspired by the principle of double materiality into the performance of 
Materiality analysis starting from the annual reporting for the year 2024. 
To make up the Materiality List, the significance of these issues assigned by the various categories of stakeholder 
resulted from the stakeholder engagement activities carried out in 2022. 
Specifically, to create the materiality list, the company management identified and subsequently involved the 
following stakeholder cluster: 
 Investors, shareholders and the financial community 
 Users and customers 
 Employees; 
 Suppliers and subcontractors 
 School, Universities and research centres 
 Collaborating artists, business partners, content suppliers 
The topics shown in the following table are already sorted by relevance in terms of current and potential impact, 
positive and negative, assigned in the course of the activities described above.  Only impact materiality issues 
required by the GRI standards currently used to prepare non -financial reporting are included in this list. As 
previously indicated, from 2024, due to the entry into force of the CSRD, the following list will be supplemented 
by considering the impact materiality and financial materiality issues required by the ESRS standards.

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS) 
In this document, it was deemed 
appropriate to link the SDGs that could 
be related directly to the main topics 
presented, from the 17 Sustainable 
Development Goals  defined by the 
United Nations in 2015 and contained in 
the Sustainable Development Agenda. 
 
 
These objectives contain the Guidelines that commit governments and international economic actors to achieving 
specific environmental, social and economic targets by 2030.  
These links were established by analytically comparing the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with the 
material topics and the Group's characteristic activities and services. The following 11 sustainable development 
objectives were identified on the basis of this analysis.  
The impact of the individual material topics on the Sustainable Development Goals is summarised in the 
following diagram:

3.1  CORPORATE  
GOVERNANCE 
 
MFE-MEDIAFOREUROPE N.V. (“MFE” or “Company”)  is a public company under Dutch law ( Naamloze 
Vennootschap) with a secondary office in Italy in Cologno Monzese (Milan), Viale Europa 46 and a secondary 
office in Spain in Madrid, Carretera de Fuencarral a Alcobendas, 4. 
The Company has tax residence in Italy and since 1996 has been listed on the Electronic Stock Market (since 25 
October 2021 called Euronext Milan) managed by Borsa Italiana S.p.A. As of 14 June 2023, MFE ordinary “A” shares 
have also been listed on the Spanish stock exchanges in Barce lona, Bilbao, Madrid and Valencia, organised and 
managed by the respective market management companies (Sociedades Rectoras de las Bolsas de Valores). 
Following the transfer of its registered office to Amsterdam in the Netherlands (the “Transfer”), completed on 18 
September 2021, the Company chose the Netherlands as its home Member State, for the purposes of article 18, 
paragraph 2021 of the Transparency  Directive (Directive 2/EC), notifying the market pursuant to 2004:25a, 
paragraph 1 of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht).  
As a company based in the Netherlands, MFE is subject to the Dutch Corporate Governance Code (“DCGC”). 
On 20 December, 2022, the Corporate Governance Code Monitoring Committee published the update to the 8 
December, 2016 version of the DCGC effective from 1 January, 2017 and available at the following web address – 
https://www.mccg.nl/publicaties/codes/2016/12/8/corporate-governance-code-2016 in an unofficial English 
translation. The new code (available at https://www.mccg.nl/publicaties/codes/2022/12/20/du tch-corporate-
governance-code-2022) came into force on 1 January 2023.  
MFE has adopted the one-tier governance system which envisages only the Board of Directors as the 
governance body. Control of the management activities, carried out by the executive directors, is entrusted to the 
non-executive directors. There is no independent governance body in this system. 
The Shareholders' Meeting  represents all shareholders and has powers to deliberate, in ordinary and 
extraordinary sessions, on matters falling under its remit by law or by the Bylaws. The meeting is chaired by the 
Chairman of the Board of Directors or his substitute. However, the Board may also appoint a different person to 
chair the Shareholders' Meeting. If the chairmanship of the Shareholders' Meeting is not established, the 
Shareholders' Meeting shall elect a chairman provided that, until such election has taken place, the chairmanship 
is assumed by a member of the Board appointed for this purpose by the directors present at the Shareholders' 
Meeting. The resolutions of the Shareholders' Meeting, taken in accordance with the law and the Company Bylaws, 
are binding on all members. See the “Profile and activity" section of the present Report for a breakdown of the 
share ownership structure.  
The Board of Directors is the collective body of MFE responsible for administration of the company. It plays a 
key role in the Company’s organisation, overseeing functions and responsibility for its strategic and organisational 
guidelines, checking the existence of controls necessary to monitor the performance of the Company and Group. 
The system of delegation of powers is such that the central role of the Board is maintained within the Company's 
 

Page 51:
 
3 ▪ Ethics, Integrity and Transparency in business activities SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 
 
47 
organisation. The Board of Directors is invested with the powers provided by the law and by the Bylaws. In 
addition, the Board performs the activities assigned to it by the DCGC. In particular, the Executive Directors are in 
charge of the day-to-day management of affairs relating to the company while the Non -Executive Directors must 
monitor the fulfilment by the Executive Directors of their duties as well as the general performance of the 
management and the business connected to it. 
The Board of Directors met eight times in 2023. On 31 December 2023, the Board comprised 15 members: Fedele 
Confalonieri, Pier Silvio Berlusconi, Stefania Bariatti, Marina Berlusconi, Marina Brogi, Raffaele Cappiello, 
Costanza Esclapon de Villeneuve, Giulio Gallazzi, Marco Giordani, Gina Nieri, Danilo P ellegrino, Alessandra 
Piccinino, Niccolò Querci, Stefano Sala, Carlo Secchi. 
It should also be noted that the Board of Directors comprises 60% men and 40% women.  
On 28 September 2021, the Board of Directors set up four internal Board Committees: the Audit Committee, the 
Nomination and Remuneration Committee and, on a voluntary basis, the Environmental Social and Governance 
Committee and the Related Parties Transactions Committee. 
Since 2017, the Board of Directors has been responsible for ensuring that the Sustainability Report is drawn up 
and published in compliance with the provisions of Directive 2014/95/EU and Legislative Decree 254/2016. 
Following the Transfer, the Audit Commi ttee is responsible, among other things, for assisting the Board by 
providing advice on the disclosure of financial and non-financial information by the Company and the monitoring 
and assessment of reporting on ESG goals and programmes.  
The Audit Committee, pursuant to provision 1.5.1 of the DCGC, also deals with the preparatory work regarding 
supervision of the integrity and quality of the Company’s financial reporting and the effectiveness of the Company’s 
internal risk management and c ontrol systems; it assists the Board by providing advice on compliance, on the 
Company’s part, with applicable laws and regulations, on auditing the Company’s internal risk management and 
control systems, on the recommendation for the nomination of the external auditor, on relations with internal and 
external auditors, as well as compliance with their recommendations and subsequent observations, the financing 
of the Company, the application of information and communication technology by the Company, includi ng risks 
relating to IT security and the Company’s tax policy. 
The Environmental Social and Governance Committee  provides the Board with initial advice that aims to 
support the Board in drawing up the Company’s environmental, social and governance policies in accordance with 
its strategy. To this end, the Environmental Social and Governance Committee can bring specif ic environmental, 
social and governance goals to the attention of the Board of Directors.  
The decision to pursue these goals or otherwise and the corresponding implementation programmes are left to 
the Board and to the management of the Company respectively.  
The monitoring and assessment of achievement of the Company’s environmental, social and governance goals and 
the implementation of the related programmes are periodically assessed by the Audit Committee and the related 
results are included in its report to the Board of Directors. 
During the year, in line with a consolidated practice within the company and in order to promote knowledge by 
Non-Executive Directors of the internationalisation strategies and specific business and corporate governance

48 
issues, the Company organised various Induction meetings involving the Company’s management and external 
consultants. 
The Environmental Social and Governance Committee met once during 2023 and carried out the following 
activities:  
- noted and shared the progress of the projects and proposed initiatives for 2023, sharing the objectives contained 
in the Sustainability Project, which outlines initiatives in the areas: 
 Environmental: workspace reorganisation, green car fleet, sustainable mobility, photovoltaics, Green 
Audiovisual certification for the Le Iene, Striscia la Notizia and Dritto e Rovescio productions; 
  Social: training, welfare, communication, content monitoring – in particular the project with the Politecnico 
di Milano currently underway to develop an Artificial Intelligence model to calculate the ESG impact of 
productions; 
 Governance: performance measurement, green procurement; 
 
- approved the Committee’s Activity Report, including the Evaluation of the Committee itself; 
duly reported to the Board of Directors on the activities carried out. 
For more detailed information on the company's governance structure, including the composition of the corporate 
governance bodies of Group companies, diversity in governance bodies and remuneration policy for the members 
of these bodies, the reader is refe rred to the Report on Operations, Corporate Governance Report and 
Compensation Report, which are available on the https://www.mfemediaforeurope.com/en/ website. 
 
3.2  ETHICS AND INTEGRITY IN BUSINESS 
CODE OF ETHICS  
As indicated in paragraph 1.3 above, the Code of Ethics defines the values which the MFE Group cherishes, accepts 
and shares at every level in the pursuit of its business activities.  
With reference to the Mediaset S.p.A. company and its subsidiaries under Italian law, the current version of the  
Code of Ethics was approved during 2019. In September 2021 MFE-Mediaforeurope N.V., the holding company 
under Dutch law, then went on to adopt a Code of Ethics. The companies under Spanish law belonging to the MFE 
Group have implemented their own Còdigo Etico, based on the parent Company’s, the latest version of which was 
approved on 24 July 2019. 

Page 53:
 
3 ▪ Ethics, Integrity and Transparency in business activities SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 
 
49 
The principles and provisions of the Code of Ethics are binding on directors, internal auditors, employees and all 
persons working for/with the Group in any capacity, regardless of the nature of their employment relationship, 
even temporary, with the company (e.g. employees, suppliers, clients etc.). 
Respect for the principles and values enshrined in the Code of Ethics is of fundamental importance for the correct 
operation, reliable management and image of the MFE Group5.  
All activities of the Group are therefore pursued in a spirit of fair competition, in full respect for the laws and 
regulations of the jurisdictions of all countries in which the individual companies operate, and for the ethical 
principles commonly applied in the pursuit of business, such as honesty, fairness,  propriety, transparency and 
good faith. 
The MFE Group propagates the principles and values enshrined in its Code of Ethics via targeted information 
campaigns, especially with regard to its corporate bodies, staff and employees, encouraging them to apply and 
strictly observe these principles and values.  
The Code of Ethics is provided to all employees of the Group through dedicated communication published on the 
company intranet together with their salary statements, and to new recruits at the moment of recruitment. 
The Code of Ethics is also published and appropriately highlighted in the “Compliance” section of the MFE 
Group’s website (www.mfemediaforeurope.com/it/governance/compliance/)6, in English and Italian.  
The MFE Group also implements training activities addressing its Code of Ethics, and with particular reference 
to the companies under Italian law, as required under the administrative liability provisions (Legislative Decree 
231/01) relating to the Compliance Programmes pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/01 implemented by Italian 
Group companies7. According to circumstances and requirements, training plans are administered in classroom 
courses or via special e-learning modules. 
Following its adoption and subsequent amendments8, the Code of Ethics was distributed to its different recipients 
including both employees and signatories to employment and supply contracts and, more generally, all parties 
conducting business relations with Group companies. Contracts with third parties contain specific clauses with an 
explicit formal reference to the Code of Ethics (as well as the Compliance Programmes pursuant to Legislative 
Decree 231/01 in the case of Italian companies), stating that failure to observe its provisions constitutes a breach 
of contractual obligations, giving rise to the right to terminate existing legal relationships without prejudice to any 
compensation for damages.  
 
5 Including foreign investee companies 
6 With reference to companies governed by Italian law, the Code of Ethics is also published on the company intranet, in the “Compliance 231” section. 
7 The companies under Italian law which have currently implemented their own Compliance Programmes under Legislative Decree 231 /01 are: Mediaset S.p.A., R.T.I. S.p.A., Publitalia ’80 S.p.A., Digitalia ’08 
S.r.l., Mediamond S.p.A., Medusa Film S.p.A., Taodue S.r.l., Elettronica Industriale S.p.A., Radio Mediaset S.p.A., Radio Studio 105 S.p.A., Virgin Radio Italy S.p.A., Monradio S.r.l., RMC Italia S.p.A., Radio Subasio

WHISTLEBLOWING REPORT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
The MFE Group undertakes to promote a corporate culture based on ethical behaviour, respecting the principles 
of fairness, propriety, responsibility and legality and consequently rejects and deplores the use of illegitimate or 
incorrect behaviour to achieve its economic objectives.  
To ensure the maintenance, observance and compliance with these principles and values as well as to increasingly 
encourage the dissemination of a culture of legality within the organisation, organisational and control tools are 
adopted to prevent violati on of legal provisions, of the principles and values expressed in the Code of Ethics, in 
the compliance programmes and in the company procedures in force in each instance, through constant 
supervision of their observance and implementation. 
From this perspective, the MFE Group – also in the belief that promoting this culture and maintaining these values 
cannot be separated from the active and responsible participation of all stakeholders who can contribute to help 
prevent the commission of offenses and irregularities within the organisation – has implemented the law in force 
in the countries in which it operates, both at EU level (EU Directive 2019/1937) and at national level (Legislative 
Decree 10 March 2023, no. 24, Dutch Whistleblower Protection Act, Ley 20 febrero 2023, no. 2) and adapted its own 
report ( whistleblowing) management system which allows anyone interested to report  – through specific 
internal channels – offenses and/or irregularities, even suspected ones, ensuring the absolute confidentiality of 
the identity of the whistleblowers and guaranteeing them maximu m protection against retaliatory behaviour or 
any form of discrimination or penalisation (“Whistleblowing System”).  
For this purpose specific company procedures have been adopted in addition to the “ MFE Group Whistleblowing 
General Principles”, namely: 
- MFE_PO-02 of 26 September 2023 (“ Whistleblowing Policy”) for the Group’s holding company under 
Dutch law, MFE-MEDIAFOREUROPE N.V.; 
- LGO MD-HO 125 of 15 November 2023 (“ Whistleblowing Report Management”) for Mediaset S.p.A. and 
companies under Italian law; 
- the “ Procedimiento de Utilización Y Gestión Del Buzón Ético Corporativo ” applicable to Grupo Audiovisual 
Mediaset España Comunicacion and its Spanish subsidiaries.  
The management of the Whistleblowing System or the activities relating to the process of receiving, analysing, 
managing and processing reports have been entrusted by the Boards of Directors to specific bodies, as indicated 
below. 
- for MFE-Mediaforeurope N.V., for Mediaset and its subsidiaries under Italian law, the Whistleblowing 
Committee has been identified, comprising 3 (three) members, two of whom are internal (Internal 
Auditing Director and the Director of Compliance, Labour Law and Extraordinary Transactions) and one 
external9; 
- for Grupo Audiovisual Mediaset España Comunicación and its Spanish subsidiaries, the Unidad de 
Cumplimiento y Prevención de Delitos  was identified, which entrusted the management of the 
system to the Corporate Director General. 
The internal channels specifically implemented for receiving reports are:

51 
- IT platform (also through voice messaging); 
- e-mail addresses; 
- PEC certified email addresses; 
- direct personal meeting with the bodies identified by the various companies, at the specific request of 
the reporting party, formulated using the above channels.  
The details and information relating to the use of internal channels and, in general, to the company procedures 
for making reports can be found in the specific section of the MFE Group corporate website, available on the page 
www.mfemediaforeurope.com/en/governance/compliance/10  
In line with Italy, the MFE Group in Spain has adopted its own Code of Ethics, both for the Holding Company and 
for the Subsidiaries. 
The Code of Ethics was updated in 2023, incorporating the guiding principles regarding the production of 
entertainment content and reality shows. Likewise, all policies were updated in 2023 in order to realign to the new 
corporate situation of the Group, resulting from the merger and creation of MFE-Mediaforeurope. 
Furthermore, the Code of Ethics establishes the criteria and rules of action to avoid situations that could generate 
conflicts of interest. In this sense, to avoid potential conflicts of interest in creating and/or disseminating content, 
all content creati on assignments are reviewed, analysed and finally approved by the Group’s Purchasing 
Committee.  
The Code of Ethics and the Compliance Programme establish the fundamental principles and values that govern 
the Company and all employees, managers and members of the Board of Directors are subject to it, as well as all 
persons, natural or legal, who maint ain any kind of relationship with MFE Spain in the performance of their 
professional or commercial activities. 
In compliance with Law 2/2023, which regulates whistleblowing, in 2023 the policy for the use and management 
of the company’s ethical mailbox was updated and a procedure was drawn up to manage psychological risk and 
bullying in the workplace. 
COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS 
As a supplier of audiovisual services and a radio broadcaster, the MFE Group scrupulously observes Italian law in 
the pursuit of its business activities, including requirements of a regulatory and self-regulatory nature. 
To prevent violations of applicable legislation, the Group scrupulously observes the requirements on air time and 
the protection of minors  in the advertising content carried in its radio and television broadcasts. The 
following requirements apply in regard to these issues:  
 training of personnel responsible for programming, production and broadcasting; 
 general oversight of programming activities, using a delegation system conferring the necessary powers 
 
10 For companies under Italian law, this content is also present on the company intranet. 

Page 56:
 
 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 3 ▪ Ethics, Integrity and Transparency in business activities 
 
52 
on those responsible for broadcast content;  
 advisory and supervisory action by the Legal Affairs Department  and Regulations and Corporate 
Compliance and the Directorate for Documentation and Institutional Analysis , both from a general 
perspective and addressing specific programmes or individual issues, with the purpose of identifying critical 
issues and taking any appropriate preventive action wherever possible. 
The Directorate for Regulation and Institutional Requirements also periodically publishes a manual (“linear and 
non-linear audiovisual media services manual”). This summarises and interprets the complex legislative and 
regulatory framework governing the programming and broadcasting of content on various platforms (TV, radio, 
OTT, internet, etc.). The manual is designed for everyday use, and is also valuable as a guide for programmers to 
identify critical issues. 
Training meetings are organised cyclically on new regulations and on the correct methods of implementing the 
programmes, involving all company departments involved in the creation and dissemination of the programmes.  
The MFE Group operates in an intensively regulated sector, and its relations with regulatory bodies and industry 
associations are of primary importance. The Group defends its legitimate interests before local and international 
administrative powers.  
To do so, the Group is a member of various industry associations created to promote the shared interests of 
commercial TV stations on the national, EU and international levels: 
 Association of Commercial Television in Europe 
(ACT) 
 Associazioni Produttori Audiovisivi (APA)

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST  
The Code of Ethics includes special provisions on conflicts of interest 11. All recipients of the Code of Ethics must 
scrupulously observe the laws and regulations on conflicts of interest, especially with regard to the pursuit of their 
business activities and their own duties/functions. In pursuing the interests and general objectives of the Group, 
they must abstain from conduct and action incompatible with their obligations in connection with their relations 
with MFE Group companies.  
Consequently, in the occurrence of situations or activities in which the recipients of the Code of Ethics may have 
interests (directly or via third parties) which are or could be in conflict with those of the MFE Group, these 
recipients must immediately in form their superiors or the designated bodies, with reference to companies 
governed by Italian law, the Supervisory and Control bodies, where these exist, and respect the decisions taken 
by the Group in this regard. 
With regard to the management of transactions concluded between related parties, the Board of Directors 
highlights the voluntary establishment – as not required by the laws and regulations in force in the Netherlands – 
of the Related Parties Transactions Committee and the adoption on 28 September 2021 of the Policy on related -
party transactions (subsequently amended on 21 December 2021) in compliance with applicable laws and 
regulations.  
The MFE Group is therefore committed to taking all measures necessary for avoiding situations which may present 
conflicts of interest.12  
The MFE Group also establishes the necessary measures to ensure observance of the regulations concerning equal 
access of political entities to television and radio in application of the principles of pluralism of information. In 
overly simple terms, this a ctivity takes the form of sending internal company circulars to its broadcasting 
structures, including news directors, precisely indicating the requirement to observe regulations concerning equal 
access of political entities to television and to implement the measures issued by the Authority. 
Law no. 215 of 20 July 2004 “Requirements on the resolution of conflicts of interest” requires that holders of 
government offices (President of the Council of Ministers, Ministers, Deputy Ministers, Undersecretaries of State 
and Extraordinary Commissioners of the Government) devote themselves in the performance of their duties to the 
public interest and refrain from implementing acts and participating in collegiate deliberations in situations 
characterised by conflict of interest. 
 
11 Both in the Code of Ethics adopted by Mediaset S.p.A. and its Italian subsidiaries during 2019 and in the “Code of Ethics” adopted by MFE in 2021, there is a specific provision on conflict of interest, according 
to which “the Recipients, in the context of their dealings with the same (i.e. Group), are required to comply with the laws and regulat ions governing the conflict of interests.” In addition, they “must pursue the objectives and 
general interests of the Group in the performance of their business activities and their own duties/functions” and “abstain from activities, conduct and action incompatible with their obligations in connection with their relations 
with the same”. 
According to the Code of Ethics, purely by way of example, the following situations may constitute conflicts of interest: (i) having economic or financial interests, including through family members, in Suppliers, 
Clients or competitors; (ii) using one's role within the Group or the information or data acquired in the performance of one's business activities and/or own duties or  functions to one's own advantage or that 
of third parties contrary to the interests of the Group; (iii) performing business activities or any kind (including services or intellectual work) for Suppliers, Clients, competitors and/or for third parties contrary 
to the interests of the Group; (iv) initiating negotiations and/or entering into agreements – in the name of and/or on behalf o f the Group – with family members or partners as counterparties, or with 
counterparties of which the Addressee is, in any capacity, owner or in which they are in any case an interested party. 3. Add ressees must without delay, taking the circumstances into account, inform their 
superior or, if applicable to the specific case, the person to whom they are obliged to report situations in which they may, directly or due to third parties, have interests (even only potentially) in conflict with 
those of the Group.  
12 The Group undertakes to guarantee, in all possible circumstances, compliance with the Law of 20 July 2004 no. 215 “ Requirements on the resolution of conflicts of interest ”, and with AGCOM ruling no. 
417/04/CONS “Regulations on the resolution of conflicts of interest” (amended by ruling no. 392/05/CONS 682/11/CONS).

According to the law, there is a conflict of interest when the holder of government office participates in the 
adoption of an act or omits a required act, finding themselves in situations incompatible with their public role, 
due to personal or professional interests contrary to the impartiality required in managing the interests concerned. 
The same law provides that both the Italian Antitrust Authority and the Italian Communications Authority have the 
jurisdiction to resolve conflicts of interest, with supervisory, investigative and disciplinary functions. 
In particular, with Resolution no. 417/04/CONS “Regulations for the resolution of conflicts of interest” (as 
amended by Resolutions no. 392/05/CONS 682/11/CONS) AGCOM verifies that companies operating in the 
integrated communications system (SIC) and that report to the holder of government offices, spouse or relatives 
up to the second degree, or subject to the control of the same subjects, do not engage in condu ct that provides 
privileged support to the holder of government offices. 
“Privileged support” means any form of advantage, direct or indirect, political, economic or image -related 
provided to the holder of government offices by the above-mentioned companies, both during election campaigns 
and outside these periods. 
The AGCM carries out its supervision of conflicts of interest through Resolution No. 13779 of 16 November 2004 
- “Regulation on conflicts of interest” (amended by Resolution No. 26042 of 18 May 2016).  
Conflict of interest may exist in two distinct cases. 
The first (conflict by reason of incompatibility) occurs whenever the holder of a government office, who is already 
in a situation of incompatibility, adopts or participates in the adoption of an act or omits an act that is required, in 
the exercise of their governmental function. 
The second hypothesis (conflict by reason of impact on assets) concerns the adoption or participation in the 
adoption of collegial acts, through which the holder of a government office favours himself, his spouse or his 
relatives up to the second degree, harming the public interest at the same time. 
With regard to Inside Information, it is finally noted that, on 18 September 2021, following the completed 
transfer of the Company to Amsterdam (Netherlands), the update of the related Procedure was approved 13. This 
acknowledges, among other things, that the competent authority for the purposes of insider trading and delay in 
disclosing privileged information remains the Italian Market Supervisory Authority (CONSOB). The Inside 
Information Procedure governs the internal management and communication to the public of inside information 
concerning the parent company and its subsidiaries, as well as the operation of the “Register of persons with 
access to inside information”. The Inside Information Management and Communication Procedure is an essential 
component of the MFE-MEDIAFOREUROPE N.V. internal control and risk management system and part of the rules 
and prescriptions adopted by MFE-MEDIAFOREUROPE N.V. for the purpose of preventing offences.  
The above Procedure is binding for the directors, statutory auditors and employees of the parent Company and 
Subsidiaries as well as the external persons/entities who act in the name of and on behalf of the same – with the 
exception of the listed subsidiary Grupo Audiovisual Mediaset España Comunicación S.A., obliged to keep 
 
13 Adopted pursuant to the Market Abuse Regulation (EU No. 596/2014), in order to comply with the legal and regulatory provisions, including European ones, in force regarding the abuse of inside information.

55 
their own Insider Register, to fulfil related requirements and to notify the reference market  – and who, in any 
capacity, have access to information regarding MFE and its subsidiaries. 
The Company has communicated the Inside Information Management and Communication Procedure to its 
personnel and that of its subsidiaries, including through publication on the company intranet and on its website 
and has also continued training on the proces s of managing significant inside information for the competent 
structures. 
The Code of Ethics includes special provisions on conflicts of interest 14. All recipients of the Code of Ethics must 
scrupulously observe the laws and regulations on conflicts of interest, especially with regard to the pursuit of their 
business activities and their own duties/functions. In pursuing the interests and general objectives of the Group, 
they must abstain from conduct and action incompatible with their obligations in connection with their relations 
with MFE Group companies.  
Consequently, in the occurrence of situations or activities in which the recipients of the Code of Ethics may have 
interests (directly or via third parties) which are or could be in conflict with those of the MFE Group, these 
recipients must immediately in form their superiors or the designated bodies, with exclusive reference to 
companies governed by Italian law, the Supervisory and Control bodies, where these exist, and respect the 
decisions taken by the Group in this regard. 
The MFE Group is therefore committed to taking all measures necessary for avoiding situations which may present 
conflicts of interest.  
Furthermore, it should be noted that the “Related Parties Procedure ”, adopted on 21 December 2021, was 
updated on 22 November 2023; the relevant text can be found on the MFE Group corporate website, in the 
“Governance/Corporate regulations” section.  
The MFE Group also establishes the necessary measures to ensure observance of the regulations concerning equal 
access of political entities to television and radio in application of the principles of pluralism of information. In 
overly simple terms, this a ctivity takes the form of sending internal company circulars to its broadcasting 
structures, including news directors, precisely indicating the requirement to observe regulations concerning equal 
access of political entities to television and to implement the measures issued by the competent authorities. 
Via its regulatory compliance department, the MFE Group in Spain  works to detect and monitor potential 
conflicts of interest between the company and its directors. This matter is regulated by the Code of Ethics and by 
the Group's internal code of conduct, which both provide mechanisms for identifying and resolving pote ntial 
conflicts of interest, thereby preventing conduct liable to damage the company or its shareholders. 
In 2021, the “Related Parties” procedure was updated to adapt it to the changes introduced by the new Law on 
 
14 Specifically, there is a provision on conflict of interest, according to which “the Recipients, in the context of their dealings with the same (i.e. Group), are required to comply with the laws and regulations governing the 
conflict of interests.” In addition, they “must pursue the objectives and general interests of the Group in the performance of their business activities and their own d uties/functions” and “abstain from activities, conduct and 
action incompatible with their obligations in connection with their relations with the same”. 
According to the Code of Ethics, purely by way of example, the following situations may constitute conflicts of interest: (i) having economic or financial interests, including through family members, in Suppliers, 
Clients or competitors; (ii) using one's role within the Group or the information or data acquired in the performance of one's business activities and/or own duties or  functions to one's own advantage or that 
of third parties contrary to the interests of the Group; (iii) performing business activities or any kind (including services or intellectual work) for Suppliers, Clients, competitors and/or for third parties contrary 
to the interests of the Group; (iv) initiating negotiations and/or entering into agreements – in the name of and/or on behalf o f the Group – with family members or partners as counterparties, or with 
counterparties of which the Addressee is, in any capacity, owner or in which they are in any case an interested party. 3. Add ressees must without delay, taking the circumstances into account, inform their 
superior or, if applicable to the specific case, the person to whom they are obliged to report situations in which they may, directly or due to third parties, have interests (even only potentially) in conflict with 
those of the Group.

56 
companies (5/2021, 12 April - "LSC") with particular reference to the approval and communication of transactions 
carried out with related parties; for certain types of significant transactions, the authorisation of the Shareholders’ 
Meeting is required as well as publication on the Corporate website. 
Generally, all transactions with “Related Parties” are always in the main interest of the Group, under market 
conditions and in accordance with the principle of transparency and non-discrimination towards third parties. 
All other cases must in any case be authorised by the Board of Directors itself.  
Finally, to avoid potential conflicts of interest in the creation and dissemination of content, all related commissions 
are subject to the review, analysis and approval of the Group's Acquisitions Committee or, if necessary, of the 
Board of Directors. 
In 2022, the “Compliance” protocol was updated to include offences concerning public officials. A new section 
concerning the responsibilities of Senior Management in these cases was also added. This protocol has been 
approved by the Compliance Department. 
As indicated previously, during 2023 the MFE Code of Ethics in Spain was updated for the purposes of managing 
the different cases of conflict of interest that may arise within the company’s operations. 
3.3  THE INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK 
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM  
As an integral part of its Internal Control and Risk Management System, in both Italy and Spain the MFE Group has 
implemented a Risk Management model to enable a better response to the risks to which it is structurally exposed 
and adopted the ERM (Enterprise Risk Management Framework) methodology  for this purpose, already 
identified as the benchmark methodology by the Guidelines for the Internal Control and Risk Management System.  
The ERM model identifies the following types of risk factors which may be important from a perspective of 
sustainability over the medium and long terms: 
Strategic risks , linked to both external and internal factors capable of structurally threatening the business 
model and the sustainability of the competitive advantages acquired, significantly compromising the achievement 
of medium/long-term objectives, financial strength and the creation of economic value for shareholders: 
 external and industry risks, mainly attributable to the evolution of the economic cycle, the evolution of the 
intermediate and final reference markets (consisting of the demand for consumption of audiovisual and 
entertainment content and the demand for advertising space), the evolution of competitive context and the 
connected dynamics of availability and contestability of the key production factors made up of content, 
strategic artistic resources and the evolution of the reference regulatory context on an international and 
national basis; 
 internal risks connected to the implementation of strategic guidelines and directions in order to counter the 
structural maturity of the characteristic reference markets, leveraging the ability, by managing the model of 
broadcast offering based on original self-produced content with highly local characteristics, to generate stable 

Page 61:
 
3 ▪ Ethics, Integrity and Transparency in business activities SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 
 
57 
and high coverage of commercially relevant audiences and on a constant activity of optimising and increasing 
the efficiency of the related processes with a view to flexible management and cost control, also acting in an 
evolutionary sense, including throug h partnerships and alliances, to develop new broadcasting and 
commercial models and the required managerial, professional and technological skills also with a view to 
developing a corporate and organisational model that allows the pursuit of supranational dimensional growth 
strategies. 
Operational and process risks mainly attributable to: 
 risks concerning business interruption, IT security and crisis management; 
 financial risks connected to the management of financing needs and interest and exchange rate fluctuations; 
 risks associated with the failure to protect intellectual property rights; 
 risks connected to the management of legal disputes. 
Governance and Compliance risks  mainly attributable to compliance with industry laws and regulations 
required in conducting business, financial and non-financial reporting, management of ESG factors connected to 
environmental policies (management and control of energy consumption, efflu ents and waste and emissions, 
compliance with the regulations related to the installation of radio and television transmission equipment in 
relation to compliance with the limits set for electromagnetic emissions) and the main areas of responsibility 
related to Human Resource management policies (health and safety, non-discrimination and protection of human 
rights, diversity and equal opportunities, training, industrial relations)  
With reference to the risk factors identified, the Group first defines its Risk Appetite, that is, the level of exposure 
to both internal and external factors of uncertainty and variability that the management is willing to take on and 
accept in its decision -making and management process. Starting from the system of principles and values, 
recognised in its own codes of conduct and in the main organisational guidelines and operating procedures, this 
appetite is defined and adapted differently for the differe nt categories of risk, in an inverse relationship with 
respect to the capacity for control and the levers that the management can apply to these factors and in relation 
to the medium -term need to ensure the safeguarding of certain parameters that structura lly define its market 
positioning and its sustainability and financial self-sufficiency.  
The ESG risk profiles are assessed taking into account the general reference context (also in terms of benchmark 
with leading operators in the TMT sector), monitoring of the Group’s main initiatives and projects in these areas 
and the main results linked to feedback from the main stakeholders. 
In the context of mapping the risks subject to periodic monitoring and evaluation by management, these ESG 
(Environmental, Social and Governance) factors  are mainly identified as and included in the category of 
Governance and Compliance risks, with respect to which the Group effectively expresses a substantial and 
preventive total aversion to risk, equipping itself with appropriate organisational tools and adequate internal and 
external skills for their management and mitigation. Typical governance risks, such as the risk of non-compliance 
with laws and regulations, of inadequate conferral of powers and delegations or of inappropriate remuneration 
policies, are mitigated through the implementation of a consolidated system of Corporate Governance, 
implementing the provisions of the Self -Regulatory Code envisaged for listed companies and national and 

Page 62:
 
 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 3 ▪ Ethics, Integrity and Transparency in business activities 
 
58 
international best practices as well as the relevant regulatory provisions.  
ESG factors also represent, in the context of the social and environmental responsibility profiles at the basis of the 
management’s conduct, the reference criteria adopted in managing the main operational and operating processes 
and in particular in evaluating investment and technical innovation initiatives and projects, in the definition and 
planning of its overall broadcast offering and social communications campaigns, also in relation to greater 
sensitivity of end users and advertising investors to ESG issues and in the management and policies of developing 
human resources, a strategic central factor for the Group. 
The nature and main activities of management and mitigation implemented by management in relation to these 
risk areas are described below. 
Risks connected with reputation and relations with stakeholders . One of the MFE Group’s key strategic 
objectives is the ability to maintain and increase content innovation and brand value perception over time in 
keeping with the development of its business model. In relation to this objective, there is a risk of estab lishing 
broadcasting and communications strategies and initiatives aimed at the financial market and the public that could 
have an adverse impact on the perception of the MFE brand. This risk i s primarily monitored via constant 
supervision designed to ensure full oversight of certain processes, and in particular: 
 programme scheduling, monitored through daily analysis of television viewer behaviour, both in terms of 
audience share and rating of broadcast programmes, and, consequently, of viewer perception of the editorial 
approach adopted by the networks, as well as through ongoing initiatives designed to ensure the protection 
and respect of minors and attention to issues of social responsibility; 
 reporting processes to the financial market and to the public; 
 production processes and their ability to generate high-quality innovative products. 
Risks connected to the management of human resources. With regard to the risks associated with the 
management of human resources, the Group acknowledges the vital role played by human resources and the 
importance of cultivating transparent relations based on reciprocal loyalty and trust, and the application o f the 
rules of conduct dictated by the Code of Ethics. 
 Management and cooperation in working relations is based on respect for the rights of workers and the full 
recognition of their contributions in a perspective of promoting their professional growth and development. 
In particular, in the present competitive context characterised by profound change driven by digital transformation 
processes, triggered by advances in technology which are significantly impacting the sectors in which the Group 
conducts its business (creat ion and distribution of video content, sale of advertising space), the Group is 
increasingly focused on the aspects of recruiting, training and cultivation of human resources . Special 
emphasis is also placed on identifying talent and the need to create car eer development trajectories which 
reinforce expertise in areas of key importance to the Group, particularly technology and the conception and 
creation of broadcasting products, specific training, the definition and development of career trajectories and the 
definition of incentives plans. In pursuit of these objectives, the Group implements systems for evaluating 
annual performances based on a clear definition of shared objectives which can be measured in numeric, 
financial and economic terms as well as individually and qualitatively. Also, to promote a positive corporate culture 

Page 63:
 
3 ▪ Ethics, Integrity and Transparency in business activities SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 
 
59 
and climate, the Group constantly strives to improve internal communication flows via advanced, market-standard 
collaboration tools (new corporate intranet project, Office 365 and instant messaging services for all company 
employees), as well as introducing innovative and flexible ways of working (smart working). 
Risks related to environmental policies 
At present, the impact generated and experienced by the Group in the area of Climate Change does not represent 
a materially critical aspect for the Group, either directly or indirectly in both relative and absolute terms. The Group 
is in any case committed  to ongoing and precise compliance with and monitoring of the development of 
regulation in this area, and has initiated a process aimed at identifying and implementing low-environmental-
impact technical investment and replacement solutions directed towards  energy saving and limiting and 
optimising direct emissions. In particular, sustainable mobility initiatives were launched to this end in 2022, an 
area in which the Group, after having introduced various measures in previous years to improve employee 
transport to the main company premises, has focused its commitment on renewing the company car fleet. In 2022 
it completed the construction of major car park charging station infrastructure at its Cologno Monzese 
headquarters. This will facilitate conversion o f the company fleet to hybrid or full -electric models, capable of 
producing positive impact in reducing CO2 emissions from company cars. 
As part of analysing the technical criteria for a substantial contribution to climate change adaptation, the physical 
climate risks aligned with the specifications described in Appendix A of the Taxonomy were also analysed for the 
first time. These analyses were performed with the goal of verifying the degree of resilience from the perspective 
of operational continuity of the operative structures for the Group’s eligible activities in both Italy and Spain in 
relation to certain categories of significant risks identified among those included in the appendix to the Regulation 
that may significantly compromise the operability of physical and technological structures in the coming years and 
compromise the business continuity of the Group’s activities. These analyses were performed through a specific 
risk assessment, considering forecast climate scenarios to 2030 that i dentify, in the most pessimistic cases with 
further increases in average temperatures, a high risk of hydrogeological phenomena near the areas where the 
Group’s operational sites are located, analysing the physical adaptation solutions that the Group alrea dy has for 
addressing them. 
Given the nature of its transmission activity, the Group in Italy is also exposed to the risk of generating 
electromagnetic fields . Exposure to electrical, magnetic and electromagnetic fields is governed by Italian 
Framework Law no. 36 of 2001 and Italian Presidential Decree of the Council of Ministers of 8/7/2003, which set 
limits on exposure of the population to electrical, magnetic and electromagnetic fields with a frequency ranging 
from between 100 kHz to 300 GHz. The exposure limit is the value of the electrical, magnetic and electromagnetic 
field, regarded as the emission value, set to protect health against severe effects, which must not be exceeded 
under any condition of exposure of the population and workers. 
In addition, this attention value must not be exceeded in residential areas, schools and places of extended stay. 
The quality goals are: 
 location criteria, urban planning standards, requirements and incentives for the use of the best available 
technologies, as indicated in regional laws; 

Page 64:
 
 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 3 ▪ Ethics, Integrity and Transparency in business activities 
 
60 
 the electrical, magnetic and electromagnetic field values, set by the government for the progressive mitigation 
of exposure to those fields. 
Despite widespread concerns among the population linked to the effects of electromagnetic fields, the World 
Health Organization and the latest scientific literature have concluded that current evidence provides no proof of 
health damage resulting from exposure to weak electromagnetic fields. Therefore compliance with the exposure 
limits recommended by domestic and international guidelines enables monitoring of the risks of exposure to 
electromagnetic fields which may be harmful to health. 
Moreover, the limits under Italian regulations are up to 100 times lower than those set by the International 
Commission on Non Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and applied in the rest of Europe.

The critical factors for constructing transmission equipment and adhering to legal limits are: 
 the need to emit high power levels; 
 the difficulty of erecting tall towers for the installation of transmission antennas; 
 the proximity of housing to transmitters or the issue by municipalities of new building permits for the 
construction of housing close to plants; 
 the presence on the same site of other broadcasters (particularly radio broadcasters), which can result in the 
limits being exceeded when emissions are aggregated. 
The Group’s installations are designed, developed and operated in compliance with Italian law. In accordance 
with the Group’s operating practices, all necessary measures are taken, when designing new sites or modifying 
existing ones, to keep the electromagnetic field levels within the parameters set by the regulations. In particular: 
 the construction of tall towers for transmission antennas in order to keep them as far as possible from areas 
accessible to the population; 
 improved orientation of transmission antennas, to concentrate the signal on the area to be served and use 
less power minimising the electromagnetic radiation detectable at ground level (areas accessible to the 
population); 
 identification, where possible, of installation sites far from residential areas; 

Page 65:

61 
 submission of the project for prior assessment and authorisation by local authorities and regional 
environmental protection agencies, as required by the Code of Electronic Communications (Italian Legislative 
Decree 259/03). 
In addition, specific company departments are responsible for mapping installations with a risk of exceeding the 
electromagnetic field limits and establishing monitoring plans as well as, where necessary, the use of internal and 
external resources (certified external advisors). 
Using the same risk management model, implemented in 2007 and regularly updated each year, the MFE Group 
in Spain implements an assessment process designed to identify risks in its own industrial context.  
Every year, the Board of Directors of MFE in Spain assesses the risks the Group is exposed to, and evaluates the 
internal control systems implemented, identifying possible areas for improvement. In particular, the Internal Audit 
and Compliance departments evaluate the specific risks to which the MFE Group in Spain is exposed, assessing 
the likelihood of occurrence and extent of impact and directly involving the various corporate departments in the 
evaluation process. The Risk Committee, whose members are ma naging directors, is responsible for managing 
executive risk management functions in everyday business activities.  
The compliance function reviews the risk map annually. 
In particular, new areas of risk are identified and related safeguards are determined with regard to the criminal 
liability of legal persons in the area of respect for workers’ rights, respect for the rights of minors, safety in the 
workplace and also corporate governance rules. 
The risk associated with the possible impacts of climate change, both physical and transition, has been 
incorporated into the MFE Group’s Risk Management System. 
The risk map has been verified and audited by a leading legal consultancy (AENOR). 
3.4  PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION AND 
INFORMATION SECURITY 
3.4.1 PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA 
The protection of privacy and the data and personal information pertaining to clients and subscribers is one of the 
main priorities of the MFE Group, including through appropriate security measures. 
The MFE Group in Italy has always paid great attention to the protection of personal data and, with European 
Regulation 679/2016 (GDPR) coming into force, has reinforced its Privacy Compliance Programme.  
The Group has prepared a “ Privacy Compliance Programme – General Principles of Personal Data Protection ” 
Organisational Guideline that regulates and describes the Privacy Compliance Programme adopted by the Group 
as well as the principles relating to personal data protection management, also in order to prevent and/or reduce 
the penalties envisaged by current legislation on the subject. 

Page 66:
 
 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 3 ▪ Ethics, Integrity and Transparency in business activities 
 
62 
With the goal of pursuing the simultaneous promotion of the interests of all parties involved, the protection of 
personal data and the rights and freedoms of the data subjects, the Group has defined a specific series of 
Company Policies, Operating Instructions, Organisational Guidelines, and a Processing Register as the 
cornerstone and map of the rules and activities connected with processing. Together with the Intranet Privacy 
Portal and the constant personnel information and training activities, these are  part of an extensive privacy 
management system able to ensure the security of personal data and corporate information.  
The Data Protection Officer , the Privacy Department and the parties involved in various capacities based 
according to the Compliance Programme promote a culture founded on respect for privacy as a fundamental right 
of the individual, committing themselves to respect for people and the values of loyalty, tr ust, transparency and 
integration.  
The Group has also issued a Data Breach Organisational Guideline in the event of breaches that accidentally 
or unlawfully result in destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access to personal data. The Data 
Breach management plan was prepared in order to implement, where necessary, the action plan and any 
notification of the Supervisory Authority within 72 hours of identification of the breach as well as communication 
with the data subject should the rights and freedoms of the individual potentially be at risk.  
The MFE Group in Spain is scrupulously implementing the protection of personal data and content in the sphere 
of corporate management. The primary instrument of implementation is the Code of Ethics, which addresses 
aspects relating to cybersecurity, data protection and confiden tiality. Using the Code of Ethics as their guide, the 
Data Protection Unit, the Internal Auditing Department and the technology division will develop other mechanisms 
determining the company's conduct in regard to data security. 
The Group also implements a corporate security policy which imposes procedures and regulations for the 
processing of personal data and confidentiality within the organisation. These procedures regulate access to and 
the processing of personal data in all d epartments, areas and management units of companies belonging to the 
Group, while also defining the security measures to be applied during the compilation of personal data to ensure 
the confidentiality of the latter. 
It also implemented a series of operating procedures for managing initiatives requiring the use of personal data: 
identification and authentication, remote access, access to applications and use of personal data files. These 
procedures are regularly updated to ensure their compliance with applicable legislation. 
In 2016, the MFE Group underwent conformity analysis in light of the General Data Protection Regulation on the 
protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such 
data, which came into effect on 25 May 2018. 
This analysis revealed the need for more work to bring the management model up to standard and for the 
introduction of specific measures of a technical, organisational and legal nature which were implemented in the 
following years. 
With regard to relations between company and citizens in terms of data protection, the MFE Group in Spain has 
defined and implemented an action protocol for guaranteeing the exercise of the rights of access, rectification, 
cancellation and objection. 

Page 67:
 
3 ▪ Ethics, Integrity and Transparency in business activities SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 
 
63 
This protocol describes in detail the areas affected by such rights, the channels through which Group users can 
exercise them, the procedure for replying to requests, special cases for the exercise of rights, and notification of 
users of the successful outcome of their requests. 
3.4.2 INFORMATION SECURITY 
The MFE Group in Italy has also prepared an Organisational Guideline on Information Security Policy, and 
the protection of data in particular. These activities observe the following principles: 
 compliance with national and international legal requirements, with particular reference to Legislative 
Decree 231/2001, L.262/2005 on the protection of savings and financial markets regulations, and the 
European Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the processing of personal data. 
 safeguards on adequate measures of protection of data against threats, including cybersecurity; these 
measures are identified in accordance with the level of risk associated with the loss of confidentiality, integrity 
and availability of information. This protection must also be guaranteed in regard to relations with third 
parties. 
 protection of data against unauthorised access , while ensuring accessibility for legitimate purposes, 
with a suitable degree of traceability. 
In particular, in 2023 the strategy for Cyber Security envisaged the implementation and completion of specific 
initiatives in 4 areas of activity. 
 Cyber Defence 
With the aim of protecting services and users, the following activities have been promoted: 
• Strengthening and extending Cyber Threat Intelligence services in order to anticipate threats and prevent 
IT risks 
• Consolidation of the Security Operation Centre (SOC) infrastructure through the use of new tools, 
technologies and resources 
• Reinforcement of control measures on the external attack surface 
• Improved process and technologies for managing security vulnerabilities 
 Training and awareness 
To complement the technological protection initiatives, the following activities to raise employee awareness of 
cyber threats were completed: 
• Preparation and launch of a new digital self-defence campaign to protect against phishing risks, through the 
production of video content presented on the Intranet and company spaces (e.g. video wall), gamification 
activities, flyers and newsletters. 

Page 68:
 
 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 3 ▪ Ethics, Integrity and Transparency in business activities 
 
64 
• Redesign of the Cyber Security portal, accessible and available to all personnel 
• Provision of training courses to IT specialists in IT security and privacy 
• Execution of simulated phishing campaigns, also targeted for specific company areas 
 Risk Assessment 
In order to identify and mitigate the level of cyber risk associated with assets, services and third parties, the 
following activities were completed:  
• Expansion of the scope of supplier safety measures and standards verification, also through the use of new 
tools and assessments carried out by independent third parties 
• Extension of IT operational continuity assessment activity for the main critical platforms 
• Execution of vulnerability tests on IT services exposed on the Internet and, based on the recommendations 
of security by design, on all new services exposed publicly 
 Governance and compliance  
To guide safe behaviour within the organisation and ensure regulatory compliance, the following activities were 
completed: 
• Publication of the updated Organisational Guideline relating to the use of IT tools assigned to employees and 
collaborators 
• Reorganisation of the management process for assessments of the privacy compliance of systems and 
applications 
The Technology Division of the MFE Group in Spain  is in charge of coordinating and managing the technical 
aspects of information system security, following the corporate security policy and the internal action procedures, 
which apply to all employees and managers. 
As part of this policy, and as a method for guaranteeing control over access to corporate applications and services, 
a set of guidelines addressing specific topics such as the "Procedure for controlling access to applications" and 
"Procedure for managing media" has been prepared. The latter procedure defines the cases in which corporate 
data must be encrypted. 
A procedure has also been developed for establishing mechanisms for managing and sending sensitive corporate 
data. A project for implementing an instrument for the management of access and information rights was 
developed in 2018 as a technological support for the procedure. This solution involves the application of security 
rules and policies and the monitoring of the distribution of corporate data. 
During 2021 and 2022, the main procedures relating to information technology were reviewed and updated, with 
particular regard to:  
 Application Access Control Procedure;

The MFE Group in Spain constantly monitors its mission -critical information systems via periodic reviews and 
audits. Monitoring of the systems considered to be most vulnerable also covers the activities of users. 
The purpose of information system security management is to ensure the availability, integrity and confidentiality 
of corporate data, to control access to it, and to ensure the data is adequately protected in conformity with all 
laws, standards and regulations on data protection. 
The MFE Group in Spain has centralised data protection management in the Data Protection Unit, which reports 
directly to the Group's Senior Management and is responsible for data protection for all Group Companies. At the 
head of this unit is the Data Protection Officer, responsible for the relationship with the Data Protection Agency, 
as well as the areas of legal advice, internal control and IT security. 
In 2019, the Personal Data Policy and the relevant internal procedures were updated in order to adapt them to 
the requirements introduced by the GDPR. In addition, two new protocols have been implemented to ensure 
compliance around the protection and guarantee of digital rights. 
These reference documents establish the guidelines for optimal, responsible management of privacy and data 
protection as well as the corrective actions to be taken in the event of violations relating to correct personal data 
processing by the MFE Group. 
During 2023, there were 470 requests to exercise ARCO rights (access, rectification, cancellation and opposition) 
received and managed by the interested parties, relating to the cancellation of users registered on the Group's 
digital channels and the deletion of images published on the websites. 
During 2023 there were no reports of data loss. 
In 2023, in addition to the new Cookie Guide, the local data protection authority (AEPD) published the 10 Principles 
for age verification and protecting minors from inappropriate content. These 10 Principles aim to protect minors 
on the Internet also befor e they access adult content. In this sense, Mediaset España is evaluating the possible 
implementation of these preventive measures on its portals where content suitable only for an adult audience is 
disseminated.

3.5  RELATIONS WITH THE  
PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION 
When carrying out its business - one well-established throughout the entire Italian territory – the MFE Group in 
Italy entertains relationships with a great many private and public parties.  
Precisely in the relations with the aforementioned parties the MFE Group has added an ad hoc article to its Code 
Of Ethics (also see par. 1.3 and 3.2) in order to govern the related activities15.  
In addition to prohibiting any illicit conduct that may involve the Group in its relations with public bodies, the Code 
of Ethics also covers the activities that see the Group involved in partnerships with public institutions. 
In this case, the Group may support programmes of public institutions or bodies aimed at creating public benefit 
as well as projects of foundations and associations. These activities must be performed in full compliance with the 
applicable regulations, the principles set out in the Code of Ethics and the corporate procedures.  
In this area, the MFE Group is proactive through the company R.T.I., which is entitled to participate in European 
projects financed by the European Commission which include collaborations with international partner 
companies. Since 2017, this activity has been governed by ad hoc Organisational Guidelines that govern the 
attainment and management of financial assistance issued by European public institutions to back the 
development of research and innovation projects (for example on the topic of emerging or future technologies, 
saving the environment, etc.). 
  
 
15 Both the Code of Ethics adopted by Mediaset S.p.A. and its Italian subsidiaries in 2019 and the "Code of Ethics" adopted by MFE in 2021 contain a specific provision on relations with institutions, which states 
that "the Mediaset Group maintains a collaborative and transparent relationship with national, EU and international public institutions, in order to facilitate dialogue on issues of specific interest. The relations must be maintained 
fully in compliance with the current regulations, the principles in the Code of Ethics and the corporate procedures, on the basis of the general criteria of propriety, transparency and loyalty”.

November 2016, Medusa Film requests as a priority: 

Page 72:
 
 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 3 ▪ Ethics, Integrity and Transparency in business activities

 Automatic grants for the production and distribution of Italian cinematographic works.  The annual 
quantification of these grants, linked to the economic, cultural and artistic results achieved by individual 
cinematographic works generates a ceiling that must be reinvested over the following five years. To date, the 
Decrees issued by the Director-General of the Ministry of Culture (“MIC”) have quantified the grants accrued 
in the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 (December 2022 Decree).  For the first two years, Medusa has already 
reinvested the ceiling in the production and distribution of new cinematographic works. With respect to the 
grants generated in 2020, the relevant application has been submitted to the MIC, while it is still wait ing to 
be able to submit applications for the years 2021, 2022 and 2023. 
 The tax credit for distribution. For the distribution of films in cinemas and promoting them through 
advertising, the Ministry of Cultural Heritage allows a tax credit to be obtained which is calculated by applying 
variable percentages to the costs incurred. 
The MFE Group in Spain, through its public institutional relations, promotes and guarantees the representation 
of its legitimate interests before public authorities in general, and specifically, before both national and European 
parliaments and governments. 
These activities are governed by the Mediaset España Code of Ethics and aim to guarantee that the legitimate 
interests of Mediaset España are represented before the Spanish Authorities.  
Membership in the main media industry associations such as: 
 Asociación para la autorregulación de la comunicación comercial (AUTOCONTROL) 
 Comité de Autorregulación y Comisión Mixta de Seguimiento sobre contenidos televisivos e infancia 
 Association of Commercial Television in Europe (ACT) 
 Asociación Europea de Comercio de Marketing de Soluciones de Publicidad (EGTA) 
allows the company to defend and represent the common interests of commercial television organisations 
nationally, in Europe and worldwide. 
Thanks to membership of the Audit and Control of Information Systems Association (ISACA), Mediaset España is 
directly involved internationally in the development of standards, methods and certification for the audit and 
control of information systems. 
Throughout the year, the MFE Group in Spain backed the following national and international projects , 
interacting with public bodies and institutions:  
 Participation in the quarterly meeting of the Advertising Market Self-Regulation Committee; 
 Consultation activities with Comisión Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia (CNMC) regarding 
regulations in the field of online advertising and audiovisual communication services through video sharing 
platforms; 
 Application of the General Law on Audiovisual Communication and its regulatory development, with 

Page 73:
 
3 ▪ Ethics, Integrity and Transparency in business activities SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 
 
69 
particular emphasis on strengthening the protection of minors and proper implementation of the provisions 
applicable to TV commercials; 
 Application of a new “system of classification by age range in relation to the use of audiovisual products” 
(signed by free-to-air TV operators in 2015 under the supervision of CNMC)16.  
 This rating system was launched with the aim to establish a more objective and systematic framework for 
classifying content, and as a tool that provides information to guardians, the children themselves and society 
on the whole, on potentially harmful content that a certain audiovisual programme may contain; 
 Application of the rules on gambling and responsible implementation of new online gambling games. 
Mediaset España is on the Board Of Directors of the Responsible Gambling Advisory, formed by the Office for 
the Regulation of Gambling and by the Code of Conduct Monitoring Committee on business communication 
for gambling. 
 Defence of an open and transparent television service directed towards the public interest with control and 
compliance mechanisms, particularly with regard to the advertising market. 
 Participation and consultation in the process of transposing EU Directive 2018/1808 of 14 November 2018 on 
audiovisual media services into national law. 
 Regarding the Digital Service Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA), Mediaset España supports the 
development of both legislative proposals, the aim of which is to promote healthy competition in the digital 
market and update the rules that apply to internet intermediary services, with the ultimate goal of generating 
transparency in the digital advertising market. 
During 2023, Mediaset España closely monitored implementation of the regulations initiated by the Ministry of 
Economy and Digital Transformation for the development of Law 13/2022 of 7 July on General Audiovisual 
Communication, which came into force in 2022.  
Relevant aspects for the television sector regarding commercial communications, the obligation to finance 
European audiovisual works, as well as obligations regarding access to television, were identified for 
implementation. 
 Mediaset España also continued to defend its interests, in the appropriate forums, with respect to the 
European Commission’s regulatory package for the digital single market. 
 A draft proposal for a Regulation on the Freedom of Companies in the Media Sector (“European Media 
Freedom Act”) is of particular importance. This is still at the drafting stage, awaiting final approval following 
the agreement reached between the Council and the European Parliament on 19 December 2023. Mediaset 
España has always supported this proposal in the relevant forums as it aims to protect the pluralism and 
independence of media companies in the EU.

ANTI-CORRUPTION AND UNFAIR COMPETITION 
The topic of active and passive corruption is first and foremost overseen within the scope of the Code of Ethics 
through specific provisions that define the general principles on the topic. 
The current versions of the Code of Ethics (both the one adopted by Mediaset S.p.A. and its Italian subsidiaries in 
2019 and the one adopted in September 2021 by MFE -Mediaforeurope N.V.) have a specific provision that 
deplores and condemns behaviour or act ivity for corrupt ends (including, without limitation, illegitimate 
favouritism, collusion, solicitations – made directly and/or through third parties – for personal benefits of any 
kind for themselves or for others) to achieve individual economic objectiv es. Furthermore, considering the 
constant strengthening of the fight against public and private corruption, both internationally and nationally, in 
view of legislators’ particular focus on combating corruptive practices, as early as 2014 Mediaset S.p.A. an d its 
Italian subsidiaries decided to align themselves with industry best practices to combat corruption, in Italy adopting 
“General Anti -corruption Guidelines ” which are also a substantial and integral component of the Compliance 
Programmes pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/01 of the companies that have them.  
This policy offers a systematic framework of reference on the topic of prohibition of corrupt practices, providing a 
summary of the ethical and conduct rules  that must be strictly adhered to in order to keep illegitimate or 
incorrect conduct from occurring, and to follow the provisions set forth by the current regulations in the area of 
anti-corruption as well as the principles and values in the Code of Ethics, Compliance Programmes pursuant to 
Legislative Decree 231/01 (where adopted) and corporate procedures periodically in effect.  
In this policy, moreover, it is required that any party acting in the name or on behalf of Group companies in 
business relationships with public or private entities must always and in all circumstances behave in an ethical 
manner according to the law and in full compliance with the principles of honesty, fairness and propriety, without 
bringing about corrupt practices of any kind. 
Based on the results of the activities designed to identify risks within Group companies, this policy identifies the 
main areas of remotely relevant activities identified as being “at risk”, in which there is the potential for the 
commission of crimes of public and private corruption.  
This refers to areas (for example management of relations with public bodies and institutions, the purchase of 
goods and services, management of gifts, entertainment expenses, sponsorships and donations, selection and 
hiring of personnel, etc.) in a sphere where it is necessary to pay special attention to issues concerning corporate 
compliance directed towards preventing and fighting corrupt practices. Regarding these areas identified as being 
“at risk ”, each MFE Group company has defined designated control s (general and specific), adopting, when 
necessary, corporate Organisational Guidelines (“ OGs”) which govern the processes in which corrupt practices 
may occur (both in relations with governments and among private parties).  
As already highlighted above, the Internal Auditing Department periodically performs specific auditing activity 
to identify “areas of at-risk activity” with respect to crime, also for corrupt practices and also as instructed by the 
Supervisory and Control Bodies, where appointed by the Italian Group companies in accordance with Legislative 
Decree 231/01. There is also constant monitoring on regulatory c hanges concerning corruption, also with a view 
to updating the Compliance Programmes adopted by the compan ies under Italian law in accordance with 
Legislative Decree 231/01.  

Page 75:
 
3 ▪ Ethics, Integrity and Transparency in business activities SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 
 
71 
Finally, the risk assessment activity carried out in 2023 took into account all new anti-corruption legislation. 
In particular, it should be noted that, based on the results of these activities, with reference to the companies 
under Italian law within the MFE Group, an update of all the Compliance Programmes pursuant to Legislative 
Decree 231/01 is envisaged in the course of 2024. 
Regarding the topic of competition, the Code of Ethics (See also par. 1.3 and 3.2) contains a specific provision 17 
which states that the MFE Group recognises fair, free and honest competition as a decisive factor for market 
growth as well as constant improvement of the business.  
ANTITRUST COMPLIANCE 
We would also highlight the fact that, starting in 2019, Mediaset S.p.A. decided to initiate a process with the aim 
of adopting a specific Antitrust Compliance Programme , understood as a system of rules predominantly 
directed towards preventing potentially significant conduct in terms of antitrust offences. 
This process was completed in 2022 with the adoption of the document containing the “General Antitrust Compliance 
Guidelines”, approved by the Board of Directors of MFE - MEDIAFOREUROPE on 14 February 2023. 
In 2023, the Antitrust Compliance Officer (ACO) put the activities connected with the effective implementation 
of the Programme in place.  
Great attention was paid to implementing a training plan, directed towards disseminating and raising awareness 
of the Programme. 
The training activities were structured as a time for exploring and sharing the Group Compliance Programme in -
depth, and as an examination of the issue of competition in general. 
Lastly, the British company Publieurope has also adopted an “anti -corruption policy” in order to prevent any 
corrupt practices, beyond the Group Code of Ethics, binding for all employees and those who have relations with 
the company. The document is posted on the Publieurope website. The main contracts make explicit reference to 
following both the Code of Ethics of Group and the “Bribery Act” (English law against corruption). The figure of the 
Compliance Officer has also been instated as the individual resp onsible for the corruption prevention system. 
Publieurope also underwent a risk assessment conducted by the Group’s Internal Auditing Department. 
The Code of Ethics, as well as the control procedures implemented and the protocol for the identification and 
prevention of crimes adopted by the Spanish companies of the MFE Group in Spain  establish measures to 
monitor and combat the risk of practices that are corrupt or are harmful to free competition. 
Every year, the audit function performs risk analyses linked to corruption within the most important business lines 
of the Group. These activities are an integral part of the Annual Audit Plan.  
 
17Both in the Code of Ethics adopted by Mediaset S.p.A. and its Italian subsidiaries in 2019 and in the Code of Ethics adopted by MFE-Mediaforeurope N.V. in 2021, there is a specific provision regarding the 
protection of competition.  

Page 76:
 
 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 3 ▪ Ethics, Integrity and Transparency in business activities 
 
72 
The Chairman of the Audit Committee also regularly informs the members of the Board of Directors of the results 
of the audits and the new anti-corruption policies that have been adopted. 
We would also highlight that there are continuous anti-corruption training programmes for employees. 
From 2022, specific anti -corruption clauses have been added to contracts with all third -party production 
companies, with whom Mediaset España is in partnership. 
Also during 2023, no lawsuits were brought against the Group in Spain relating to any monopoly practices 
detrimental to free competition. 
Finally, the Code of Ethics of the MFE Group in Spain , in addition to specific policies , regulate and establish 
control measures to reduce risks related to money laundering. 
 
3.6 TAX COMPLIANCE 
Group companies manage the tax obligations to which they are subject in full compliance with the regulations in 
force in the various tax jurisdictions in which they operate, adhering to principles and values, such as the 
completeness and transparency of information, legitimacy – from a legal and substantial point of view – and the 
clarity and veracity of the data presented, as indicated in the Code of Ethics , in the 231 Compliance 
Programmes, where adopted, and in corporate procedures.  
The determination of taxes due and the preparation of annual tax returns is carried out by a specifically 
identified department of the company  for each of the different tax jurisdictions in the countries where the 
Group companies operate, equipped with adequate competences, according to defined organisational and 
operating procedures, which also makes use, where necessary, of external specialist professionals, to support the 
process of monitoring current legislation, with the aim of identifying any changes in a timely manner and reflecting 
them accurately and completely in the process of determining the taxes due. 
The Group’s tax compliance is first and foremost inspired by respect for the general principles and values indicated 
in the Code of Ethics18 which must guide operations, behaviour and relations, both inside and outside the Group, 
and which must be carried out within a framework of fair competition, in compliance with the laws and regulations 
in force in the legal systems in which Group compani es operate and in accordance with the ethical principles 
commonly recognised in the conduct of business, such as honesty, propriety, transparency and good faith. Group 
companies consequently reject and deplore the use of illegitimate or incorrect behaviour  to achieve their 
economic objectives.  
Consequently, those who act in the name of or on behalf of Group companies in any capacity, whether in business 
relations of interest to them or in relations with the government (including, therefore, the tax authority), 
 
18 The current version of the Code of Ethics adopted by Mediaset S.p.A. and its Italian subsidiaries in 2019 and the Code of Ethics adopted by MFE -MEDIAFOREUROPE N.V. in 2021 are both published in the 
“Compliance” section of the MFE Group corporate website as well as on the company intranet in the specific “Compliance 231” portal. 
 

Page 77:
 
3 ▪ Ethics, Integrity and Transparency in business activities SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 
 
73 
regardless of the competitiveness of the market or the importance of the business conducted, are required to 
behave ethically and in compliance with the laws and regulations in force and to act in accordance with the 
principles of propriety, diligence and cost-effectiveness. 
The extensive structure of internal control systems implemented by the Group, together with the administrative 
and accounting organisational structure, represent important control mechanisms for preventing tax offences 
from being committed. 
With regard to the Internal Control and Risk Management System , the Guidelines defined for the Group, 
which identify the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework as the reference methodology, are 
implemented in the “Enterprise Risk Management Policy”, which defines the main methodological aspects related 
to the gen eral risk management process as well as the roles, responsibilities and main activities related to risk 
management. 
Adequate control mechanisms for administrative-accounting management directed towards guaranteeing truthful 
and accurate representation of the financial position of Group companies and the economic results for the year in 
the financial statements are also found in the MFE Control System for Financial Disclosure, providing for robust, 
traceable and verified processes and controls, which are in themselves a guarantee of the reliability of the 
disclosure and of the data used to prepare tax returns. 
The Italian companies belonging to the Group are currently working, also following the recent introduction of tax 
offences as part of the administrative responsibility of entities pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/01, to strengthen 
its system of preventiv e controls aimed at mitigating tax risk in general, by consolidating its Tax Control 
Framework in order to arrive at a structured model of preventive controls, within the corporate governance 
system, to control all company processes and transactions that m ay give rise to tax consequences, guaranteeing 
an internal control system to manage tax risk which is integrated with the company system and dedicated 
information flows between the various departments responsible for managing internal control.  These figures 
certainly include the Supervisory and Control Bodies pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/01 which, in the 
performance of the tasks and verification activities assigned to them, may use these integrated control 
mechanisms to monitor the actual effectiveness and effective capacity of the 231 Compliance Programmes  – 
where adopted by the Group companies – to prevent tax crimes from being committed, with particular regard to 
the individual corporate structures involved in the management of tax obligations. 
The Group discloses its key tax data annually through submission by the holding company Fininvest S.p.A. of 
information on the payment of taxes applicable to all Group companies, in the various jurisdictions in which it 
operates, (country-by-country reporting) to the Italian Revenue Agency pursuant to Council Directive (EU) 
2016/881 of 25 May 2016, which introduced provisions relating to the mandatory automatic exchange of 
information in the tax sector.

It should be noted that the reported "accrued income taxes" relate only to the current taxes allocated for each 
year. Therefore, the effective tax rate, which can be obtained from the ratio between the "accrued taxes" and 
"pre-tax result" data reported in the table, differs from the ordinary rates in force in the various jurisdictions 

Page 79:

75 
(27.9% in Italy, 25% in Spain) because, in addition to being determined in the presence of non -deductible 
expenses, it does not take into account the components of deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised on 
temporary differences between corporate income and taxable income.  
Furthermore, it should be noted that the taxes accrued and reported for the companies with tax residence in Italy, 
refer, in the two financial years, to IRAP tax (Regional Tax on Productive Activities - at an ordinary rate equal to 
3.9%), which is based, h owever, on a taxable base different from the "pre -tax result", applying only in the 
presence of positive corporate taxable income, and to IRES tax (Corporate Income Tax - at an ordinary rate equal 
to 24%) of the Group companies in the tax consolidation reg ime for the part exceeding the share of income 
deductible from past unlimited reportable tax losses (the latter component is instead accounted for as a reduction 
of deferred tax assets allocated in previous years). The reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the theoretical tax 
rate is shown in the Group's consolidated financial statements in the section on taxes. 
Current taxes include IRAP taxes for the Italian companies and IRES taxes for the Italian companies participating in 
the Group's tax consolidation scheme, following the generation of taxable income during the period (for the 
portion exceeding the portion of income that can be deducted from tax losses carried forward).

Through the Group Code of Ethics, which was updated in 2019, MFE promotes equality, non-discrimination 
and equal opportunities . The MFE Group rejects and excludes any form of exploitation of workers and 
discrimination based on gender, age, race, language, nationality or religion, promoting equal opportunities in 
terms of training, development and professional growth. Finally, the  Group guarantees fair treatment and 
promotes constant dialogue with the social partners.  
In applying the Group's principles, therefore, any conduct or attitude that discriminates against or harms people 
as well as their convictions or preferences is opposed. The promotion of equal opportunities is encouraged with 
reference to work conditions and possibilities, training, development and professional growth, in full compliance 
with current legislation and the values which inspire the Group. Through the appropriate corporate structures, 
compliance with these principles is guaranteed and promoted i n all areas of the organisation, implementing 
management policies aimed at guaranteeing a fair assessment of people already in the selection phase, constantly 
monitoring growth trajectories and designing professional and managerial training courses aimed a t developing 
distinctive behaviours. These initiatives enhance and recognise the wealth deriving from diversity, promote 
integration and are an integral part of the Group's culture. 
Demonstrating the ever -increasing importance that the company attributes to diversity and inclusion issues, in 
2023 the ESG guidelines issued by the Group clearly expressed a goal connected with pay equity, stating the 
company’s intention to maintain the current levels of distribution and pay equity for each category , 
considered positive, through recruitment and professional development policies that promote growth of the less-
represented gender in managerial roles. In particular, in 2023 the goal was state d, also included in the 
management incentive system, to increase the percentage of women in senior management positions to 29%; this 
target was achieved 100%. 
In 2023, the Group also reinforced its commitment to promoting a culture of diversity and inclusion, through 
specific training activities. A mandatory e-learning course was provided to all personnel entitled “D&I: the value of 
diversity and inclusion”, directed towards underscoring the importance of valuing unique qualities in respect for 
people, a central component of the Group’s culture. Courses were also promoted on the GoodHabitz e -learning 
platform, available to all employees, to promote valuing cultural diversity and to provide support in defeating the 
mental mechanisms on which prejudice is founded. Furthermore, for the entire HR department – the staff of which

81 
play a strategic role as ambassadors and facilitators of D&I good practice – a training project was organised on the 
issues of diversity and inclusion, demographic and employment scenarios, generational transition, gender 
equality in organisations and signs of change in organisational cultures.  
The data presented provides a traditional breakdown of employees by the various professional categories, 
including that of "Journalists", typical of the particular business. Around 64% of the Group's employees belong to 
the white collar category, in keeping with the 2022 figures, with a balanced gender distribution.  
As can be seen from the tables above, approx. 40% of Group employees are between 30 and 50 years of age, 
approx. 52% are over 50 years of age, while approx. 8% are below 30 years of age.  
Within the Group, 202 people belonging to protected categories are employed in various corporate roles, with 
an essentially equal distribution between men and women. These represent about 4% of employees. 
 
4.3  PEOPLE MANAGEMENT, ATTRACTION AND 
DEVELOPMENT 
The commitment and motivation of employees are fundamental elements for the Group's success. To this end, 
opportunities for professional growth are continually offered, exploiting the diversity of origin, experience 
and competence.  
Internal company processes are aimed at ensuring a correct assessment of employees starting from both the 
selection phase and that of subsequent professional and managerial development, through constant monitoring 
of growth trajectories and the design of coherent training programmes. 
RECRUITING POLICIES21  
The Group has always enjoyed great visibility on the job market and attractiveness, as demonstrated by more than 
21,000 unsolicited applications received through the Working with Us section of the corporate website22, with 
links to the websites of Group companies. 
In parallel, the use of modern digital recruiting tools and relationships with the leading recruitment companies 
make it possible to actively seek and identify the best profiles on the market in relation to specific needs. 
Finally, the Group's constant and continuous collaboration with the leading Italian and Spanish 
universities makes it possible to contribute to the educational offering of numerous degree and master's courses, 
 
21 Recruitment by the various Group companies, in Italy and abroad, is regulated by specific protocols drawn up in line with the Group's policies, in compliance with the provisions of Legislative Decree 231/01. 
These procedures also take into account the loc al legislation to which Group Companies are subjected, including provisions concerning termination of employment and provisio ns and regulations for specific 
remuneration treatment for "expats" in the event of secondment of personnel abroad. 
22 Figure refers to the Group in Italy

through the many lectures and company testimonies in the classroom by its managers and offering internships in 
the company to young undergraduates and graduates. 
The selection process is in any case always preceded by a careful analysis of qualitative -quantitative 
coherence regarding the size of the workforce, with respect to the organisational needs of the companies and also 
evaluating, where possible, the professional development of internal resources. 
In Italy, more than 800 interviews were carried out during 2023, for both profiles with professional experience 
and internships.  
The selection process is aimed at identifying the most suitable candidates, from the point of view of both technical 
and professional skills as well as soft skills, with the aim of seeking the key skills that the company considers a 
critical success factor for achieving corporate goals.  
In particular, over the years the Group has consolidated a set of key distinctive skills, relating to the cognitive and 
relational-emotional areas, to be sought in the selection processes of figures from the external market and to 
identify and evaluate in planning the development trajectories for internal resources.  
These soft skills in fact represent a critical success factor, common to all areas but differentiated according to the 
role and degree of seniority, for achievement of corporate objectives at both the group and individual growth 
levels and flank the professional skills necessary for the various roles in the organisation. 
The observation and analysis of certain behaviours and attitudes that people tend to adopt during the selection or 
assessment phase allow us to estimate the following significant skills and abilities to be projected in the workplace:  
 Leadership – cultivation of an appropriate style in interpersonal relationships in order to influence and 
involve others in the pursuit of the objectives of the group to which they belong, constituting a role model; 
 Communication – ability to transmit and share ideas and information in a clear and concise manner; 
propensity for listening and effective discussion; 
 Team working – willingness to work and collaborate with others, having the desire to build positive 
relationships aimed at accomplishing the assigned task; 
 Social intelligence – ability to operate in a complex context taking into account one's own attitudes and those 
of others, consciously and objectively reflecting on one's own conduct and that of others; 
 Emotional intelligence - ability to feel emotions, recognise them and experience them consciously, thus being 
able to be fully assertive and expressive in interpersonal relationships; 
 Reliability – ability to carry out tasks scrupulously and with attention to content; 
 Flexibility – ability to know how to adapt to changing working contexts, openness to innovation and 
willingness to collaborate with people with different points of view from one's own. Adaptation to different 
situations and changes in context, showing inte rest in discussing ideas different from one's own and 
willingness to reorganise one's thinking on the basis of new information; 

Page 87:
 
4 ▪ People SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 
 
83 
 Stress resistance / emotional stability - ability to react positively to work pressure while maintaining control, 
remaining focused on priorities and not transferring one's tensions to others. Ability to overcome defeats and 
failures; attention to the way in which one's emotions are managed and impulses controlled in difficult 
situations; 
 Self-confidence - awareness of one's value, of one's abilities and of one's ideas irrespective of the opinions of 
others; 
 Problem solving – ability to devise alternative solutions to a problem, estimating the implications for the 
expected results. This is the tendency to provide concrete solutions that optimise activities in response to the 
constraints present; 
 Life-long learning – recognition of one's deficiencies and areas of improvement, taking action to acquire and 
further improve knowledge and skills. 
 
In order to guarantee new recruits an effective start-up of their work activity, the departments involved supervise 
all phases in the resource’s induction, from activation of the welcome and induction plan  to tutoring and 
coaching. In particular, in the last year the onboarding strategy has been reinforced, with the aim of making 
newcomers feel an integral part of corporate reality. Thanks to the onboarding process, newcomers can get to 
know and adapt to the new environment in a short time, understand the v alues and history of the company and 
accelerate acquiring a basic knowledge of their new workplace. To do this, the figure of the buddy was introduced. 
Alongside their supervisor and the team of the new recruit, they accompany newcomers through their induction. 
Meetings dedicated to all new recruits have also been scheduled, which provides basic information on the 
organisation and operation of the company and encourages knowledge and development of cross -operational 
connections between new employees. This  is accompanied by two days of ad hoc training dedicated to the 
development of personal skills.  
In 2023, 178 people were recruited with open -ended contracts in the MFE Group in Italy, an increase compared 
to the previous year. New staff were recruited particularly in the Technology and Operations area, where there is 
a significant generational transition and there is an ever more frequent need to recruit people with specific skills 
related to the implementation of new technologies, as well as in the commercial area. 
49% of those recruited in the year are aged between 30 and 50 and 44% are less than 30 years old.  
There was also the opportunity for 255 young people to have an internship experience in Italy lasting around 5 
months on average. 
In 2023, there was a recruitment rate of approx. 6% in Italy and approx. 11% in Spain, where 110 people were 
recruited below 30 years of age.

NOTE: To provide a more meaningful representation of the turnover rate for the MFE Group, the calculation method includes in the numerator only the employees with open-ended contracts by gender and age group. The recruitment and turnover rates are calculated by comparing the total of open-ended contracts for recruitment 
and leaving in the year by age group and gender with the average value of the number of employees for the same age groups. Recruitment and leaving produced by variations in boundary due to acquisitions and terminations in the reporting period are excluded from the calculation.

REMUNERATION POLICIES 
In the MFE Group, the remuneration levels of employees are determined through an assessment carried out by 
the Human Resources Department and by the Business Managers who, with the aim of ensuring the 
competitiveness of internal remuneration levels with respect to market benchmarks, take into account the area of 
responsibility, the task performed and the principles of internal equity irrespective of the sex of employees, as 
well as the need to maintain a level of attractiveness and retention for key resourc es. To this end, depending on 
the role, all modern remuneration instruments can be adopted to supplement fixed remuneration, such 
as: non -competition agreements, short and long -term variable incentives, as well as the welfare and benefit 
system that Group employees enjoy. 23 To support the assessment of equity and the competitiveness of 
remuneration packages, the Group uses remuneration survey and benchmark tools  provided by leading 
specialist consultancy companies. 
With respect to remuneration criteria for senior management bodies, please refer to the compensation report 
included in the MFE Group Consolidated Financial Statements as at 31 December 2023. 
With reference to the requirements of the GRI standards, the ratio of annual total compensation for the person 
receiving the highest compensation to the median total compensation for all Group employees (excluding the 
aforementioned person24) for the 2023 financial year is 56:1. 
With regard to the ratio25 between the percentage increase in the total annual salary of the person receiving the 
maximum salary and the median percentage increase in the total annual salary of all employees (excluding the 
aforementioned person), for the year 2023 it is approximately 2 times. 
TRAINING 
The Group is constantly committed to designing effective managerial and professional training activities and 
training on sustainability issues, in addition to those related to legal compliance, in order to develop and 
increase the skills and personal capacities of its employees, considered a critical success factor to support the 
development of its businesses. During 2023, each area of training activity was monitored, taking care to provide 
courses that served the needs of personnel.  
The definition of training projects occurs in coherence with the need to develop professional skills and managerial 
competences, in line with the business context and new compliance programmes, the need to align skills related 
to the technological evolution processes, and also the ESG goals defined by the MFE Group. 
In addition to reading and interpreting the main development trends and scenarios of the Group that can provide 
a basis for designing training, monitoring of training needs  is performed with the involvement of the 
Organisation and Development department, which interprets specific growth needs with respect to the personal 
 
23 In particular, the remuneration policy applied to the Group's top management is detailed in the 2023 Remuneration Report. 
24 For the calculation of the indicator, the Total Annual Remuneration (RTA) was used. The value of the median is the same as would be obtained by including in addition also the value of the long-term system, 
not included in the RTA. The short-term system is included in target (100%, without short-term destination). 
25 In 2023 both the total annual salary of the highest paid person in the organisation and the median salary excluding the highe st paid have increased. For this reason, it was possible to calculate requirement 
b of the GRI 2-21 disclosure. Specifically for this letter b, the MFE Group calculated the percentage increases in the salary of the highest  paid, of the median excluding the highest paid and calculated the ratio 
between the two.

89 
skills of cross-operational personnel within the Group, and of the Human Resource Management department. At 
the same time, monitoring the evolution of legislation makes it possible to effectively ensure the provision of 
training envisaged by the legal framework. 
The training offering is provided in various ways, such as in -person courses, conferences, workshop activities, 
online courses and webinars selected according to the specific objectives and content of the initiative and the 
specific requirements of the recipients in order to maximise the effectiveness and efficiency of the teaching activity.  
During 2023, the trend of a spread in digital training methods continued, both with courses held in remote 
classrooms or webinars and with the use of online training objects that each employee can choose to attend 
through the Training Portal. Here, each employee can freely access two e-learning platforms that contain a variety 
of courses and content. This training opportunity is constantly supported by communication and engagement 
activity on the company Intranet.  
On some occasions, specific online courses have been assigned to groups of people who have attended classroom 
courses, in order to broaden or complete the content covered. The adoption of digital training tools allows both 
an expansion in the training cont ent and enhanced digital skills for all employees, who can experience of a new 
training option that’s enjoyable and involves self -learning. This development is in line with the processes of 
digitalisation that the Group is managing, as well as coherent and  integrated with the Smart Working model 
adopted. 
Overall, the actions taken have led to significant training results, since people were involved and followed in 
activities that met with a high degree of participation and satisfaction.  
The most significant initiatives carried out during 2023 in Italy are described below.  
Management training during the year was designed around the needs of different groups of personnel, taking 
into account the specific characteristics of the corporate context, understood both as a social community and as a 
union of different professional identities, and the transformation of internal processes.  
In particular, during the year the desire to work across all areas of the Group emerged through two specific 
projects: one aimed at new hires and one aimed at senior managers.  
All the people who joined the company within a year were involved in a course called “InMediaset”, which had 
the goal of strengthening some specific important personal skills, especially in the stages of coming into contact 
with a new work environment, to identify motivational levers and professional goals with optimal management 
of organisational logic. Topics such as social intelligence and self-awareness were discussed, among others, from 
the perspective of influencing and encouraging proactivity in respect for the culture and founding values of the 
Group.  
An initiative entitled “Stories of Innovation” was provided to all senior management personnel, in the belief that, 
since the Group’s history is founded on innovative and creative capabilities, this imprinting must be cultivated 
constantly. The design focu s of the initiative was an innovative attitude as a fundamental element of the 
managerial mindset, to develop in order to design and lead company processes.  
During three occasions for meeting and discussion with witnesses within and outside of the Group, experiences 
and knowledge were shared that encouraged facing the new challenges of technological innovation with courage

90 
and determination and maintaining an open-minded attitude in planning and managing corporate processes of 
change. 
With regard to well-being and attention to people, in 2023 a remote listening and psychological support service 
was again launched for all employees. The service is managed in collaboration with an outside company which 
allows employees to speak with a certified psychologist by phone or video, while guaranteeing personal anonymity 
and confidentiality. Employees can therefore make use of the service at any time they feel the need, to face private 
or professional situations and circumstances.  
In continuity with previous years, the development project focused on identifying key managerial competencies 
continued, through one-on-one coaching sessions for a selected number of managers. 
In relation to vocational activities, activities were carried out to increase technical skills and trade -specific 
knowledge. Activities in this area have often been dictated by technological upgrade requirements, in particular 
for the technical and production areas, where technology acts as a factor that enables innovation in compan y 
processes and individual skills. 
 As in previous years, projects of a technical nature ran for resources in the Operations Area, aiming in particular 
at learning the functional skills for using new technologies typical of studio equipment in TV production. 
In line with an important technological innovation to support internal processes in managing contracts in the 
broadcasting sector, an extensive training activity was carried out to allow people to understand and best use a 
new-generation application used in various company areas that requires people to have an advanced approach 
to the digital tool.  
In the sales house area, the “One Vision” project to increase and align knowledge of advertising products 
continued from the previous year. This activity involved both new hires and senior staff, in a shared path of 
exploring the characteristics of the broad advertising offering in the various media (TV, print, radio, digital...) that 
sales houses offer on the advertising investor market. The knowledge required of those who work in the 
commercial field is increasingly broad and diversified, as well as constantly evolving, and must be kept up to date. 
The programme was built drawing on the expertise of professionals within the company who took on a teaching 
role in a genuine relationship of accompanying the learning of their colleagues. The project was organi sed using 
different teaching methods, from in -person classrooms to the provision of digital content, such as videos and 
presentations, and learning tests. 
Other professional projects were dedicated to specific topics, including the Project Management course for people 
who need to organise their activity from the perspective of projects, knowledge upgrade courses for using graphics 
and editing systems and a b road programme directed towards increasing awareness and knowledge of data 
security, run by internal teachers and aimed at figures involved in technology processes. An initial project was also 
carried out for a defined target audience with the goal of know ledge about certain generative AI tools, which are 
being observed and used for the first time in the world of work and therefore have to be known and assessed in 
terms of their potential both now and in the future. 
Courses were delivered as usual to keep personnel up to date and informed on specialist content for individual 
areas, with attention to those that require constant updating to external situations or legislation. Courses directed

towards in -depth study of Office tools are also always available (managed exclusively through digital self -
learning).  
Finally, language training continued with dedicated individual courses for those who need to enhance their 
knowledge of a foreign language, through a platform that offers the possibility of remote video lessons with 
teachers who are native speakers.  
2023 saw the continuation and consolidation of ESG training activities. There was work on projects with content 
dedicated to topics principally in the Environment and Social areas, with education and awareness-raising content 
related to the ESG Guidelines adopted by the Group. Sustainability was identified as a key topic on which to 
provide knowledge, refine sensitivity and raise awareness around issues that involve and affect people and the 
company at the same time.  
In this area, an e-learning course entitled “D&I: the value of diversity and inclusion” was provided to all personnel, 
with content directed towards valuing diversity and considering the importance of inclusion, elements considered 
central in the culture o f the Mediaset Group, consistent with the Sustainability Guidelines approved by the MFE 
Board of Directors.  
In terms of the Environment, a webinar was offered entitled “The impacts of climate change on water and habitat”, 
with the aim of informing and raising awareness of ongoing climate change phenomena and their consequences, 
focusing on the natural habitat and the risk of drought, but also of evaluating the possible solutions to launch to 
deal with this pressing problem.  
In the Social area, a specific project on D&I issues was organised for the entire HR department, the staff of which 
cover a strategic role as ambassadors and facilitators of D&I good practice by directing policies that aim to 
identify, integrate and value the diversity present in the company, as well as attracting talent on the labour 
market. The project focused on transmitting knowledge sharing reflections on D&I issues, demographic and 
employment scenarios, generational transition, gender equality in organisations and signs of change in 
organisational cultures. 
Training activities related to ESG topics were supported by constant communication activity on the company 
Intranet, in order to encourage employee participation by expressing the company’s strong commitment to 
spreading the culture of Sustainability. To strengthen this commitment, a specific target relating to the number of 
hours of ESG training provided to employees has also been established in 2023 within the short -term incentive 
system for top management and some other managers. The company has committed to providing a total of 3,300 
hours of Sustainability training in 2023, fully achieving the target by providing 6,352 hours. 
With regard to statutory compliance, initiatives envisaged by legislation were carried out, paying attention to 
the specific issues of the company.  
In particular, Health and Safety training was delivered for new recruits and people with roles envisaged by the 
Group’s Safety Management System. The Workers’ Refresher project continued both in the classroom 
(Fundamentals of First Aid programme) and with the provision of a two -hour online course. In line with the 
provisions of Legislative Decree 81, courses have been activated in relation to requirements for the internal figures 
of the Group Safety Management System. All activities are based on the intenti on to make people aware of the

 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 4 ▪ People 
 
92 
value of the culture of Safety and Health in the workplace that the Group pursues. 
With respect to Privacy, a new course entitled “Privacy: from general principles to the compliance programme” 
was designed internally and delivered to all personnel. The course, lasting approximately one hour, reviewed the 
principles of the GDPR and the Group’s compliance programme, providing the fundamental knowledge for correct 
personal data processing. 
On issues related to regulatory compliance, and in particular on the subject of training and information on the 
Organisation, Management and Control Model established pursuant to Legislative Decree 231, Privacy and 
Security, specific training, usually thro ugh an online method, is provided upon recruitment of personnel. New 
recruits are also informed on how to consult the Code of Ethics of the Group and the compliance programme. 
Finally, all employees can access this documentation at any time on the company intranet. 
With regard to trade union relations, within the context of an approach of discussion with workers' 
representatives, a Bilateral Training Committee (consisting of company and trade union representatives) has been 
established for many years with the task of:  
 contributing to monitoring training requirements related to the need to maintain levels of professionalism 
appropriate to the production evolution of the company; 
 formulating indications on projects and means of professional updating of human resources, with particular 
reference to initiatives in the field of life -long training, in relation to increasingly rapid technological 
developments and to issues concerning health and safety in the workplace; 
 promoting, analysing and signing annual and periodic training projects/plans to be submitted to the inter -
professional funds within the scope of funded training; 
 carrying out periodic qualitative and quantitative analyses of the training activity carried out.  
In 2023 too, structural use has been made of resources from Fondi Paritetici Interprofessionali (Inter-professional 
Joint Funds): Fondimpresa for the training of middle managers and employees, and Fondirigenti for executives, to 
fund a considerable portion of the Group’s training activities.

NB: any percentages above 100% are caused by fluctuations between the number of employees who received training during the ye ar (including any terminated employees) and the average number of 
employees for the reference category. 
In 2023, training on issues related to human rights involved, throughout the MFE Group, 1,620 people and 2,161 
hours of training were delivered. 
For 2023 overall, the Group provided 48,820 hours of training in Italy, an increase of 36% compared to 2022. 
People training and talent management are critical elements for the corporate strategy of the MFE Group in 
Spain since they allow a rapid adaptation to the dynamic needs of the environment in which it operates.  
More than around 11,000 hours of training were provided in the course of 2023. Among the main initiatives were 
training courses on accidents and risk prevention with respect to health and safety, compliance, training courses 
on leadership development progr ammes, coaching for senior managers and managerial development courses 
dedicated exclusively to female personnel. Of particular note in the course of 2023 were foreign language courses 
(3,052 hours), digital training courses (1,802 hours) and induction courses (2,934 hours). 
Given the strategic role of innovation, the training plan dedicates many training hours to IT courses and the use of 
new software. In continuity with previous years, the MFE Group in Spain also offers occupational risk prevention 
courses (1,005 hours).  
As indicated in detail previously, the most relevant training areas during 2023 were those linked to the 
development of skills in language training, digital skills and induction. 
A cybersecurity training campaign for the entire company also began in 2023 which will extend into 2024. 
Ultimately, more than 70% of the MFE workforce in Spain received some type of training in 2023. 
We would also mention the scholarship programme for Group employees, as part of the Master’s in Audiovisual 
Content Creation and Management. Not only does this course of study provide multidisciplinary knowledge of the 
Group’s activity with the assistance of an expert teaching staff, but it helps students acquire and develop key skills 
and abilities for professional development in the audiovisual sector.

The 13th edition of the Master’s in Audiovisual Content Creation and Management at the European University of 
Madrid, inaugurated in November 2022 and developed in 2023, saw the participation of 24 students.  
During 2023, 4 students from the Master’s were hired. 
The collaboration agreements with public and private universities and business schools should not be forgotten, 
in order to promote internships in the company for students. This activity guarantees the creation of a future 
reservoir of new professionals that the company will be able to access in the future to meet its needs in terms of 
new human resources. 
During 2023, 260 students from universities and professional training institutes took part in these company 
internships. 
53 were then hired through Temporary Employment Agencies (ETT). 
Added to all this is the “Showrunner: Fiction Classroom” programme, launched in October 2019 and held jointly 
by Mediaset España and the Cinema and Audiovisual School of Catalonia (ESAC). 
In this programme, professionals operating in the film and television sector train students through a pathway 
allowing them to acquire the experience and knowledge needed to become experts in the production of drama 
content.  
In 2023, the “Sumas Talento” scholarship programme for the Diploma in Drama and Audiovisual Creation at the 
Madrid Audiovisual Drama School (MADS) was continued, through which scholarships were awarded by the 
Mediaset España (5 scholarships for students who were part of the programme).

4.4  WELFARE AND WELL-BEING 
All MFE Group companies have defined various corporate welfare systems in line with the policies on human 
resources that have always put people at the centre of the corporate system.  
In 2023 this central importance was reinforced through a statement in the Sustainability guidelines adopted by 
MFE’s Board of Directors of a specific commitment to recognising and appreciating the value, experience and 
professionalism of the company’s human resources, valuing the differences and characteristics of each individual, 
creating a positive and future-oriented environment. In terms of welfare, the Group has therefore made a further 
commitment to maintaining the high standards of excellence achieve d, both in terms of the level of investment 
and the variety and innovation of the service offering, paying particular attention to employee satisfaction and 
their personal and professional growth so that they demonstrate their individual potential at all s tages of their 
careers. 
For over ten years the Mediacenter has been active at the Milan and Rome offices, the result of an important 
project aimed at creating an optimal context to facilitate the best balance between professional and personal life. 
In particular, this is an area on company premises that includes a series of useful and concrete services for 
improving the quality of life of those working for the Group. 
With an area of 3,000 square metres, Mediacenter is considered one of the most useful and welcoming welfare 
stores in Italy. The services offered, managed by external operators selected for their specific experience in the 
areas of reference, concern personal care and activities necessary for family management: medical centre, which 
provides the medical services of specialists from the San Raffaele Hospital to employees free of charge; 
 fitness centre; 
 mini market; 
 laundry/tailoring repair services; 
 bank; 
 post office; 
 bookshop; 
 parapharmacy; 
 shopping area; 
 catering (bar, sandwich bar and restaurant). 
 
There are also many deals negotiated by the company for its staff – with banks, insurance companies and over a 
hundred retailers active online or near the Group’s main offices. In particular, various “ESG” conventions have 
been signed in the last year, directed towards supporting sustainable development because they make it possible 
to promote and pay attention to issues such as environmental protection, social impact, well -being and waste 
reduction. 
The renewal of the supplementary company agreement for the television area, signed at the end of 2023, 
envisages the introduction of a welfare platform which will allow access to flexible benefits and will expand the 
wide range of services already made available to employees, further strengthening corporate welfare.

The Group has also been working for many years, together with local public bodies, to offer its employees 
transport and mobility services through company shuttle buses that connect the Group's offices throughout 
the day (including public holidays for production centres) to the main nearby underground and/or railway 
stations. The service is the result of a detailed analysis of the home and w ork journeys of all Group personnel of 
the Milan and Rome offices, implemented in collaboration with the Department of Architecture and Planning 
(DIAP) of the Politecnico di Milano, aimed at optimising transport service routes and times and limiting personal 
inconvenience connected with reaching the workplace, both in terms of time optimisation and stress 
accumulation. The Group has put in place agreements with public and private entities for the use of parking spaces 
during working hours and has stipulated framework agreements with local public transport for discounted season 
tickets for employees with debit to the payroll.  
In 2012, a company Campus was also set up at the Cologno site with specific architectural features aiming to 
connect all the buildings and production sites of the Group’s headquarters with a more functional approach with 
respect to the use of work spaces and integration of company  areas, achieved through an agreement with the 
Municipality of Cologno Monzese, which transferred Via Cinelandia to the Group in exchange for redevelopment 
of Viale Europa, which the MFE headquarters overlook.

The Group safeguards maternity and return to work after the birth of children thanks to an important corporate 
initiative, the Nursery, which since 2004 can accommodate the children of employees up to 3 years of age; this 
solution allows parents to entrust their children to specialised educators, at the workplace, during working hours, 
avoiding the need for employees to sacrifice time and money on the care and custody of their children during the 
daytime. 
In 2022, a major project of rethinking workplaces was launched, partly as a result of the changes introduced by 
the new post -pandemic smart working model, which led the Group to ask how it could review the offices and 
make them more functional, generating value for employees on days when they are on site. The main goals of the 
project were:  
 to create opportunities for collaboration and exchanging ideas, fundamental for stimulating innovation; 
 to guarantee the social dimension, made more complex by the hybrid working model; 
 to reinforce the sense of belonging and demonstrate the concept of an innovative, welcoming company; 
 to best support remote working between people who collaborate despite different locations.

The initiative was undertaken with the support of an architectural firm specialised in designing newly conceived 
work environments which started from these goals to produce a concept for implementing a pilot project, through 
interviews, workshops and focus groups. The pilot  was effected with the complete renovation of the first three 
floors of the Viale Europa 46 building. 
In 2023, in continuity with the previous year, MFE took part in the WHP (Workplace Health Promotion) 
programme, promoted by the Lombardy Region, allowing the Group to obtain the European workplace health 
promotion (ENWHP) certificate thanks to all the projects listed above and new initiatives promoted during the 
year, such as the “Mediaset ha a cuore il futuro” ca mpaigns for breast cancer prevention, mental health and 
protecting women who are victims of violence, as well as initiatives that aim to promote e mployee well-being, 
including the launch of a remote listening and psychological support service, which all employees can access freely 
and anonymously. Furthermore, as part of WHP Programme activities, a questionnaire was presented to 
employees for evaluating widespread awareness around food waste, sharing its results and then offering thinking 
points that help increase awareness of the relationship between food waste and sustainability. 
In 2023, collaboration also began with AVIS, which made mobile blood donation units available for a day in its 
Milan and Rome offices. Many employees took part, demonstrating a great spirit of solidarity and care for others. 
Running the initiative on compa ny premises enabled raised awareness of blood donation, promoting effective 
participation in this generous activity. 
The company intranet is an effective information and sharing tool that contains and circulates all the company 
regulations, organisational procedures, services for employees and Mediacenter news and publishes many news 
items to communicate the activities in progress in the various business areas and update its staff on the Group’s 
initiatives in the area of sustainability, social campaigns, broadcasting projects, production and technological 
innovations, training activities, broadcasting rights acquisition,  radio events, new partnerships and much more. 
The intranet is also the tool through which links to many company applications and the services of the human 
resources portal (salary statements, personal documents, attendance management, contracts and forms)  are 
made available and through which the circulation of surveys to determine employees’ opinions or experiences of 
certain specific issues is reinforced. 
BENEFITS 
The benefits envisaged for MFE Group workers in Italy are mainly of a social security and welfare nature. For all 
employees there is a supplementary health care plan, 24 -hour accident insurance policy and the supplementary 
pension fund. The company also guarantees integration of the statutory remuneration provided for maternity for 
all its employees. For senior managers, in addition to these benefits, life and permanent disability insurance due 
to illness, as well as company cars depending on the role held, are also envisaged.  
In addition to the annual review of its employees’ remuneration, Publieurope provides health and welfare 
benefits. 
The MFE Group in Spain looks after its employees by guaranteeing a wide range of benefits aimed at facilitating 
a better balance between work and private life. These benefits range from the possibility of using a company 
shuttle or free parking at the workplace to the company canteen, which benefits all workers, health insurance for 

Page 103:
 
4 ▪ People SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 
 
99 
spouses and children (up to 25 years), mandatory and/or optional medical check -ups and supplementary 
insurance for absence due to caring for children or relatives. 
WORKING HOURS 
The Group has always identified and implemented specific tools that facilitate the reconciliation of time dedicated 
to private and professional life, facilitating the equilibrium between demand and supply of flexibility in the 
workplace, in line with the needs and opportunities that characterise the television business. 
With this in mind, a variety of working hours has been contractually defined with the trade unions which flexibly 
meets the needs of both the company and its workers. Specifically and for most employees, with various specific 
exceptions for the operational  needs of the various organisational structures, it is possible to clock in flexibly 
between 9.00 and 10.30 am. The remaining workers, engaged in production activity, benefit from a 7 -hour work 
day, rather than 8.  
Moreover, from an operational point of view, reductions in working hours are generally granted to personnel 
requesting this in all the areas of the company, in the presence of the technical and organisational conditions and 
where the job permits; to date, 249 people in the entire MFE Group benefit from a part-time contract. 
Starting in 2019, the Group launched the Smart Working  project, which, having begun with pilot phases, 
accelerated greatly in the initial months of the pandemic emergency. Following the requirement of general 
application during the emergency period, the MFE Group assessed it and determined that it could const itute a 
new structural method of working, representing an element that enables increased productivity, digital 
development, the promotion of professionalism and goal -oriented work, the promotion of soci al, economic and 
environmental sustainability as well as a tool for balancing the production and organisational needs of the 
company and work -life balance for workers. In light of this, the Group has defined a new approach to the 
organisation of work characterised by synergy between flexibility, autonomy, responsibility and collaboration. To 
this end, the MFE Group signed an experimental agreement with trade unions in May 2021, definitively confirmed 
in December 2022, directed towards regulating the principles on which the new organisational method of working 
is based. 
The New Smart Working Model adopted by the Group provides for a combination of work carried out remotely 
and activities carried out on the appropriate company premises according to “at least 1” logic: work can be carried 
out at least one day a week remotely and at least one day a week on site, through a weekly schedule defined within 
the individual structures, which takes into account both the technical, organisational and production needs of the 
company and the personal needs of the workers concerned.

4.5  INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS 
The MFE Group has established and built a consolidated and effective system of industrial and trade union 
relations at all levels of representation. 
The topics typically subject to discussion and disclosure consist of work organisation in terms of jobs, levels and 
processes, the operating performance of the company, the evolution of the workforce and training issues, as well 
as the evolution of the business. 
The companies in the MFE Group apply the relevant National Collective Agreements or Supplementary 
Company Agreements (AIA) to all of their employees, regulating all the typical situations of the employment 
relationship. In particular, for Italian companies, the following are applied: for Senior Managers, the National 
Collective Bargaining Agreement for Commercial Senior Managers and for Industrial Senior Managers; for Middle 
Managers and White -Collar Workers, the National Collective Bargaining Agreement for Private Radio and 
Television Companies, for Commercial Service Industries and for Engineering Workers; and for Journalist s, the 
FNSI National Collective Journalists Bargaining Agreement. In addition, a Supplementary Company Agreement 
applied to Middle Managers and White -Collar Workers and a Supplementary Company Agreement applied to 
Journalist staff that regulate and improve  on the conditions provided for by the national agreements have been 
historically in force for the television area of the Group. 
Specific provisions that further regulate and detail working conditions, working hours and ad hoc technical -
production models for individual companies are usually managed via agreements with the trade union 
representatives of the workers concerned. 
The Group manages any structural changes to the organisational, production and logistics structure that have a 
material impact on the employment relationship with employees by following the union discussion procedures 
governed by current legislation, national collective agreements and company agreements. These activities aim to 
guarantee fruitful negotiation that limits the impact on workers and, where possible, improves any contractual 
provisions. 
At the end of a discussion between the Company and the Trade Unions in the radio and television sector, the trade 
union negotiations for the Renewal of the Group’s Supplementary Company Agreement, in force until the 
end of 2025, concluded on 12 December 2023, defining important measures to benefit employees.  The new 
agreement will also be extended to the radio sector, which will therefore be able to benefit from the improved 
conditions provided for by the second level agreement.  
As part of the renewal, particular attention was paid to Welfare issues, an area that was expanded through the 
creation of new tools and reinforcement of existing ones. In particular, the welfare platform was introduced, 
allowing the amounts relating to the Performance Bonus to be converted into flexible benefits and the use of any 
donations from the company, guaranteeing employees access to further welfare goods and services. The Smart 
Working model adopted by the Company was also established, providing fo r a combination of work carried out 
remotely and activities carried out on the appropriate company premises according to existing logic of the “at least 

Page 105:
 
4 ▪ People SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 
 
101 
1” model. With a view to work -life balance, greater flexibility in starting was also shared with staff with constant 
working hours. 
With reference to remuneration, in order to facilitate participation in the supplementary pension scheme, the 
amount that the company contributes to the fund has been increased. The amount of the Performance Bonus has 
also been increased for all employees, paid not only according to ec onomic-financial indicators but also to non -
financial objectives, related to: the reduction of CO2 emissions, the average daily share, use of holiday and hours 
of ESG training. Improvements to remuneration have also been arran ged for middle management, for whom an 
increase in the occupational allowance has been established, and for staff with technical -productive shift work, 
for which the working conditions on joining the company have been improved. 
On the subject of procurement, reinforcement of the supervisory and control procedures was promoted with 
respect to the compliance of suppliers with the collective agreements signed by the most representative trade 
unions, also through the creation of a procurement commission.  
With respect to the labour market, collective bargaining has made the Professional Skills Commission  that was 
already present in the previous Supplementary Agreement permanent. At the same time, the same Commission, 
driven by the continuous change of processes and the adaptation of production and work organisation to the 
innovative use of advanced techno logies, has begun a process of reviewing and adapting the personnel 
classification system. 
The 2021-2023 renewal of the supplementary company agreement for the MFE Group in Spain was signed in 
2021. This agreement improves on some of the regulatory conditions and governs aspects related to planning 
production requirements, internal mobility and notice periods. 
Below are the collective agreements envisaged for the MFE Group in Spain: 
 Mediaset España Collective Agreement (this was renewed in 2021, valid until 2023); 
 Collective Agreement of the Advertising sector for employees of Publiespaña and Be a Lion; 
 Collective agreement for Supersport “Audiovisual Producers” employees; 
 Madrid Regional Collective Agreement for Conecta 5, Mediterráneo, Telecinco Cinema and Megamedia 
employees; 
 Collective agreement for EL Desmarque journalists.

4.6  HEALTH AND SAFETY OF WORKERS 
The MFE Group in Italy and Spain26 has adopted, implemented and effectively deployed an Occupational Health 
and Safety Management System (OHSMS), compliant with the OHSAS 18001:2007 standard. After UNI ISO 
45001:2018 came into force, the MFE Group updated its Occupational Health and Safety Management System to 
the new standard, obtaining Certification at Corporate level. 
The certification of an OHSMS represents the recognition, by an accredited body, that: 
 the management of health and safety issues in the workplace complies with the applicable provisions, 
regulations, etc; 
 these issues are regulated, as well as adequately and continuously monitored, in order to reduce their impact 
on workers and pursue the prevention of occupational accidents and diseases, with a view to continuous 
improvement. 
The Certification is valid in Italy for Corporate and for all the 13 companies that have adopted this management 
model, including27: Mediaset S.p.A., R.T.I. S.p.A., Elettronica Industriale S.p.A., Medusa Film S.p.A., Publitalia'80 
S.p.A., Digitalia'08 S.r.l., R2, Radiomediaset S.p.A., Radio Studio 105 S.p.A, Virgin Radio Italy S.p.A., Monradio S.r.l., 
RMC Italia S.p.A and Radio Subasio S.r.l.  
The application of the OHSMS concerns all workers operating in all offices of the above companies and their 
activity as well as management of contracted work. 
The UNI ISO 45001 OHS Management System was subjected to a certification audit by a certification body. The 
audit was successful and the 45001 certification was issued at the corporate and individual company level. 
The System envisages the development and adoption of specific types of documents including: Policies, General 
Procedures, Operating Procedures, Operating Instructions and Practical Solutions. Among these there are, of 
course, some specific ones aimed at identifying and preventing risks and training programmes on health and safety 
issues28 (which are defined according to the assessment of the risks to which workers are exposed in the course 
of their work). 
Furthermore, for the purposes of the systems and rules for recording and reporting of statistics, the MFE Group 
has recourse to specific supporting IT tools, such as the Simpledo.Net platform. 
At least once a year, in compliance with the provisions of art. 35 of Legislative Decree 81/08, for each certified 
company of the Group, a “Meeting” is convened which constitutes the “Management Review” referred to in 
paragraph 9.3 of UNI ISO 45001:2018. 
 
26 The occupational health and safety management system for the Mediaset Group in Spain does not cover employees in foreign offices. The foreign companies MedSet and Publieurope do not come under the 
Mediaset OHSMS either, but refer to local legislation. 
27 The Taodue company adopts a version similar to the Mediaset OHSMS and employs an external OH&S service.  
28 The PG SIC procedure 05 "Information, education and training of workers in health and safety in the workplace" governs the pr ocess of informing, educating and training personnel on health and safety in 
the workplace.

The Workers' Health & Safety Representatives (WSR) represent all workers. 
In the case of critical events that may involve employees during business trips abroad, the "Personnel Abroad 
Security Committee" has been established, consisting of: 
 Central Personnel and Organisation Director 
 Safety Director 
 Personnel Director 
 Company representative of the area to which the employee concerned belongs. 
In order to guarantee safe working conditions, in May 2013 the MFE Group set up an "Operational Guideline" 
in order to guarantee the safety of its personnel on business trips in countries or areas considered "at risk".  
Lastly, the Risk Management Department provides adequate insurance coverage for business trips abroad. 
It should be noted that no Group workers are involved in activities with a high accident or health risk29. 
There are also specific clauses that cover health and safety issues in contracts30 in which the parties agree that the 
protection of health and the physical integrity of workers is a primary and constant concern for companies; also, 
with regard to the occupational safety and health of workers, express reference is made to the provisions  of 
Legislative Decree 81/2008, as amended and supplemented.31 
 
29 On 30 November 2018 (published on 5/12/2018) two Organisational Guidelines - O.G. MD/HO 105 and 106 -were issued, defining the organisational and operating models adopted by the Mediaset Group 
to manage any crisis situations (CRISIS Management Compliance Programme), in order to reduce negative impact on the business, limit damage to property and harm to persons and take advanta ge of any 
opportunities for the Group, contributing to improving company resilience and its value in time, also for the purposes of preventing the offences envisaged by Legislative Decree 231/2001 as amended. 
The O.G. states that the "Group's priority goal" is to safeguard life and health for all in the company (covering employees, external staff, suppliers, guests…), protecting the company's reputation, supporting 
business continuity in areas and processes considered critical for the business in various safety and security risk scenarios. 
30 Mention is made of Art. 20 - Protection of the health and physical integrity of the workers of the National Collective Bargaining Agreement of Employees of Private Radio and Television Companies, 
31 Art. 7 – Environment and Health of the Supplementary Agreement for Group Companies in Italy

For 2023, confirming the Group's attention to the occupational health and safety of its employees, there were no 
serious injuries (duration of more than 6 months) nor cases of occupational illness or cases of injuries for external 
collaborators.  
There were also two commuting accidents with a number of days’ absence greater than 70 according to INAIL. 
Occupational health and safety in Spain are regulated and guaranteed through the occupational risk prevention 
plan and the provisions of the individual national collective agreements. The plan is jointly defined by the Group 
Health and Safety Committee and by the Prevention Service ("Servicio d e Prevención Mancomunado" or SPM), 
which is then approved by the Human Resources Department and Service Management and finally presented to 
the Risk Officer.  
We would like to point out that in Spain all collective agreements include measures to protect the health and safety 
of workers. 
Based on the objectives set out in the prevention plan, each year the SPM defines the activity plan. The Risk Officer 
has the task of approving and monitoring the plan on a quarterly basis together with the Health and Safety 
Committee. The Committee therefore does not carry out preventive activities but rather represents all employees: 
the committee consists of approx. ten people belonging to the different professional categories. Moreover, the 
SPM can perform extraordinary activities to meet or adapt to ne w regulatory needs or changes in business 
activities.  
In the course of 2023, health and safety training for various categories of workers continued through online 
courses. 
During 2023, no serious injuries were recorded whereas two minor injuries occurred among employees of the 
MFE Group in Spain. Again during 2023 there were 23 cases of accidents involving external staff. In addition there 
were two cases of occupational illness. 
During 2023, t he Prevention and Protection Service (SPM) also held coordination meetings to address relevant 
aspects relating to health and safety, both with areas of the company and external suppliers.  
Finally, the SPM carried out 10 inspections to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the safety systems in as 
many company areas.

5.1  QUALITY OF THE 
PRODUCT AND SERVICE 
FREE TV  
ENTERTAINMENT 
The MFE Group’s free -to-air offering in Italy currently consists of 16 channels and 5 radio stations covering all 
major targets for advertisers, including three long-standing generalist channels (Canale 5, Italia 5 and Rete 4), and 
the thematic and semi-generalist channels Boing, Boing Plus, Cartoonito, Iris, La5, Mediaset Extra, Mediaset Italia 
1, Top Crime, Canale 2, Tgcom24, Focus, Cine34, Twentyseven, R101TV, Radio Monte Carlo, Radio 105, Radio 
Subasio and Virgin radio TV. 
The three main channels of the Group have always been: 
 Canale 5, the Group’s main general interest channel and targeted at the modern Italian family. It is a channel 
for TV viewers between 15 and 64 years of age, with programming covering all the main television genres from 
entertainment to drama to news. 
 Italia 1, the leading Italian channel among younger viewers, with particular emphasis on American products, 
upcoming trends and fashion. It is a channel about innovation, where the most innovative programmes are 
aired. 
 Retequattro targets its programme schedule at a more mature audience in terms of age. 
The great commitment to self-produced Retequattro content also continues in 2022. Original products were shown 
on the network in prime time on 6 evenings out of 7: Veronica Gentili in Controccorrente, Nicola Porro in Quarta 
Repubblica and then Paolo Del Debbio with Dritto e Rovescio , Mario Giordano with Fuori dal Coro , Giuseppe 
Brindisi with Zona Bianca up to the co-presenting of Gianlugi Nuzzi and Alessandra Viero in the crime reports of 
Quarto Grado, an undisputed cornerstone of the schedule. 
Barbara Palombelli remained host of the pre -primetime show that opens the network’s early evening slot with 
current affairs and politics in Stasera Italia. 
Retequattro believes that part of a TV channel’s responsibility is to express a  world view and build a community, 
above all by employing its own voice. 
The MFE Group in Italy has managed to attract audiences from every age group  – with a particular focus on the 
coming generation  – and social class, thanks to its television programme scheduling and selection of 
programmes capable of meeting all TV viewers’ demands.  
The broadcasting strategies that have led to the success of the channels in Italy through the dissemination of 
products and content that the users like are the responsibility of the Programme Schedule and Distribution 
General Management in association with Content General Management.

These two departments together with the TV Committee approve the broadcasting projects. 
Once the broadcasting lines on which to build the entertainment of channels in Italy have been decided, the 
relevant Product Area – in this case, the Entertainment Department – proceeds to the selection of projects of 
interest through an analysis of the market of reference and monitoring to make sure they are in keeping with the 
broadcasting lines in the codified regulations “Manual of Audiovisual and Radiophonic Services”.

This manual guides the dissemination of content following the rules for programming, protection of minors, 
business communication, equal treatment, privacy and radiophonic regulations.  
At the same time, both qualitative (broadcasting characteristics such as type of programme, positioning on the 
programme schedule, listener target and cast of artists) and quantitative (for example: duration, hours of product, 
hourly/total cost, etc.) television product guidelines and objectives are defined. 
The Entertainment Department guarantees that the product is always in line with the values the Group wishes to 
convey and the principles contained in its Code of Ethics.  
Lastly, constant sharing of the project and shared selection of programming make sure that broadcast content 
meets the quality expectations of TV users.  
To further demonstrate the quality of the entertainment product, some examples are programmes like Striscia la 
Notizia, le Iene and Forum which, still with the objective of entertaining their audience, at the same time address 
social and contemporary topics.

TELEVISION SERIES AND FILMS 
The MFE Group broadcasts TV series that appeal to all audiences. When it selects TV series the group adheres to 
the broadcasting guidelines set and shared with the company’s top management, in addition to identifying 
products that have the potential to reach the established target audience.  
When selecting products, the TV series department evaluates the products together with the Content Department 
and company top management working closely with product marketing in an attempt to find stories that continue 
to interest the historic audience and at the same time try to broaden its user base.  
Specifically, the TV series department chooses and develops stories that highlight the principles and positive values 
of the company today and consequently also reflect the ethical principles of the Group , never coming into 
conflict with them and thus guaranteeing a product that all audiences can enjoy.  
The considerations on the choice of product also take into account the option to have content not suitable for an 
audience of minors; in this case, one opts for a shared choice with the channel that must broadcast the product. 
The MFE Group’s TV series department in Italy constantly strives to improve the quality of content, broadening the 
selection of its suppliers and turning to an ever larger number of external production companies, not to mention 
various screenwriters.  
This opening toward the market has led the Group to receive and assess about 210 original projects each year, 
a number that is deemed sufficient to fully satisfy the Group’s needs. 
The MFE Group also possesses the know -how and the organisation for selecting projects and developing the 
production of popular drama series. These products are commissioned from major national partners and, in some 
cases, are sold abroad or leveraged via the web channel, thus contributing to covering production costs.  
Through its Medusa subsidiaries, the Group ensures production and distribution of films and TV series.  
Medusa Film  is in charge of the distribution of cinematographic works  (mainly Italian). The company 
produces and purchases films exploiting the entire life cycle of the product: from the programming in cinema 
releases to the sale of television broadcasting rights in all their various forms.  
Medusa’s line -up, constantly agreed upon with the MFE Group in order to meet programming requirements, 
focuses on the Italian product in the “comedy” genre, with directors and actors who over the years have helped 
the redefine the concept of “Italian -style comedy”. In recent years, however, a space has also been created for 
products in different genres, especially “quality” ones, in order to seize on the developing tastes of viewers, who 
are increasingly attentive and knowledgeable.  
The thread that runs through all of them remains Medusa’s presence in Italian cinema, which means guaranteed 
selection, production and distribution of the best products, in an attempt to promote national and local 
artistic and professional excellence . In order to face up to the competition of foreign products, this 
commitment must always be ensured according to top industry standards.

109 
It can therefore be said that from the perspective of content, this direction has enabled the creation and promotion 
of products that are consistent with that which identifies the MFE Group, apprehending and sometimes even 
anticipating the changes in progress in Italian society. 
In short, 2023 represents the first year of return to post -pandemic normality for the cinema market, that is, the 
first year totally free of restrictions on the sale of food and drink and mandatory mask wearing.  
The process of slowly approaching pre-pandemic values therefore continues, in the knowledge that it will be very 
difficult to achieve them again as new film consumption habits have now assumed a decisive role within the 
distribution chain, especially through online distribution (OTT) platforms.  
The quantitative analysis shows that compared to 2022, revenue increased by 62% (+59% attendance): a 
comparison with the previous year is misleading however, due to the restrictions indicated (bans on food sales 
and mandatory masks). The comparison with the average for the three-year 2017–2019 period is more significant: 
in this case, there was a 16% drop in revenue and 23% drop in attendance.  
In 2023, Medusa distributed a total of 7 films (5 co-productions and 2 acquisitions) in cinemas. The first half of the 
year began with The First Day of My Life  by P. Genovese starring T. Servillo, V. Mastandrea and M. Buy, continued 
with Somebody Down There Likes Me , a documentary by M. Martone on M. Troisi, presented at the Berlin Film 
Festival and awarded the Silver Ribbon as best documentary, and ended with  Il viaggio leggendario by A. Liguori: 
the results achieved were broadly in line with expectations. The second part of the year was instead characterised 
by two typically Italian comedies (Volevo un figlio maschio by N. Parenti with E. Brignano and La guerra dei nonni by 
G. Ansanelli with V. Salemme and M. Tortora), the directorial debut of C. Bisio (L'ultima volta che siamo stati bambini) 
and Ficarra and Picone’s return to Christmas with Santocielo, by F. Amato. 
Medusa also acquired the TV broadcasting rights to 3 films released directly on the Amazon Prime online platform, 
for consumption in the coming years on the MFE Group’s free TV networks: Arrigo Sacchi - La favola di un visionario 
by N. Casadio, So tutto di te by and with R. Lipari and Il migliore dei mondi by and with M. Capatonda. 
With respect to the Medset company, the continued recovery of the entire film production and distribution chain 
has enabled the company to ensure the distribution of productions already completed, the development of new 
film projects and the effective use of its catalogue through licensing activities. 
The company also undertook scouting activity for titles in the Group’s catalogue in order to assess potential interest 
in adapting them for the French market. 
 
NEWS AND SPORTS 
In 2023, MFE consolidated its integrated system model for News and Sports across its networks and multimedia 
platforms. 
The system is based on several elements. 
The first of these is the 3 national news networks – Tg5, Tg4 , Studio Aperto – and the Sport Mediaset agency; each 
of them has specific characteristics and is geared towards a certain type of audience: 

Page 114:
 
 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 
5 ▪ Effectiveness and Sustainability of the Broadcast and Commercial 
Offering 
 
110 
 Tg5 is characterised by its leading position, completeness and impartiality in its way of making news across 
the board;  
 Studio Aperto is a news network for young people, agile and brief which emphasises the main stories and 
current events; 
 Tg4, increasingly dedicated to in -depth coverage in the evening edition, attracts Rete 4’s typical audience 
(over-55s). 
 Sport Mediaset covers events and produces in-depth reports with sports commentary.  
Studio Aperto, Tg4 and Sport Mediaset all refer to an internal news agency for the provision of content. The agency 
was set up in March 2010 and guarantees uniformity and completeness of information sources as well as working 
across media, taking in web, mobile and radio. It essentially serves as a genuine hub for the production  and 
distribution of multi-platform content across various brands. 
The digital traffic32 for Tgcom24 on web and mobile in 2023 was 2.5 million unique daily users, making a total 
monthly average of 22.6 million unique users between web and app33; 
As far as social media traffic is concerned, there are more than 2.5 million active fans  on Facebook, 1.5 
million on X, 1.1 million  on Instagram and 76 thousand followers on LinkedIn, representing growth 
compared to the previous year. 
In 2023, the WhatsApp and Threads channels were also opened with over 1.3 million and 77,000 followers 
respectively.  
In 2023, the news agency (which refers to the Tgcom24 agency) also self -produced a journalistic analysis 
documentary film on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the 1943 armistice entitled 1943 – L'ANNO CHE... 
A structured broadcast with two 100-minute episodes in early evening slots, for the thematic FOCUS channel. 
The infotainment and in-depth news analysis productions from the Videonews agency represent the second key 
element in the Mediaset network information structure. Videonews is a real factory that designs, creates, develops 
and produces content for the generalist networks, contributing to the daytime and prime-time schedule 7 days a 
week. 
The main infotainment and journalistic analysis productions from 2023 are indicated below:  
 Canale 5 daytime with Mattino 5 news, Pomeriggio 5 and Verissimo (also in its Sunday version), all leaders 
for their own commercial target audiences. Lending continuity to the information coverage, Morning news 
continued for the summer, while in the Christmas period Mattino 5 news continued its programming with a 
greater focus on current affairs, stories and politics. Afternoon infotainment too ensured continuity during 
the Christmas holidays at the end of 2023; 
 the pre -primetime Rete 4 show Stasera Italia , hosted by Barbara Palombelli, a reference point for 
information in its weekday version, which continued on Saturday and Sunday with Controcorrente (hosted

by Veronica Gentili). Nicola Porro then took the helm of the access slot in September for the weekday version 
and Augusto Minzolini for the weekend version; 
 Rete 4 in prime time, a strategic challenge in terms of Mediaset Information, continued to assert itself with a 
constant presence throughout the week through its 6 programmes: Quarta Repubblica , Fuori dal coro , 
Controcorrente Prima Serata (until May), Dritto e Rovescio, Quarto Grado and Zona Bianca. The team was 
joined in the autumn by the new Tuesday evening product hosted by Bianca Berlinguer, È sempre 
Cartabianca; 
 In-depth TV news reports: Tg4 – Diario del giorno and Studio Aperto Mag; 
 the second evenings on Canale 5 of X-Style and on Rete 4 of Confessione Reporter; 
 The Sunday daytime of Rete 4 continuing with Dalla parte degli animali  and Pensa in Grande with the 
production of 6 new episodes dedicated to 6 great stories of Italian entrepreneurship (Saviola, Gaudi, Dell’Orto, 
Maina, Sant’Anna, Giovanni Ferrari) with a repeat in the late evening slot, again on Rete4; 
 To ensure constant information and in -depth analysis during the main events of 2023, the General 
Information Division has made a significant production effort, increasing the number of its programmes. 
Firstly in daytime with Tg4 and pre -primetime time ( Stasera Italia/Controcorrente), which on several 
occasions have extended their broadcast time or shown dedicated episodes. With Quarta Repubblica and its 
“specials”, which allowed viewers to keep up with all the live updates on the country’s main events. On Canale 
5, on the other hand, there was important live coverage of national and international events with the TG5 
specials and Verissimo, such as the funeral of Maurizio Costanzo, the coronation of King Charles III, and last 
but not least the funeral of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi; 
 Finally, we would highlight E-Planet, a weekly show focusing on issues related to environmental and 
development matters, such as electric vehicles, clean energy, protecting the planet and creating sustainable 
economic models. 
The Meteo.it MFE brand represents a significant presence in multimedia content. It’s the leading Italian weather 
forecasting system, spread across TV, the web, mobile and radio, and is completely free of charge. 
Meteo.it is a highly renowned and authoritative national scientific leader, made up of a staff of specialists, 
journalists and meteorologists, as shown by over 10 million users who follow the MFE brand's forecasts each day 
across the various multimedia platforms.

With reference to sports information (third component of the integrated system), MFE, which was awarded the 
broadcasting rights for a total of 121 UEFA Champions League matches per season on its platforms for three 
years (2021–2024), continues to guarantee that the Italian public can view the best match in each Tuesday round 
of the UEFA Champions League for free on the generalist networks, including the final (also free to view online), as 
well as 104 matches on its live pay streaming service and 12 Youth League matches. 
Two other great exclusives that MFE has guaranteed in 2023, for the 2024 –2027 seasons, are the broadcasting 
rights to the Coppa Italia and the Supercoppa italiana. 
MFE was also awarded the broadcasting rights for 8 Euro 2024 qualifying  matches and the final stage of the 
Nations League.  
In addition, the 2 preliminary regattas leading up to the broadcast of the Challenge Selection Series and the 
America’s Cup in 2024 (September–October 2024) were broadcast. 
For sports information, specifically, in addition to the TV news ( SportMediaset, SportMediaset XXL and every 
Monday in the late evening slot Sportmediaset Monday Night), there is an offering dedicated to the main football 
competitions: in addition to the aforementioned UEFA Champions League live , for Serie A, there are Pressing, 
which offers the television audience fresh information both on the major championships and on the transfer 
market and, for the Coppa Italia, Coppa Italia Live. Football is joined by  a great deal of content in the motoring 
world:  
 ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, the electric single-seater championship that’s attracting increasing 
attention from the world’s leading automotive brands; renewed until 2026 
 Extreme E, the championship that uses only zero -emission electric SUVs for off -road racing in some of the

We would also highlight all the different forms assumed by the TGCom24 all-news system: the TV network, 
breaking news on generalist and thematic free -to-air networks; breaking news on the RadioMediaset radio 
network and the main national private radio stations; the TGCom24.it website, apps for smartphones and tablets, 
official accounts on social media networks (Facebook, X and Instagram) and a dedicated channel on the YouTube

The multimedia performance of information should be noted: the monthly average on TGCom24.it, web and 
mobile, was 120 million video views39 in 2023. The multimedia offering of TGCom24 is followed by an average 
of 9 million unique video users per day40.  
In relation to mobile use, the TGCom24 app exceeded a total of 4 million downloads, with an increase of 4%

compared to 2022. On the Meteo.it app, 7.1 million downloads were recorded, up by 4% compared to the year 
2022, and finally the Tg5 app, which in 2023 exceeded 1.5 million downloads, up by 5% compared to 2022.  
In terms of content, the Tgcom24 channel has enhanced the information offer characterised by the main Mediaset 
Information brands and the LIVE and multimedia imprinting of the daily news flow. In addition to the many years 
of collaboration with the Europea n Parliament and the European Commission  – thanks to the successful 
participation in international media calls  – and the consolidated regional appointments with the 
TGCOM24TOUR, the TGCOM24 programme schedule has dedicated a new fortnightly broadcasting in itiative to 
the theme of work entitled LAVOROFUTURO. The new format provides guidance for training young people and 
lends a voice to the entrepreneurial concerns of the coming generation.  
The brand also successfully continued to air educational programming with TG dei Ragazzi in collaboration with 
“la Città dei Bambini e dei Ragazzi” , at the Old Port of Genoa, which reached its 342nd episode on 31 December 
2023.

weekly programme to explore the technology that will change the future and transformations in contemporary 
professions.

The genuineness and quality of the content is guaranteed by the immediacy and contemporary quality of the news, 
thanks to the live broadcast of the content for the All -News (programming exclusively for the broadcast of the 
news) and the news channels, but also for the world of infotainment; products that come under the 3 MFE 
agencies: Tg5, Tgcom24 and Videonews. 
The configuration of the News Department encourages continuous and attentive focus on the research and 
development of news. This is guaranteed by verification of reliable and true sources, while constantly keeping an 
eye on contemporary events, in order to guarantee the audience a useful and up-to-date service. 
To this end, the MFE Group encourages the fight against the phenomenon of fake news  and celebrates 
International Fact-Checking Day. 
The creation of the services follows all the regulations in the area of occupational health and safety. This is first 
and foremost to guarantee the safety of all employees and collaborators of the Group, and in the specific case of 
news, to ensure current, true and complete information.  
In particular, those sent to war or high-risk areas, are guaranteed supplementary insurance coverage adapted 
according to the specific characteristics of the mission. These needs are monitored through a constant dialogue 
with the public institutions set in place in different countries (or bodies associated to them) that may channel and 
provide the information needed to fully guarantee the safety of the field reporters. 
With the goal of generating objective and effective debate on the arguments addressed in the different TV 
programmes, there is an attempt to develop a settlement that may be representative of freedom of expression (in 
any case guaranteed by the professiona lism of the Editors of agencies, who have a trust relationship with the 
Broadcaster), of the plurality of voices and the completeness of the news. To pursue these objectives and improve 
the qualitative performance of the products, it proved fundamental to implement a convergence between 
television and the different online media. 
The Agency Editors have a function of coordination, with absolute respect for the freedom and autonomy of the 
individual broadcasts, written, conducted and organised by independent and autonomous writing and 
editorial groups. The broadcasts deal with current events, always with attention, which is also ensured by the 
coordination of the General Information Division, to the following: issues of social inclusion  of the most 
vulnerable (at the centre of public, and televisual, debate as never before), protecting the environment, the 
risks of climate change and the opportunities offered by a transition to a green economy.  
Plus, some programmes like Quarto Grado, Mattino 5 news, Pomeriggio 5 and Verissimo perform an ongoing support 
activity for social and awareness campaigns  (for example, against the abuse of women or against fraud 
perpetrated against society’s more vulnerable categories like the elderly or the disabled). In particular, the show 
Quarto Grado  is capable of channelling important and necessary messages for the development of legal 
investigations. All these activities have led to active audience participation, at the same time demonstrating a 
broad consensus and a growing awareness of these topics. 
To allow its services to be used, the Group monitors and makes an effort to ensure that every single one of its 
viewers is placed in the optimal condition to be able to receive the news and stay informed of what is going on in

the world. Specifically, TG5, in its main edition at 8 PM provides a subtitling service for the hearing impaired 
in order to make accessing the content easier. 
As far as partnerships are concerned, within the framework of collaboration with European Bodies that has 
continued for a number of years, in 2023 RTI S.p.A. produced and broadcast the first series of television 
Information formats and content to raise awareness of the role and initiatives of the European Commission within 
the framework of the " NEXT - Generation Europa " project, with a duration of 20 months (expiring on 
20/07/2024, unless an extension agreement is reached), related to the contract signed wi th the European 
Commission, following the awarding of the tender procedure COMM/ROM/2022/LVP/0166.  
RTI also successfully took part in two other European tenders in the MEDIA sector in 2023:  
Call for tenders IMCAP -2023-INFOME/ Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development of the 
European Commission, lasting 12 months (expiry 31/07/2024), for the implementation of a broadcasting project 
dedicated to issues related to the Common Agricultural Policy, with particular at tention to the sustainable agri -
food chain and the search for excellence in the world of food. 
Call for tenders EP -COMM/SUBV/2022/MEDIA of the European Parliament for the development of a 14 -
month broadcasting project dedicated to European issues and the 2024 European elections (expiry 30/10/2024)  
Successful participation in the tenders resulted in two multimedia broadcasting projects aired on the generalist 
and thematic Mediaset networks and on TGCOM24’s digital platforms.  
Particular attention should be paid to the COTTO E MANGIATO -Menù format within partnered broadcasting 
activities, broadcast on Italia1 for 13 years with an average of 85 episodes per year. Over the seasons, the 
programme has given much, and increasing, space to topics connected with sustainability, both in the choice o f 
raw ingredients used in the recipes and the promotion of good, healthy eating habits. Suggestions for appropriate, 
planet-friendly eating habits are also a constant feature of this brand, as is the focus on training young people in 
the food sector. In 2023, the 7th COTTO E MANGIATO Scholarship was awarded for the professional training of 
Young Chefs, students at hotel schools throughout Italy, who take part in the format’s contest every year on social 
media platforms and TV.  
Through this contest, but also occasionally in collaboration with Mediafriends, COTTO E MANGIATO also puts the 
established chefs who take part in the broadcast in contact with deserving and talented young people, successfully 
promoting the entry of apprentices to the world of catering. 
Rounding out the picture, the Mediaset information system benefits from valuable original content: In 2023, the 
Mediaset and Mondadori Libri collaboration continued, based on the synergistic exchange of editorial content 
its aim is to enhance new publications and give greater visibility to authors, and to promote journalists and 
Mediaset talent as authors for new publishing projects. 
The News Department also confirmed its strategic collaboration with the IULM Master's in Journalism  by 
participating in the Scientific Committee, managing the Journalism Laboratory and with internships in the 
newsrooms of Mediaset programmes and news broadcasts.

On the technological development front, the use of CORTEX was developed in 2023, Dalet’s artificial intelligence 
system, which provides speech-to-text, automatic translation of agency scripts and recommendation, suggesting 
images for editing based on the journalist’s text and tags entered automatically.  
The implementation of the Dalet systems (MILAN and ROME) continued during 2023, with the introduction of 
some planning dedicated to the agency administrative offices (guests, deliveries, etc.) to the foreign desk (foreign 
planning), while planning for the organisational office (travel and business trips) is being studied and will be 
released in early 2024. This planning will enable timely information sharing with all users enabled to view it. On 
the Milan system, the project of archiving material older than  two years continued and TV news broadcast 
sequences were archived in order to optimise storage space for daily production. New search profiles were 
created to make searching for materials needed to make the programmes more effective. Throughout 2023, firs t 
the studies and then the implementation of the new single NEWS/SPORT system continued, which will be released 
operationally by mid-2024.  
In view of the “closure” of INEWS in early 2024, the workflows still present on that system were mapped and the 
flows were progressively transferred to the DALET system.  
The DALET NEWS system has also been introduced in the RADIOMEDIASET agencies, which have abandoned the 
various software used until now, to work solely with the shared GALAXY5 system. In December 2023, the web 
version of DALET was released to all radio hosts and authors, allowing for faster and more coordinated news 
searching and interaction between agencies. 
In 2023, installation of the graphic formats of the various programmes was completed in all studios equipped with 
Dalet technology, making it easy to switch from one studio to another if necessary. 
The studio emergency document was revised and updated, introducing the use of tablets, with the mobile version 
of Dalet (Dalet on the go) installed. 
The Dalet on the go application was installed on the mobiles (including private ones) of the journalists selected 
by the editors. 
The relocation of some programmes from Milan to Rome required the workflows that were being used to be 
updated, the introduction of 35 new Dalet workstations and training for the agencies involved. At the same time, 
the technical implementation of the Dale t playout was carried out for studio 1 of the Rome Palatino Production 
Centre. The actual broadcasting of the programmes will take place during 2024. 
On the occasion of the anniversary of the start of the war in Ukraine, in addition to the kit (mobile phone, 
microphone, tripod, etc.) that allows reports and connections to be made completely autonomously, STARLINK 
equipment for satellite internet connection, with a portable spare battery, was provided to the reporters and 
tested in the field. This enabled A/V connections to be made for more than 10 hours, in completely deserted 
locations.  
Connection kits were also used for the coronation of King Charles and later on board Coast Guard motor vessels 
for the migrant crisis and during the Israeli -Palestinian conflict in Gaza. They are used on a daily basis for 
contributions from the foreign offices in London, New York and Washington, as well as for the daily connections 
of certain guests on in-depth programmes.

The digitisation project for the raw news materials (ARCA GREZZI) in the TOC video library began. The material to 
be digitised was selected and the flow created that will allow the association of the description in EASY with the 
video file that will be arc hived in DALET’s unique archive, which will become the sole repository of all company 
news material. 
The digitisation of the still non -tapeless production streams, which should be completed by the year 2024, also 
continues. 
In the second half of 2023, journalists were also provided with headsets with a microphone for potential mobile 
work. 
Throughout 2023, the COBRORA project continued in collaboration with Côte d'Azur University, the Sorbonne, 
INA and RAI. The project involves digitising and cataloguing all TG5 reports containing images of the European 
Union from 2001 to the present day in Dalet Rome, in order to see how the image of the Union itself has changed 
over the years. 
It should be noted that the General Information Division reached over 7,700 thousand hours of self-produced 
output in 2023: around 3,000 hours of TV news  and more than 2,200 hours of infotainment  on the 3 
generalist channels; 2,200 hours of original programming on the Tgcom24 channel. These were joined by 300 
hours dedicated to sporting events divided between generalist and Mediaset thematic networks.  
Mediaset confirmed its strategy of news coverage of major events with its strengths: 
 the extension of the daytime programmes  (which continued to be broadcast even outside of peak 
periods); 
 six primetime programmes a week on Rete 4. 
 consolidation of the Mediaset broadcasting line-up with two major faces from competing networks: Bianca 
Berlinguer (Rai) and Myrta Merlino (La7) 
Concentrating all broadcasting activities of Tgcom24, TG4, Studio Aperto and Sport Mediaset productions within 
Studio 15  once again made it possible to optimise technical and production management by adopting a 
transversal model and moving towards a single continuous production and broadcasting flow for Hard News.  
To achieve a highly optimised model, the system of organisation aimed to overhaul the logic whereby line staff are 
vertically assigned to brands, and instead extend the rollout of the transversal model (not including the hosts and 
brand curators). By conce ntrating activities within a single studio in Cologno Monzese, by implementing a 
continuous and rational production flow and by optimising the organisation of line -related work, greater 
efficiencies are gained without downsizing the product.  
The innovations to processes (organisational, technological and logistics) put in place over the years have resulted 
in a significant increase in productivity and an increase in the hours produced as part of a policy directed towards 
the containment of overall costs.

RADIO 
The MFE Group’s commercial radio division includes R101, Radio 105, Virgin Radio Italy, RadioMontecarlo 
and Radio Subasio. 
Each of these stations is characterised by its own line expressed through radio programmes/formats (for example 
radio of young target programmes -Radio105-; "flow" (like format) radio -R101 and Radio Subasio -, "vertical" 
radio -Virgin Radio; “elite” radio with high-profile target-RMC; “family” radio with distinctive elements from Italian 
tradition-Radio Subasio). 
In relation to this line, maximum independence and plurality of expression is guaranteed following the industry 
regulations (Radio Television Consolidated Act) and the current company guidelines that require daily monitoring 
of the activity carried out by the artistic resources (radio speakers and guests), the topics addressed in the relative 
sources as well as the advertising content aired. 
The MFE Group undertakes to maximise enjoyment of the radio product with a widespread dissemination both 
in geographical and target audience terms, also through systematic maintenance and enhancement activity 
on the radio broadcast networks , particularly safeguarding minors by working on the language used on air 
and following the Radio Television Consolidated Act and the Group Code of Ethics. 
Also to guarantee maximum enjoyment and access for today’s listeners and with the objective to acquire new 
ones, not to mention to maximise the benefits arising from using advertising, the radiophonic department 
undertakes to constantly and progressively d evelop the multimedia activities, creating services and content 
employable through the main digital platforms and media, like smartphones, tablets and smart TV, carrying out 
specific control activities for these purposes. 
The content to be posted on websites, including that provided directly by the listeners, is supervised in order to 
make sure it is suitable to be issued; with respect to the content users make themselves, a disclaimer is filled out, 
which for minors must be signed by the individual with custody over them.  
To guarantee users’ privacy, the messaging systems used hide the mobile telephone numbers of listeners, who 
can only be contacted by the people employed in the company for that purpose. 
2023 saw a succession of national radio promotion activities. During the summer, Radio 105 brought chart-topping 
artists from the entire Italian music scene to the stages of Rimini, Messina, Paestum and Genoa. The concerts were 
broadcast on Radio 105 and R adio 105 TV. The great X Masters sports event took place during July, once again 
accompanied by Radio 105. 40 thousand square metres on the beach in Senigallia, free of physical barriers with 
the potential to limit inclusivity and sustainability (use of pl astic-free materials) moving to the beat of music. In 
September, Radio 105 moves to Genoa with “105 in the city”, a free concert at the Boat Show. RMC was the official 
radio station of Umbria Jazz, reporting on the event’s 50th anniversary with 122 hours o f live coverage from 
Perugia, 70 interviews and 10 live concerts. RMC also covered the 32nd Merano Wine Festival, Milan Beauty Week, 
the Book Fair in Turin and Estate da Re at the Royal Palace of Calabria. Virgin Radio took part in Firenze Rock, I -
Days and the Motor Bike Expo. R101 covered the Eolie Music Fest, live music in the picturesque setting of the 
Aeolian Islands. Subasio was, as usual, the official radio station of Eurochocolate.

Digital activities continued to represent significant support for radio stations in 2023, allowing important tour, 
interview and live content, etc. to be made available to the public on social media. 
 
INNOVATION IN DEFINING AND DISSEMINATING CONTENT  
In the consolidated context of multimedia video offering, the MFE Group is working through a dedicated 
organisational structure to create services and content deployable across all the main connected digital platforms 
(desktop devices, mobile devices, smar t TVs, STBs, game consoles, dongles, etc.) and to promote digital 
extension initiatives for free -to-air programmes (TV and Radio), as well as digitally enhancing the free -to-air 
programmes themselves, consequently improving advertising revenue.  
In relation to Social Media Network presence, the Group confirmed itself as one of the leading European media 
companies in creating engagement with its communities: 43.5 million total followers  on Mediaset network 
Facebook pages, over 23 million followers on Instagram accounts and over 10 million followers on X accounts. 
Although limited in number at present, Group profiles have exceeded one million subscribers on TikTok, with the 
Mediaset Infinity profile demonstrating an excellent fan base growth curve and high levels of engagement in 2023. 
The MFE digital product range is divided into two main hubs:  
 Video Hub: Total video broadcast content consumption on Mediaset’s Properties (First and Second Screen) 
came to a total of 644 million hours of video, up +35% compared to 2022. Mediaset Infinity confirmed 
its position as the chosen location for Group content consumption, driving overall growth in video 
consumption with a TTS growth rate of +47% YoY (Source: Webtrekk). The Mediaset Infinity app achieved 
24.9 million downloads in 2023, representing growth of +14% on the previous year.  
 As far as the free -to-air offering is concerned, a major project was launched in 2023 to purchase series for 
exclusive first-run availability on Mediaset Infinity. The launch strategy for this content included synergies 
both between linear and digital TV a nd internationally between Italy and Spain. One example of synergy 
between linear and digital was the Turkish soap My Home My Destiny, with the first season broadcast on Canale 
5 and the second season released exclusively on Mediaset Infinity. Since the release of season 2, the series 
has topped the Auditel Digital charts for 14 out of 16 weeks, totalling 26 million total hours watched thanks 
to an excellent performance in terms of average digital minutes (AMR Digital: 568k individuals). As part of 
MFE’s international integration process on the other hand, a range of TV series owned by Mediaset España 
was selected for assessment of its complete compatibility with the Mediaset Infinity audience. Among these 
titles, a notable success story was Escándalo: a TV series released exclusively on Mediaset Infinity, which had 
an excellent reception from the public (AMR Digital: 365k individuals). In order to make the service 
increasingly accessible, the presence of the widget gallery application has also been ex panded (already on 
Samsung, LG, Sony, Amazon, Apple TV, Sky Glass and other major vendor platforms) with the arrival of 
versions for Sony Playstation consoles and Vestel televisions.  
 Information Hub: the Information hub, under the TGCOM24 brand, is internally divided into News (under 
the TGCOM24 agency), Sports Information (under the Sportmediaset agency) and Weather Information (under 
the Meteo.it brand). During the year, the Information hub audience reached an average daily Total

Audience of 2.5 million  unique users  in 2023 (Source  Audiweb 2.0, overall perimeter with TAL), 
positioning itself under the TGCOM24 brand in third place in the Italian digital information market. Together, 
the information hub’s free apps saw around 15.3 million downloads by the end of 2023, representing 4% 
growth compared to 2022. In this context, the TGCOM24 app achieved a total of 4 million downloads, with 
the base of installations increasing by 6% compared to the previous year; in 2023 alone, there were 157,000 
downloads. The weather forecasting service (Meteo.it) achieved 7.1 million downloads, with a growth of 
4%. Downloads of the Sportmediaset app reached 2.7 million (+4% compared to 2022); in 2023 alone, there 
were 107,000 downloads. The TG5 app achieved 1.5 million downloads in 2023, growth of 5%. (Source: 
App Annie at 31 December 2023; the base of app installations considered refers only to the active versions 
distributed in the stores). MFE Radio’s set of free apps deserve special mention. Together, they saw around 
2.1 million downloads by the end of 2023, representing 12% growth compared to the base at the end of 2022. 
Note that Auditel measurement of digital audience  on different devices continued in 2023, with the aim of 
estimating online user activity related to text and video content via PC, smartphone and/or tablet, smart TV, game 
console, set-top box, net of overlap between the various devices detected. In 2023, Mediaset achieved a position 
of leading broadcaster, with a share of 44.5% calculated on the fundamental metric of TTS (Total Time Spent), 
separated from the second broadcaster by 3.1 percentage points. Mediaset’s leadership is even more pronounced 
with respect to the indicator for number of video views (Legitimate Streams), with total consumption of video 
broadcast content on Mediaset Properties (First and Second Screen) amounting to 4.2 billion (broadcast Video 
Views) for the year and a share of 50.4%, some 23 percentage points behind the second biggest broadcaster in 
the market (Source: Auditel Digital).  
MFE monitors and assesses adherence to ethical principles and principles of quality in creating digital content 
thanks to continuous dialogue with reference news agencies and entertainment brands and with the involvement 
of other departments (e.g. Legal Affairs) where necessary. 
These principles are also used for internally created and/or co -produced digital products. In this areas, MFE 
continues with its positive experience of Infinity Lab. Established in 2019, this is the first Italian hub for co -
financing and co-producing documentaries, docuseries, reports and investigations distributed on Infinity+, which 
have always had a particular connection with environmental issues and social responsibility.  
In 2023, Infinity Lab co-financed and co-produced a 6-episode documentary series on sustainable fashion entitled 
Green is the new black. The product tells the story of the new challenges in the fashion industry, looking attentively 
at the materials chosen to make clothes, the reduction of environmental impact in shopping habits and an 
awareness of the weight of consumer choices. Partnersh ips have also been confirmed with certain festivals that 
give awards to and purchase short films that address ESG issues. In particular, a short film dealing with the issue 
of violence against women received awards in 2023. 
MFE also disseminates and amplifies many of the group’s ESG initiatives through the digital area both on its digital 
channels and social platforms. 
In 2023, work to support the “ Mediaset ha a cuore il futuro ” project was consolidated by managing both the 
promotion of the Facebook and Instagram social media pages and the branded area on the Mediaset Infinity 
platform dedicated to the initiative and related content.

In particular, 13 paid social media campaigns were launched during the year on topics like climate change, food 
waste, violence against women and school leaving, resulting in a total investment of more than €20k. Furthermore, 
thanks to a careful, well -structured broadcasting plan, every major international day dedicated to a topic like 
sustainability, the environment, and social responsibility was covered, thanks to the definition and creation of 
specific content.  
The social media amplification activity on the occasion of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities is also 
noteworthy. Through its digital area, MFE broadcast a message from Chiara Bordi, one of the stars of the new I 
fantastici 5 TV series co-produced by RTI and Lux Vide, on Meta platforms and on TikTok to bring the issue of fairer 
representation for people with disabilities in cinema and television to everyone’s attention. 
Finally, with regard to privacy issues, following the guidelines regarding cookies and other tracking tools issued by 
the Italian Data Protection Authority, thorough analysis began to understand the correct application of these 
principles. In particular, t hrough the involvement of all relevant company areas, business analyses were 
completed to understand the new requirements related to personal data collection and user communication 
preferences, which were incorporated into the new Mediaset Infinity customer area released in 2023. 
 
“THE GROUP’S OFFERING IN SPAIN 
The MFE Group in Spain carefully and meticulously oversees the production and distribution of its content to offer 
a qualitatively valid product capable of representing excellence on the market.  
Both the entertainment and news content refer to “Ley 13/2022, de Julio, General de la Comunicación 
Audiovisual” which regulates the audiovisual sector, internal procedures and regulations as well as the Group 
Code of Ethics. 
Indeed, constantly living up to principles like plurality and diversity of information sources , freedom of 
expression and journalistic independence, impartiality, non-discrimination and accurate information, 
creation of content in line with corporate values as well as the application of ethical rules that pervade all 
company activities as well as all Group Companies including “associated” audiovisual content producers is 
ensured. 
 This way, independent broadcasting is guaranteed, also through internal mechanisms so as not to meet with any 
external interference in the generation of content. 
The freedom of expression and independence of MFE Group journalists in Spain are concepts reflected in the 
Group’s Code of Ethics and the Ethical Principles of Information, which envisage the “veracity, objectivity and 
independence” of all information services provided. 
Moreover, thanks to the plurality and diversity of the sources of information as well as involvement of individuals 
from various sectors of the company, the MFE Group in Spain integrates various tendencies and opinion into its 
information and entertainment programmes to offer quality audiovisual services that are representative of all TV 
viewers.

In any event, quality in creation of content is guaranteed by the Broadcasting Committee that defines the 
broadcasting strategy together with the management of the Content Department. The broadcasting strategy 
is then sent to the executive producers who are responsible for monitoring and implementing it.  
On a weekly basis the Content Commission sees to and monitors the content of the programmes distributed on 
the group’s different channels. Live programming is evaluated and monitored daily in meetings attended by the 
directors of the specific channel and executive producers of the programmes. Later, once the programmes have 
been created and presented by the producers, they  are evaluated on the basis of compliance with guidelines, 
Code of Ethics and respect for human rights, the rights of minors and the right to privacy. Once this evaluation has 
been made, the results are sent to the production companies so that they adjust the content. For children’s 
programmes, in addition to the checks mentioned above, the programme is sent to the Child Protection Authority 
for approval prior to its broadcast. 
Innovation in creation of content  is yet another fundamental factor for maintaining leadership in the 
audiovisual industry. That’s why the New Project Area is always in contact with the producers and distributors 
to stay abreast of what’s new nationally and internationally.  
To evaluate new projects, meetings are held where the content production team attend as well as the Production 
area Director and General Content Director of MFE in Spain. During the meetings the different market trends 
are taken into consideration in order to identify quality products and services in which all subjects representative 
of the audience are shown. 
Once the project has been approved, the Antenna Division takes action to develop programming strategies: 
identifying the best premiere dates, establishing the content marketing strategy, defining the launch campaigns, 
setting up the communication activity being broadcast and more generally defining all the acti vities linked to 
positioning of the programme in order to get the best performances.

To ensure the creation of content is in line with company values and the Code of Ethics, MFE in Spain has defined 
and implemented a pyramid control system  where the content generated is evaluated and monitored 
constantly.  
To improve the dissemination of the content, the MFE Group in Spain has renewed its platforms, thus managing 
to disseminate its products also on Smart TVs, supporting all advanced DRM formats and optimising performance 
for mobile devices, guaranteeing high-definition use and allowing multi-device use.  
Furthermore, programming is made available to the audience through the web platform, a tool that promotes 
access to audiovisual content and allows interaction and monitoring of ratings for the programmes and series 
offered through analysis of comments.  
Finally, given the immediacy of the information delivered with increasing frequency through social networking 
sites, the Mediaset España agency checks its sources thoroughly. For this purpose, the following activities have 
been put in place: 
 weekly broadcasting committee with the company’s top managers to check the news; 
 daily broadcasting meetings to review the content to be broadcast as well as the content already broadcast, 
analysing that which had not been adapted to the set broadcasting approach in advance; 
 ongoing dialogue among journalists and area managers to update the information; 
 daily check of the broadcast of content subject to intellectual property; 
 citations of sources when they are public and allowed to quote them; 
 confidentiality of sources when required. 
For accessibility to content, the MFE Group in Spain has maintained its commitment year after year to render 
its programming accessible to individuals with visual or hearing disabilities, as a tool for the social and cultural 
integration of these groups. 
We would highlight that, in 2023, MFE in Spain broadcast 47,198 hours of subtitled programmes, about 3,416 
hours of broadcast translated with sign language and 4,209 hours with audio description.

5.2 THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE BROADCASTING 
PRODUCT  
Through its broadcast offering in Italy and Spain, the MFE Group generates a positive impact in the communities 
in which it operates, raising awareness among the viewing audience around issues such as gender equality, 
diversity, environmental protection an d contributing to political and social democratic intervention through a 
transparent, pluralist information offering accessible to all.  
This impact also extends to the non -television platforms managed by the Group, which also allow radio and 
Internet users to access such content.  
In the more than 289,000 hours of programming broadcast on its generalist and thematic networks in Italy and 
Spain, the Group directly and indirectly supported the achievement of the UN 2030 Agenda’s Sustainable 
Development Goals. The analysis that follows aims to identify the main content that makes a significant 
contribution in this area, highlighting the topics covered for each programme and associating them with one or 
more Sustainable Development Goals.

ITALY - RADIO (EVENTS) 
There were also a number of events that Radio 105  covered as Media Partner and Official Radio. Its on -site 
presence produced radio links, live broadcasts of programmes and live quotes from speakers. The goals achieved 
are specified as follows: 
MILAN GAMES 
WEEK&CARTOOMICS 
 
MGW&Cartoomics is the great annual event 
that combines the most important Italian event 
dedicated to video games, e -sports, digital 
entertainment and geek culture, with the 
historic event that for years has celebrated the 
world of comics, publishing and 
entertainment. Over 100, 000 visitors flocked 
to the Fair's pavilions from 24 to 26 November 
2023. Radio 105, as Official Radio, broadcast 
its live programmes over the three days of the 
event, conducted all the activities of the main 
stage through its speaker Bryan Ronzani and 
signed the artistic line -up through the 
presence of live music. 
GIFFONI FILM FESTIVAL 
 
 
From 20 to 29 July 2023, Giffoni Vallepiana was 
the venue for the 53rd edition of the Film 
Festival dedicated to children. The 
protagonists and jurors of the event are 
children and adolescents from all over Italy 
and the world (with a hard core of young 
people from the regions of southern Italy). 
Every day the jurors meet various guests 
belonging mainly to the film and television 
world, with whom they engage in a debate, 
asking them questions. Theme of the 2023 
edition "Indispensables", a term dedicated to 
the many jurors of the various sections, from 
all over the world. They played the most 
important role: participating in the screenings 
of the films in competition and deciding the 
winner. The feature films planned for today are 
united by stories focused on the importance of 
the family and how important it is never to give 
up and fight to the end, in the name of one's 
ideals. Radio 105 followed the festival with 
daily radio links, interviews with the 
protagonists and evening music shows in the 
square open to everyone, musically signing the 
Giffoni Music Concept format. 
IMOLA SUMMER 
SOUND PER LA 
ROMAGNA 
 
 
For the first time, the Italian urban scene has 
come together in a single great charity event: 
IMOLA SUMMER SOUND FOR ROMAGNA! On 
Saturday 29 July, the most important names in 
the current rap and trap scene performed at 
the Autodromo Enzo and Dino Ferrari in Imola 
(Bologna) in support of the population of 
Romagna affected by the flood. Imola Summer 
Sound for Romagna was born from the desire 
of SFERA EBBASTA, LUCHÈ and SHIVA to bring 
together friends and colleagues in a single 
unmissable day that puts music at the service 
of others. The proceeds from ticket sales were 
donated to the Emilia -Romagna Agency for 
Territorial Security and Civil Protection. Radio 
105 was the Official Radio of the event. 
SAVE THE SEA&PLASTIC 
FREE TOUR 
 
The "105 SAVE THE SEA" tour continued in 
2023, the itinerant campaign to raise 
awareness in favour of the care of the seas and 
beaches promoted by Radio 105, Trenitalia 
Regional and the Onlus Plastic Free. On the 
occasion of "Plastic Free July" - the month in 
which citizens from all over the world unite 
with the aim of reducing the use of plastic and 
promoting sustainable choices - the non-profit 
organization has carried out 184 cleaning 
interventions in cities, beaches, parks and 
rivers throughout Italy. R adio 105 and 
Trenitalia promoted the initiative on air, online 
and on board trains, recounting the work, 
passion and determination of Plastic Free 
volunteers through radio -tv connections and 
on social media, with the participation of some 
of the broadcaste r's speakers. The tangible 
results of the project exceeded expectations: 
during the month of July, more than 4,000 
volunteers were involved and more than 35 
tons of plastic and waste were removed.  
On www.105.net/savethesea users had the 
opportunity to find all the information about 
the initiative, the videos of the clean -up 
interventions in which the Ambassadors of 
Radio 105 participated and the interviews with 
the volunteers and local representatives of the 
Onlus. 
    
ROME MARATHON 
 
 
Radio 105 has also been confirmed for the 
2023 Official Radio of Run Rome The 
Marathon, an important event for a radio that 
makes the supervision of the territory one of its 
strengths following its vocation to marry the 
passions of its listeners. The event combines 
the sports component (the 42km route open to 
professionals and the 10km relay) with playful 
moments of entertainment and music that 
accompany the non -competitive Fun Run, 
open to all. Radio 105 is present at the start 
and finish with its own speakers to mark the 
start of the various batteries of runners, along 
the way with music and a team of mo tivators 
to accompany the runners to the finish line and 
finally to the village of La Stracittadina, where 
the fun soul of the event is best represented. 
The event is also proposed as a link with the 
territory, the route through numerous points 
of cultural  interest in Rome and areas less 
frequented by tourist circuits, involving in first 
person also citizens who are called to actively 
participate as spectators. The relevant novelty 
of this 2024 is the concept of the ‘water 
marathon’ from which the new hasht ag # 
runforwater was coined ": " water is at the 
center of everything, it is a source of life and is 
in symbiosis with runners because they 
constantly need water to quench their thirst 
and hydrate properly. It is in perfect symbiosis 
with the marathon, a d ifficult, complex race, 
where perseverance is required to reach the 
finish line. The marathon is a way of life and 
water is a symbol of life». 
SIOS (STARTAUPITALIA 
OPEN SUMMIT) 
 
As part of the editorial project, also confirmed 
for 2023, dedicated to the world of start -ups,

The main forms of sales for display advertising are organised by programme and by sets of commercials (target 
modules), while a relative price list is created for special positions within commercial breaks (very first, first, 
second and last).  
Another way of advertising and selling products via television is product placement. This form of advertising 
sales takes place through the definition and creation of projects in collaboration with the client. There are two 
forms available: product insertion in programmes or the construction of programmes fully financed by the client. 
From an internal control point of view, the Group takes special care to select which advertising campaigns are 
broadcast. To this end, the main criterion is compliance with current legislation on advertising.  
Compliance verification is applied in full respect for the advertiser’s autonomy in creative and communication 
choices and is aimed at protecting the company (as well as the advertiser) with respect to the legal status of the 
communication to be broadcast. This is expressed in the preliminary assessment of what might be the "critical" 
elements of the message (as well as in the identification, where possible, of the actions necessary to ensure that 
the advertising complies with the rules).

These control procedures aim to avoid any complaints that could lead to the early termination of the campaign, as 
well as fines and civil/penal sanctions against (also) the broadcaster. 
Refusal to broadcast the advertising message can only occur in cases where obvious critical issues in the 
communication of a legal nature cannot be avoided. 
Another assessment criterion that would affect an advertising campaign being broadcast on Mediaset networks is 
the conformity of the message to the broadcasting policy of the networks. 
With respect to its target audience, the MFE Group applies strict selection on advertising that relates to or belongs 
to certain product sectors  which - even if lawful and legitimately publishable - could be considered as not 
compliant with the broadcasting policy (e.g. the Group does not advertise weapons or legal cannabis) or in relation 
to the content of the message itself (e.g. vulgarity, violence, etc.). 
This editorial judgement varies depending on the characteristics of the medium and therefore also of the target 
audience for which the advertising is intended. 
The MFE Group is committed to broadcasting messages that have more than just a commercial purpose. To that 
effect, MFE is a founding member of the Fondazione Pubblicità Progresso, represented by Publitalia ‘80 along 
with the major players in communication in Italy. This foundation aims to contribute to solving the civil, 
educational and moral problems of the community by placing communication at the service of society. 
Pubblicità Progresso promotes training initiatives on social communication at leading Italian universities; it 
sponsors events, exhibitions and initiatives dedicated to important social issues; it sponsors social communication 
campaigns carried out by non-profit organisations; and it holds the Festival of Social Communication for training 
and public educational purposes. In addition to paying a membership fee, the sponsoring members provide their 
work free of charge for the implementation of the Foundation's activities. 
Every year, Pubblicità Progresso draws the attention of the authorities and public opinion to create greater 
awareness on a specific theme by implementing communication campaigns using contributions from promoting 
partners; by way of example, past themes h ave included campaigns on anti -smoking, organ donation, gender 
equality, anti-racism, sustainability and volunteer work. 
Product innovation has always been one of the main drivers for Publitalia ’80 which, in 2017, created a new 
General Management dedicated, initially, to developing the potential connected with Smart TVs, a rapidly growing 
strategic medium in Italy, which allows new ways in which viewers use content to be identified.  
The Management has focused its activities on developing and implementing new dedicated advertising formats, 
delivered on linear networks but also within the Group’s OTT platform, Mediaset Infinity, made available in 2018 
also for internet-connected TVs.  
Another of the Management’s areas of activity concerns the collection of data, fully respecting the privacy of the 
Group’s media viewers and users, for the purposes of building data-driven products and campaigns that enhance 
customer communication in all the Group’s digital media. From internet-connected Smart TV to Digital, Digital Out 
Of Home and the Digital Audio product, also launched in 2017.

The tech stack available to the Group and the expertise of the AdTech Management team provide the market with 
all-addressable solutions that meet a wide variety of communication goals, from branding to performance, and 
that seamlessly enable the scheduling of several screens, boosting and optimising the efficiency of the campaigns.  
Following the acquisition of the mobile data company Beintoo in 2020, Management activity has been enhanced 
with measurement products and services that can analyse the effectiveness of scheduling on internet -connected 
Smart TVs, in terms of Drive to Site or Drive to Store. In addition, given the vast offering of digital media available, 
the Management has developed the model further, expanding its scope to include campaigns on linear and digital 
TV (web and audio). 
In addition to teams dedicated to product development and data analysis, marketing and sales support, one part 
of the Management is the International Marketing team that observes and analyses international trends and 
indicators and supports the Group’s international sales house, Publieurope. 
The MFE Group in Spain  believes that the responsible emission and management of advertising are both 
fundamental elements of the business and has therefore implemented specific management and control 
mechanisms.  
Publiespaña S.A.U. manages the Group’s advertising activities in strict compliance with the applicable legislation 
and with the specific guidelines defined by the Association for the Self -Regulation of Commercial 
Communication, which the company has been part of since 1995.  
In recent years, Publiespaña S.A.U. undertook an internal reorganisation  process to create as uniform a 
structure as possible with the Directorate -General for Contents; the central figure in this reorganisation is the 
Director-General, who is responsible for the management and sale of advertising and constantly works in close 
liaison with the Chief Executive Officer.  
For the purposes of the internal supervisory system, a commercial policy has been implemented which allows 
improved monitoring of the advertising content prepared. This is examined and monitored weekly by three 
Directorates General (Sales, Digital Media, M arketing, Operation and Sale services), who monitor the correct 
broadcasting of the content. 
These Directorates work in close collaboration with the Group Legal Department. 
In order to avoid any proceedings for misleading advertising, MFE España voluntarily submits any doubtful case 
in advance to the Association for the Self-Regulation of Commercial Communication (Autocontrol).  
The internal monitoring process of advertising content  also provides further verification, in collaboration 
with the Legal Department, even after airing (in the event of disputes or claims for compensation). 
The MFE Group in Spain performs further internal reviews to regulate televised content for children ; this 
monitoring and control includes issues regarding the advertisement of certain food products (to prevent obesity), 
messages on the environment, advertising toys, and the promotion of medicinal products or alcoholic beverages. 
The same diligence is applied in the field of audiovisual commercial communication (advertising, promotion, 
sponsorship and product placement) and self-promotion.

5 ▪ Effectiveness and Sustainability of the Broadcast and Commercial

145 
However, despite adopting all possible measures to ensure responsible management of both advertising content 
and distribution, there have been situations in which the established procedures were not able to resolve potential 
non-compliance. 
Further compliance checks are carried out with regard to advertising spots for the gambling and betting sector. 
 
In 2023, the MFE Group in Spain launched Mediaset Cross, a product that offers advertising planning based on 
customer data, leveraging the Data Planner (DP) for campaigns on Non-Internet-Connected Linear Television. This 
tool improves the effectiveness of ads, moving beyond traditional sociodemographic profiles. New segments such 
as Cross -Beauty, Cross -Motor, CrossCinema & Shows and Cross -Health and Pharma have been introduced. 
Constant communication with customers, transparent contractual conditions and t he collaborative resolution of 
any problems during the development of campaigns have taken priority. Use of artificial intelligence (AI) has also 
enabled further optimisation of campaigns, allowing for more precise audience segmentation.  
Furthermore, innovative advertising formats and advanced technologies are continuously developed to offer 
customers the best possible communication tool. 
The MFE Group in Spain is committed to ensuring that the collection and analysis of data for the purposes of 
advertising campaigns always take place in accordance with current legislation.  
5.4  PROTECTION OF MINORS 
The MFE Group has always been attentive to the protection of minors. For this purpose, the Company continuously 
assesses transmissions and pays close attention to the impact that these can have during a child’s developmental 
years. 
Below are a few of the commitments that the MFE Group has undertaken to protect minors: 
 compliance with all applicable regulations , including the Audiovisual Media Services Directive 
(Legislative Decree 208/21), which incorporates the provisions contained in Directive 2018/1808/EU, and the 
Self-Regulation Code Concerning Television and Minors signed in November 2002, which commits the 
Group’s networks to the monitoring of programmes offered to make sure it observes the constraints in place 
to protect young viewers.  
 classification of programmes, leading to the identification of content “ that may impair the physical, mental 
or moral development of minors ” (transmitted with all the specific warning and encryption apparatus) and to 
flag drama products on all linear and non-linear platforms, free of charge and pay per view, through coloured 
dots (green dot: suitable for everyone; yellow dot: recommended for children accompanied by an adult; 
flashing red dot: recommended for adults; fixed red dot: potentially harmful for minors or prohibited for 
children under 14). Further information on the programmes  – useful for directing users’ choices, also in 
relation to the protection of minors – is provided through information tools accompanying the content (e.g. 
EPG for digital terrestrial, programme information on the web and apps); 

Page 150:
 
 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 
5 ▪ Effectiveness and Sustainability of the Broadcast and Commercial 
Offering 
 
146 
 the offering dedicated specifically to minors , thanks to 24 -hour programming of the three free -to-air 
channels Boing (from 2004), Cartoonito (from 2011) and Boing Plus (from 2019). 
Appropriate corporate structures ( Directorate for Regulation and Institutional Requirements and 
Directorate for Documentation and Institutional Analysis) preside over compliance with the provisions for 
the protection of minors in broadcasting content, in order to guarantee programming that complies with the 
protection of minors for every service offered, also in compliance with the Audiovisual Media Servi ces Directive 
(Legislative Decree 208/21) and the Media and Minors Code. 
The MFE Group is also committed to promoting responsible TV consumption by users , planning periodic 
campaigns on the use of parental control: in these the viewer is reminded of the possibility of activating the 
blocking device through the set -top box settings to prevent the viewing of V.M.14 content potentially harmful to 
minors. 
There is also a link that takes users straight to the parental control feature - and to the Committee for the 
Application of the Media and Minors Code web pages and Internet Works Regulation - available to users on the 
Mediaset Group website (www.mediasetinfinity.mediaset.it).  
From the date of signing the Self-Regulation Code Concerning Television and Minors (November 2002), the Group 
has participated via its own representative (as Vice Chairman) to help the Committee apply the Code and has 
always made itself available for active discussion in the area of events, conferences and study days promoted by 
institutions, research centres and universities on the most pressing emerging issues. This participation was also 
confirmed upon composition of the current Committee (2021 –2024 term). In particular, in 2023, Mediaset was 
part of the Commission to revise the Media and Minors Code, established within the Committee, which drew up 
the draft of the new text, which aims to reformulate requests to safeguard minors in light of the complex reality of 
the current situation. The proposal to revise the Code was submitted to the Italian Ministry of Enterprises and 
“Made in Italy” in November 2023, to initiate the procedure envisaged in Article 37 paragraph 6 of Legislative 
Decree No. 208/21 and is awaiting definitive approval.  
The Group has also kept its role on the Advisory Board of the Safer Internet Centre for the Italia-Generazioni 
Connesse project, coordinated by the MIM – Ministry of Education and Merit. TV news and public service and in-
depth information programmes focused continuously on the issue of cyberbullying and the potential risks 
connected with the Internet.  
As part of the institutional initiatives, following the signing of the Pietrarsa Manifesto – a “call to action” from 
the Italian Data Protection Authority addressed to all communication operators, in order to educate children about 
the conscious dissemination of their personal data in digital en vironments – in 2023 Mediaset launched a series 
of activities (also commissioning qualitative research with focus groups made up of children/young people aged 
7 to 13) relating to how younger members of society relate to the main devices, focusing on manag ing sensitive 
data. The evidence that emerged represented the starting point for the institutional campaign “Occhio ai dati, 
ragazzi!” (Mind your data, guys!) within the “Mediaset ha a cuore il futuro” project, comprising a series of spots 
broadcast on our generalist and thematic TV channels between July and August (the campaign was also reaffirmed 
by the three agencies, radio stations, websites and Instagram and Facebook pages of the Group).In addition to 
this initiative specifically aimed at minors, again  in 2023, “Mediaset ha a cuore il futuro” continued in its 
commitment to raise awareness around issues of interest to society and which are particularly topical and relevant 

Page 151:
 
5 ▪ Effectiveness and Sustainability of the Broadcast and Commercial 
Offering SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 
 
147 
as younger members of the public grow and mature: in particular, the messages for the “Invito alla lettura” 
(Invitation to read) campaign and for “Earth Day” explicitly referred respectively to the example and legacy to be 
left to the people of the future. Following the opening (in the first months of the year) of the “Mediaset ha a cuore 
il futuro” social media pages, the “Pensa prima di scrivere” campaign on cyberbullying and “Non cadere nella 
rete” campaign on Internet addiction were repeated on Facebook  and Instagram – in addition to the campaigns 
for “World Play Day”  – which focus on issues particularly close to the coming generation (for more detailed 
information on the “Mediaset ha a cuore il futuro” project, see the paragraph dedicated to initiatives aimed at the 
community). 
Regarding commercial communication, the advertising sales house Publitalia ‘80 also supervises compliance 
with the provisions contained in the Self-Regulatory Code of Commercial Communication. 
Regarding the participation of minors in the content produced, the MFE Group in Spain, in addition to following 
the procedures issued by the Community of Madrid Labour Department, has drawn up a manual in which 
all necessary information concerning the rights of minors is collected to ensure children’s activities on television 
are suitable and to ensure that their right to education and enjoyment of their leisure is not violated. This manual 
is available on the intranet and is provided to all production comp anies who employ minors to implement the 
measures presented. 
Furthermore, the Code of Ethics of the MFE Group in Spain states that, as a basic principle, "no one should behave 
in such a way as to induce, promote, favour, permit or allow acts or attitudes that could be characterised as prostitution or 
corruption of minors". 
As for the impact of the content transmitted to minors, the Spanish regulation requires the classification of the 
audiovisual content to be transmitted , defined in the framework of content self -regulation, signed by the 
operators of free -to-air television in 2015 and under the supervision of the Spanish National Commission on 
Markets and Competition (CNCM). According to this self -regulation framework, al l televised content must be 
classified, except for news and events broadcasting (sport, music, culture, politics, bullfights and bull runs). 
For these purposes, the Department of Institutional Relations  works continuously in close contact with the 
Antenna Department in order to clarify and qualify any content that may have an impact on regulations for 
minors. 
The age classification established determines the time slot in which each programme may be broadcast. 
Furthermore, prior to the transmission of programmes involving children, a preliminary approval by the Child 
Protection Authority is required in addition to the aforementioned verification. 
Finally, thanks to the Parental Control system, the Group ensures a safe browsing environment for registered 
users on the Mitele platform and on all devices. On websites with specific content aimed at children and young 
people, the advertising used is segmented to avoid the risk of promoting unsuitabl e products or services that do 
not comply with the rules described above.  
As part of its audiovisual activities, Mediaset España adheres to a strict framework that requires compliance with 
current legislation, self-regulation codes and sector guidelines.

During 2023, no proceedings were initiated against the MFE Group in Spain for possible violations of regulations 
and/or voluntary codes relating to the classification of programmes in relation to the protection of minors. 
5.5  PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
The MFE Group considers respect for and protection of intellectual property to be of strategic importance and, to 
protect its audiovisual rights, prosecutes those responsible for pirated transmission of its content, through every 
competent body.  
We start with careful monitoring using specialised companies and, once we have identified pirated content, we 
proceed to caution the pirates, with the help of external legal firms where required, and in the event of repeat 
offences file administrative actions with AGCOM via civil and criminal lawsuits, both to prevent offences and 
to obtain compensation. 
These actions have resulted in legal measures with significant compensatory obligations which, although pending 
further stages in some cases, confirm the legal direction of copyright protection. Particular attention was also paid 
to anti-piracy activity for Group-owned films in cinemas. 
The same level of attention for intellectual property is also recommended to internal production facilities, for 
which the Collective Management of Copyright and Related Rights provides preventative advice on request. 
The Group is also present in all national and European institutions that deal with copyright legislation.  
As evidence of the importance and care that the MFE Group dedicates to the protection of intellectual property, 
the Code of Ethics 41 has a specific article on this subject stating that anyone processing data, information or 
documents regarding intellectual and/or industrial property rights within MFE Group companies must do so with 
the utmost diligence, accuracy and confidentiality.  
In the case of foreign subsidiaries such as Medset, external legal firms meeting the local regulatory requirements 
act to protect intellectual property and copyright. 
In addition, RTI has a specific O.G. ("Procurement of television productions and purchase of formats and 
licences") which governs this case. 
The reporting activity already undertaken by our group from 2014 in accordance with the Regulation on protecting 
copyright within electronic communication networks (Ruling no. 680/13/CONS, as amended by Ruling no. 
189/23/CONS), for shutting down pirate web sites who transmit cinema and TV series content to which we hold 
the usage rights, continues.  
With Resolution 189/23/CONS dated 26 July 2023, AGCOM introduced significant changes to the Regulation, in 
 
41 Both the Code of Ethics adopted by Mediaset SpA and its Italian subsidiaries in 2019 and the "Code of Ethics" adopted by MFE contain a specific provision on the protection of intellectual property, according 
to which, considering the extensive assets of intellectual and/or industrial property rights held by the Group "all Addressees whose activities, duties or functions in any way involve processing data, information 
or documents regarding intellectual and/or industrial property rights within Group compani es are therefore obliged to protect them with the utmost diligence, accuracy and confidentiality”. It also stipulates 
that "the intellectual and/or industrial property rights on products, works and/or knowledge developed in the working environ ment belong to the companies of the Group that hold the right to exploit them, 
according to the methods and times deemed most appropriate, in compliance with the regulations applicable from time to time" and that "in the same way, the MFE Group respects and protects the intellectual 
and industrial property rights of others, ensuring that only original products and works, duly licensed by the legitimate owners and used in accordance with the authorisations received, are used in the company's 
activities (both production and commercial)".

light of the new measures introduced by Commission Recommendation (EU) on combating online piracy 
of sports and other live events of 4 May 2023; as well as the law no. 93 of 14 July 2023 containing “Provisions 
for the prevention and suppression of the illicit diffusion of content protected by copyright through electronic 
communications networks”. 
In particular, law no. 93/23 attributed new powers to the Authority in order to strengthen its functions to combat 
online piracy activity in a more effective and timely manner, providing for the use of a platform (Piracy Shield) 
which uses a machine -to-machine system to enable automated management of right holder reports in order to 
guarantee timely and effective protection of rights and, in particular, intervention with in thirty minutes of the 
report. 
More precisely, during the broadcast of a live sporting event, rights holders can access Piracy Shield to report the 
services to be blocked.  
Following receipt of the report sent by the rights holder, the Internet service providers proceed to shut down the 
pirate site within 30 minutes.  
In the event of non-compliance with the order to disable access to the site, Agcom applies the penalties referred 
to in law 31 no. 249 of July 1997, notifying the bodies of the judicial police. 
The MFE Group in Spain has defined procedures to control the flow of content to various platforms to guarantee 
the exercise of its intellectual property rights, while carrying out technical audits to review their correct application. 
The Mediaset Group in Spain has always been at the forefront of all initiatives aimed at combating piracy and 
protecting intellectual property.We would highlight the existence of the Property Management procedure that 
establishes and regulates rights and duties in this area. 
Intellectual property is also guaranteed in all contracts with figures (authors, artists, presenters, etc.) who take 
part in a television production. 
 In addition, MFE has an external content monitoring service on YouTube  which tracks and removes all 
content owned by the Group from this channel. 
The intellectual property rights of programmes broadcast live and on-demand via online platforms are protected 
by specific internal control systems  that the company applies before the programmes are aired. The Group 
examines and defines the different contractual clauses of all the contents produced and transmitted on the various 
channels with the support of the Legal Department. 
The management of the Multi-Platform Department ensures that all content offered via various websites has 
the appropriate broadcasting rights in the contract with the producer in question. 
MFE has adopted a contractual monitoring system  for films produced by Telecinco Cinema which combats 
illegal access to content produced while the film is shown in cinemas (from film release until viewing on DVD/Blu-
ray). 
It should be noted that the Code of Ethics of MFE in Spain also regulates all aspects relating to the defence of 
intellectual property.

5.6  AUDIENCE INTERACTION AND CUSTOMER 
SATISFACTION 
FREE TV  
The Group continuously monitors customer satisfaction to improve its services and allow its viewers to enjoy 
excellent products. It’s thanks to the Auditel panel that the MFE Group can track the behaviour of the television 
audience continuously throughout the day; it is also able to detect the number of people watching television in 
each time slot, which channel/programme is viewed and for how long. Each viewer is classified according to socio-
demographic variables such as sex, age, geographical area and level of education. 
Consequently, both the quantitative and qualitative appreciation of each individual transmission are known. 
This analysis also allows the individual items of content offered to be assessed at a quantitative level.  
Additionally, the Group is active on social media to generate engagement and maintain a relationship with its 
own users and end users, via Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and X (formerly Twitter) and on network and 
radio and TV programme sites, thus establishing direct dialogue with the public to collect comments or reports, 
also in the event of any sudden changes to the programming schedule or sudden cancellations.  
NEWS 
As for the world of News, each production has a social media activity that is managed by a dedicated company 
structure, which constantly interfaces with the programme lines for sharing content to be published. Every 
individual Videonews programme has an inbox to which viewers can send reports.  
TGcom24 is constantly upgrading social media activity by agency staff. In particular, as early as 2022 TGcom24 
consolidated its presence on social platforms with its Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn and X accounts and constantly 
updated its dedicated channel on the YouTube platform. The Brand also has a live inbox ( tgcom24@mediaset.it) 
available to viewers and users for reports and requests for clarification. Interaction with TGcom24 readers/viewers 
takes place on 2 levels:  
 Website: nearly 22 million unique users and over 217 million page views per month in 202342. Readers 
can comment on the news published after logging in to the Mediaset Community. Comments are moderated 
and inserted at the bottom of the articles; the most interesting comments are shown on the site home page.  
 Social media: readers can comment on posts in relation to news, videos and photo galleries on Tgcom24; 
agency staff moderate the comments. From January 1 to December 31, 2023, there was a significant increase 
in traffic on Tgcom24 social media platforms. In particular, the official Facebook page has over 2.5 million 
fans (Source: Facebook Insights), the official X profile has 1.5 million followers, Instagram has more than 
1.1 million followers  and the LinkedIn profile has a total of 77,000 followers. Finally, the WhatsApp 
 
42 daily average on a monthly basis - source: Audiweb – (up to November 23) 

Page 155:

Offering SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 
 
151 
and Threads channels were also opened in 2023, with over 1.3 million and 77,000 followers respectively. 
 The main television ratings are analysed to determine the visibility and following of news products. 
Quantitative research instruments permit analysis of their reception , optimising the handling of the 
content on offer and assessing different deviations from the broadcasting objectives . The quantitative 
analysis is then enhanced by qualitative assessments and assessments of the competitive context, with the 
aim of offering the best product to the end user. The same reporting is also used on a B2B level as a valid tool 
for advertising investors; the investors are thus able to understand the true potential of a product and its 
ability to speak to the target audience of the advertisers. 
RADIO 
The Group radio channels collect feedback and comments from listeners via messaging (SMS and WhatsApp, 
Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, voice mail, direct contact via the radio channel phone number) and in some cases 
users are even contacted to give their opinions live on air. The feedback collected may concern topics discussed 
on the air, the selection of music tracks, or guest speaker interventions during live broadcasts. To guarantee users' 
privacy, the messaging systems hide the mobile telephone numbers of listeners, who can only be contacted by the 
people employed in the company for that purpose. 
Social managers  and moderators constantly monitor the content published spontaneously by users and 
censor any material that is discriminatory, presents risk of child pornography, is offensive to public sensibilities 
or that could be harmful to an audience of minors. Any content uploaded to the sites by users is subject to 
disclaimers, again to guarantee privacy and protect minors. 
The radio sector also has surveys on public appreciation , through TER43 (Tavolo editori radio)  and in 
collaboration with Gfk, Ipsos and Doxa. The surveys consider the listening figures (on an average day, seven days 
and average quarter of an hour). 
ADVERTISING SALES HOUSE 
Publitalia '80 and the Group’s other sales houses implement many types of survey to monitor customer 
satisfaction.  
One of the main ways is to monitor listeners and this takes place via:  
 The daily submission of an e-mail to the entire sales force with the most significant data of the television day 
and a summary of the weekly listeners;  
 The weekly submission to more than 10 thousand customers of the Top of the Week on Mediaset networks, 
which collects the best audience results of programmes broadcast via the Group's broadcast companies. 
Analysis of the effectiveness of advertising campaigns is carried out through:  
 
43 The RADIO TER survey is a representative sample survey of the Italian population (aged 14 and over) on listening to public and private, national and local radio broadcasters.

TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION FOR USER INTERACTION 
The MFE Group has always been in line with the most recent technological developments; it has adopted one of 
the leading and most innovative B2C interaction tools , Zendesk and Urban Airship for handling outbound 
communication. 
These tools enable a relationship with users that both enhances the experience of using the services and allows 
the reporting and management of technical issues. 
Several touchpoints are active, including e-mail, live chat, WhatsApp and SMS. 
Interaction with customers is an important tool for ensuring an adequate quality of service at all times, informing 
users about content and suggested broadcasts as well as assisting them in the event of problems with access or 
use. 
Interaction with users also takes place through application modules within the apps which allow, for example, 
the expression of approval towards participants in a programme or live televoting. 
The Digital Business department  monitors the consumption behaviour  of digital users to measure the 
performance of individual content items and brands, as well as to improve the usability of digital destinations. 
This monitoring is performed using tools such as Webtrekk.

153 
Optimised presentation of property offerings is also achieved through the use of recommendation engines with 
the ability to offer the content most consistent with users’ interests and address them with content -related 
marketing communications. 
With particular reference to paid services, MFE constantly monitors customer satisfaction through such tools as 
NPS (Net Promoter Score)  and surveys of the entire customer and ex -customer base, aiming to identify the 
main actions for correcting and developing the service and ensuring the highest standards of quality for customers. 
The MFE Group in Spain is in constant contact with its users, in addition to the standard "audiometric" 
detection methodologies, also through different applications. In this way, users can participate in the programs 
broadcast and make their voices heard, having the opportunity to influence and make important decisions in 
primetime programs. In addition, with the use of dedicated spaces in the web platform, competitions or 
initiatives have been activated to collect possible proposals for content from the public such as photos or videos. 
All content is viewed before publication. Similarly, users can send their opinions, complaints, suggestions or 
questions through the different mailing addresses of the MFE Group in Spain. In each website there is also a 
"Contact form" through which users can further indicate their opinions, complaints or suggestions. A team of 
people, from the Management of the cross -platform area , evaluates all the comments received, the 
responses to the surveys and the evaluations expressed in the different channels. Depending on the type of 
comment, the team evaluates the responses received in coordination with the producers of each content. 
Over the last few years, specific working groups have been created, under the supervision of the Director of 
Antenna, in collaboration with the Self-Promotion Department and the  Marketing and Programming 
Department, in order to develop cross-cutting product promotion strategies on all MFE Group vehicles in Spain. 
In particular, during 2023, 8 qualitative studies (5 Focus Groups and 3 Online Marketing studies) were carried 
out on the audience of the MFE Group in Spain, which saw the participation of 579 people.

6.1 RESPONSIBLE MANAGEMENT OF 
THE 
SUPPLY CHAIN 
In carrying out its own characteristic activities, the Group interacts with a multiplicity of suppliers for the 
acquisition of current goods and services as well as for investments in tangible and intangible assets, the 
latter consisting mainly of multi-year rights to use audiovisual content.44 
Given the peculiarities of their products and services, all Group companies use Italian and Spanish suppliers where 
possible to promote local business in the areas in which they operate.

changes, increases of internal work capitalised and provision for risk.

(**) The item refers to the increases in the related categories of tangible and intangible fixed assets. 
As for the purchase of multi -year broadcasting rights , it is necessary to underline the high incidence of 
expenses towards the main American majors and towards the holders of sports broadcasting rights in the 
total investments of the Group. As can be seen from the tables, in 2023, about 84% of MFE Group spending in Italy 
went to Italian suppliers, while 86% of MFE Group spending in Spain went to Spanish suppliers. 
FAIRNESS IN SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS 
Collaboration, supply and contracts regarding third -party business relationships with MFE Group companies in 
general contain an explicit reference to the Code of Ethics (see also paragraphs 1.3 and 3.2 and the Corporate 
231 Compliance Programmes) and state that failure to comply with the rules set forth therein may constitute a 
breach of the contractual obligations assumed, with the consequent option of cancelling any contracts made with 
any company in the group.  
Furthermore, the Group has joined the initiative promoted by Assolombarda (extended to the main Italian 
companies of the Group), which started on 27 May 2014, signing up to the Italian Responsible Payment Code, 
the first ever code in Italy for responsible payments. In taking this step, the MFE Group has committed to meeting 
the payment times agreed on with its suppliers and in general to promoting a culture of prompt, transparent 
payments. 
MFE is part of the first group of Italian and multinational companies founding the Code and, in compliance with 
its provisions, it has declared that average payment times contractually defined with its suppliers also for 2023 
were 60–90 days and relative payment dates were duly complied with.  
Note that the selection45 of suppliers and the goods or services to be acquired is based on the evaluation of 
various parameters, such as the quality and price of the good or service, guarantees of after -sales services, as 
well as promptness and efficiency. When selecting suppliers, great attention goes into verifying their reliability 
and seriousness in terms of compliance with current legislation and regulations governing their activity. Supplier 
and purchasing certification processes are governed by specific company procedures (OGs), which ensure the 
timely identification of suppliers and the traceability of supply channels, whic h thus helps guarantee the quality 
and legitimacy of the goods and services purchased.  
Furthermore, all purchasing processes are based on the search for the maximum competitive advantage for 
the MFE Group as well as impartiality and the granting of equal opportunities  towards each supplier who 
meets requirements. 
The preparation of standard contractual texts or those with specific legal issues is assured by the Group’s legal 
department, and by external lawyers where necessary. 
In a bid to make the procurement process more efficient and standardised towards third parties, the MFE Group 
in Italy operates via specialised purchasing centres , whose processes are described in the following 
paragraphs. 
 
45 Art.19 of the Group Code of Ethics. 

Page 162:
 
 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 6 ▪ Community and Territory 
 
158 
In addition, the Group aims to oversee the certification activities of the various categories of suppliers with a 
single organisational unit, thus facilitating the identification of any factors that influence the selection and 
management of the portfolio.  
Given the particular business of the companies in the Group, the main purchase activities of all companies fall into 
three macro areas: 
 Acquisition of broadcasting rights (films, series and sporting events); 
 Acquisition of content (entertainment, news, drama) for the various distribution platforms; 
 Acquisition of goods and services to support television production and cross-production. 
The related procurement processes for each of these areas are described below with evidence of their main 
purchase poles. 
 
ACQUISITION OF RIGHTS 
The MFE Group acquires the following through R.T.I. S.p.A.: serial content (TV series), films (also through the 
subsidiary Medusa), as well as documentaries and sports, depending on the programming needs of free -to-air 
and pay TV. 
These acquisitions are negotiated directly with the owners of the contents or their broadcasting rights.  
The vendor list for the selection of suppliers  is prepared, updated and submitted to the Risk, Control and 
Sustainability Committee every six months, and annually to the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors 
of MFE, in compliance with the corporate organisational guidelines. 
The assessment includes the verification of any ongoing proceedings , such as liquidation, bankruptcy and 
mergers, and also includes the transparency of the corporate chain. 
Furthermore, suppliers resident in countries with preferential taxation entered on the Black List  are not 
considered for the purposes of this selection.  
The selection of suppliers of broadcasting rights takes place through the widespread coverage of the national and 
international content distribution market - while also participating in major sector events - giving preference to 
companies with consolidated experience and expertise: North American majors and minimajors, European 
studios, leading Italian and international independent distributors. 
Special attention is paid to Italian works and is aimed at both current and library works, through the acquisition 
by a Group company of cinematographic works from independent producers, and through commercial 
agreements with companies outside the Group who are specifically dedicated to domestic production. 
The Purchasing Rights Department maintains commercial relations with all the major Italian film distributors, 
through multi-annual volume agreements and prompt procurement. 

Page 163:
 
6 ▪ Community and Territory SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 
 
159 
With regard to multi-annual agreements , the Purchasing Department envisages the purchase not just of 
individual contents, but stipulates "volume" agreements that include varied product categories, based on the 
annual production of the supplier. For this reason, the selection and acquisition of  individual contents are 
conditioned by the contractual terms of the multi-year agreement which define the minimum volumes by product 
type and the methods for selection. There are currently two volume deals, one with W arner and a second with 
Universal. 
As for ad hoc acquisitions, selection is carried out based on the approval of the product by the market, or based 
on the interest stirred by content in countries that are continuously monitored, via information that the suppliers 
send to the Purchasing Department and by assessing t he product directly through the monitoring of satisfaction 
ratings in cinemas, paid channels and streaming networks.  
Once interest has been established for that particular product, “all rights” acquisition usually takes place in order 
to ensure that this is available on different platforms (e.g. Infinity, pay TV and free TV). Given the different needs 
of the platforms, a percentage of the budget is then allocated to exclusive purchases for each of these.  
In 2023, the volume of investments  was €274.1 million, of which 62% for cinema/series/doc broadcasting 
rights and 38% for sports broadcasting rights. 
With respect to the supplier base, 84% of the licensors are Italian or European.  
The following key events occurred in the year: 
 In addition to continuing with the agreements already signed, including the UEFA Champions League, Coppa 
Italia, Italian Open, Formula E and Extreme E and Nations League for the year 2023 as well as various archive 
agreements, the agreement for the America’s Cup was finalised; 
 with regard to films and TV series, the portfolio of content provider partners was consolidated, both with 
respect to US majors and to European and Italian operators; 
 A new Paramount agreement was reached for the years 2023-2024; 
 A new Disney agreement was reached for the years 2023-2024; 
 2023 content use rights under the WarnerMedia and Universal agreements, both already in place; 
 For Infinity+, the “Premiere” agreement with WarnerMedia has been extended and agreements have been 
finalised with international and Italian distributors for the procurement of films; 
 In European production, relations with the major players were consolidated, both for strategic daytime assets, 
such as the new soap La Promesa acquired from StudioCanal, and for new daytime content such as the 
continuation of the soap Bitter Lands from TIMS&B, as well as event content for the early evening slot such as 
the third season of the miniseries Sissi from Beta Film, all premieres; 
 The commitment to documentaries was reinforced with the purchase of 330 hours from a very wide range 
of nearly 40 suppliers; 

Page 164:
 
 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 6 ▪ Community and Territory 
 
160 
 Different agreements were negotiated for the implementation of AVOD series on the Mediaset Infinity 
platform, including: reciprocal broadcasting rights licence between RTI and Mediaset España, purchases of 
Turkish series such as the soap My Home My Destiny by Eccho Rights and “anime” titles, agreement with the 
Serially platform for the distribution of a dedicated branded area; 
 The focus on recent Italian cinema was confirmed, both with respect to films produced within the Group 
and those made by third-party partners; in particular, we highlight the acquisition of the broadcasting rights 
for works distributed by the Medusa Film and Vision Distribution subsidiaries respectively; 
 The commercial relationship with the main Italian independent film distributors and producers  was 
confirmed, such as Eagle Pictures, Lucky Red, Leone Film Group  and Notorious, among others. This 
commitment towards focusing on national products is justified by their greater appeal, especially in prime 
time, compared to international series and films. 
As highlighted previously, part of the investment in film production is made by the subsidiary Medusa Film through 
purchases or co -productions in order to supply the Company with the “product/movie” with the whole 
broadcasting rights chain, starting with cinemas.  
The latter is the starting point for the exploitation of the product life cycle, as well as foundation for the creation 
of value through subsequent exploitation that can be managed by the Group "non-exclusively" (for example from 
market practice, TV on demand, pay per view) or "exclusively" (SVOD, free).  
Also, constant market monitoring is carried out on film content to identify the main trends and products of 
interest (at international and local level) and to gather useful information in general to guide the broadcast 
offering. 
The movie rights acquired in 2023 come from Italian producers, since the publishing line established by the Group 
for Medusa envisages a focus on Italian cinema, typically comedy. In 2023, given the strategic business objective 
of Medusa, the "core" suppli ers were predominantly Italian. These suppliers, as executive producers or original 
producers, have an almost entirely Italian supply chain. Film shooting and all subsequent post -production 
processes take place in Italy.  
The close relations between Medusa Film and Italian cinema is a guarantee for the selection, production and 
dissemination of the best product, given the constant commitment of the Medusa Film and its suppliers to 
enhancing local artistic and professional excellence. This commitment must always be guaranteed to the highest 
standards in the industry in order to withstand competition from foreign products. 
Lastly, note that the Organisational Guideline  on “Planning, acquisition and management of movie 
rights” states that supply contracts for the purchase of film rights from Italian counterparties must contain clauses 
that demand suppliers obtain approval for public programming. In the event of non -fulfilment of this clause, 
Medusa Film has the right to withdra w from the existing contract without jeopardy to any possible claims for 
damages or, alternatively, to apply further specific clauses (for example the reduction of the fee). 
In the event of acquisition of movie rights by foreign counterparties, the contracts drawn up must contain clauses 
that provide for Medusa Film’s right to make the cuts necessary to obtain approval for public programming, with 
prior approval of the supplier.

ACQUISITION OF CONTENT 
Entertainment - The creation of entertainment programmes requires the acquisition of formats, the signing of 
executive contracts and the contracting of artistic resources and collaborators. 
Suppliers are selected on the basis of the television broadcasting guidelines and the purchasing requirements plan 
defined by Programme Schedule and Distribution General Management in collaboration with the Entertainment 
Department.  
The Entertainment Department selects broadcasting projects of interest and manages negotiations with the 
supplier. At the same time, the Legal Affairs Department carries out preliminary checks to ascertain the effective 
ownership of the broadcasting rights (brand/titles) granted by t he selected supplier and the usability of the 
proposed titles.  
The Provider Certification Department of the Procurement Division  is responsible for carrying out the 
accreditation and preliminary qualification of suppliers.  
The management of the process of contracting out television productions and acquiring formats and licences must 
be carried out in compliance with applicable national, European and/or international rules and regulations in 
force, with particular reference to offences remotely relevant for the purposes of Legislative Decree 231/01. 
In contracting out television productions and purchasing formats and licences, the Entertainment Department 
operates according to the principles of lawfulness, fairness and propriety expressed in the Code of Ethics, paying 
particular attention to the provisions on conflicts of interest contained therein.  
When commencing collaboration with a new supplier, the accreditation and certification process is managed by 
the Procurement Division through the dedicated department. 
The Entertainment Department informs the relevant Purchasing Hub of the qualitative and quantitative targets for 
the television product to be purchased/produced.  
At contractual level: 
- there is a specific clause on guarantees and adherence to the Code of Ethics and compliance programme; 
- there is a general ban on subcontracting, and where subcontracting takes place, certification of subcontractors 
is required. 
The following obligations in terms of contractual clauses are also provided for: 
- compliance with the provisions of the law in force on contributions and health and safety in the workplace 
pursuant to Legislative Decree 81/2008, as well as an indemnity in favour of R.T.I. with regard to all the obligations 
necessary for this purpose;  
- compliance with the obligations laid down in current legislation on the employment of staff who are non-EU 
nationals; 
- compliance with current environmental regulations. 

Page 166:
 
 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 6 ▪ Community and Territory 
 
162 
Starting from 2021, a clause directed towards verifying the supplier’s obligations in relation to tax and social 
security was also added. 
Suppliers are always chosen with analysis of sourcing models that make best use of internal structures and skills. 
About half of the suppliers/collaborators dedicated to entertainment content production are studios and/or 
agencies from across Italy, particularly around Rome and Milan, which ensure the services of actors, 
documentalists, directors, costume designers, se t designers, directors of photography, choreographers, 
commentators, hosts or guests. The Entertainment and Music Business Affairs Department (for non -VIPs) and 
Artistic Resources Department (for VIPs) provide for the research and stipulation of contracts with the various 
artistic resources employed by the various Group companies. In 2023, the Entertainment and Music Business 
Affairs Department managed approximately 600 contracts relating to procurement, licensing and supply of 
services. With regard to artistic collaborations in the entertainment area, it finalised 16,481 contracts, plus 868 
in the music sector. 
In 2023, the Artistic Resources Department concluded 6,371 contracts for a total of 947 collaborators (including 
hosts, commentators, guests, reporters also in the News, Sport, Digital and Radio areas), continuing with action 
to contain costs and optimise performance. 
Of these, about 35 are annual and/or long-term contracts relating to strategic artistic resources (the main faces 
linked to the most important broadcasting products in the programme schedule). 
NEWS 
The Hard News area is based on Tg5 and Tgcom24, while infotainment productions are handled by Videonews.  
News - The category of suppliers for News Rights (transfer or acquisition of TV and internet rights) for material – 
videos and photos – of regional news, news, entertainment, and international are mostly Italian with the rest from 
European or non -European countries. These are small or medium -sized suppliers in most cases but also major 
suppliers (e.g. national and international press and video agencies). With regard to the purchase of strategic 
sports broadcasting rights, the management makes use of the purchasing centres headed by Mediaset (Sports 
Rights Acquisition Management) which participates in the calls arranged by events organisers/suppliers. The other 
purchases are followed by the same structures with the same logic as the news management.  
  

Page 167:
 
6 ▪ Community and Territory SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 
 
163 
The supply chain consists of collaborations with the following professional skills: 
 Journalists;  
 Documentalists; 
 Directors and authors; 
 Casting organiser; 
 Costume designers, second costume designers, make-
up artists, hairdressers; 
 Graphic designers; 
 Speakers, graphic designers and studio animators; 
 Supply of public, participants, hostesses and 
stewards; 
 Contracts to companies for various supplies such as 
graphic support, translation services and surveys. 
In addition to these collaborations, the News area purchases licences for technical materials of various types, 
as well as regional suppliers of materials and lastly part of the purchases goes to press and video agencies.  
Selection of suppliers, both for content and collaboration, is determined based on the broadcast needs of the 
programme, assessing the professional characteristics and experience of the collaborators. 
Drama - The drama products featured in the MFE Group’s broadcast offering are created through the use of 
independent third-party productions; this activity generated around 80 hours of finished product  over the 
whole of 2023, mainly for early evening slot programming on Canale 5.  
The selection of independent producers is fundamentally based on the projects selected by the broadcaster. The 
broadcaster decides based on the broadcasting potential of the identified product, or on the congruence between 
the project examined and the broadcasting line of the Group.  
Historically, drama productions are solely Italian in origin. 
Furthermore, remaining on the topic of changes in the supply chain, it should be noted that the contractual 
template predominantly used in the past, or the contracting template , has gradually been replaced by 
templates of co -production and pre -purchase due to the new legislation on tax credits for audiovisual 
production, thus entering a residual category.  
Digital - Acquisitions and investments provided by the Digital area of the Group focus on the following macro-
areas:  
 acquisitions in the development of technological products;  
 investments in the production of contents;  
 investments to promote the distribution of content produced internally by MFE agencies and productions. 
The total number of suppliers involved throughout the year for the various activities is about 192, mainly resident 
in Italy, while some are from the United States, UK and other EU countries. 

Page 168:
 
 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 6 ▪ Community and Territory 
 
164 
Given the speed of changes the digital sector is particularly prone to, selection of suppliers is always up to 
whichever partner companies demonstrate a marked predisposition to technological and product innovation. 
Radio - The core activity of the MFE Group’s radio hub consists in the production and issue of entertainment 
content and musical flows aimed at Italian radio listeners.  
For the conduct of its business, it mainly relies on the service provided by speakers, hosts and authors employed 
for the creation and management of the programming schedule on broadcasters 105, Virgin Radio, R101, RMC 
and Radio Subasio. 
These include 160 Italian freelancers, most of whom are known within the radio and television scene. 
Most collaborators are Italian, but a limited number of foreign resources are also contracted.  
The main radio content is Italian and foreign music, which is indirectly acquired from the record companies, 
with repayment of broadcasting rights via collecting companies specifically appointed for this purpose (SIAE, 
SCF, etc.). 
The programming schedule produced and distributed by the broadcasters is "marketed" by the advertising sales 
house Digitalia ‘08 S.p.A., appointed on a national level by virtue of specific advertising concession agreements 
through the sale of space (commercials, mentions, etc.) to third-party investors.  
The actual selection of suppliers takes place, first of all, through constant market monitoring  and careful 
assessment of company needs, and their reliability is certified through a continuous accreditation process46. 
Offers are made, suppliers selected and services contracted according to the needs identified.  
In the artistic field (mainly for speakers, hosts and guests), where each broadcaster uses different resources 
depending on the specificity of the radio business, target listeners and audience response, the main factors for 
the selection are the individual characteristics of each artist. More generally, the direction followed would be to 
make the selection both using the criteria for the dynamics of the competitive scenarios in which broadcasters act, 
and also via the parameters of adequacy and consistency of remuneration/contribution with the market prices of 
that particular professional category.  
In addition to broadcasting and creative activities , there are also technical activities (low frequency and 
control room, carried out by employees) and the distribution of the national signal (high frequency) through 
stations (equipment and pylons) and radio relays spread over all regions of Italy. The maintenance of the stations 
(1838 between Radio Studio 105 S.p.A., Virgin Radio Italy S.p.A., RMC Italia S.p.A., Monradio Srl, Radio Subasio 
Srl and Radio Aut Srl) and of the transmission equipment is entrust ed to external professional maintenance 
technicians (local suppliers), a total of 86 maintenance companies. In addition to these maintenance service 
providers there are lessors who lease out the stations, a total of 265. 
 
46All suppliers are selected in compliance with the laws and regulations in force, such as Legislative Decree 231 and 81/08 and the ethical principles of the Group.

PROCUREMENT OF GOODS AND SERVICES 
The procurement processes of products and services supporting cross-operational activities refer to the following 
supply categories: 
 Systems and technologies  
 General services - facility / cross-functional 
 TV production 
The Group in Italy operates exclusively with accredited third-party suppliers registered on the Vendor list , 
checking preliminary details (company name, country of residence, address, etc.), overall corporate transparency 
(identification of the final beneficial owner), the level of concentration of revenues (monitoring whether this 
exceeds 50% threshold for a single customer), and th e absence of pending issues concerning both the company 
and representatives connected with it. 
Also, for the year 2023  – despite the critical issues and difficulties connected with the international economic 
repercussions of war – the effort to streamline the supplier accreditation process continued, which involves 
greater and more in-depth checks on active suppliers, such as, for example, the questionnaire to verify the level 
of security suppliers offer in handling data exchanged with the Group (Cyber Security, in collaboration with the 
Technology Department). 
Furthermore, the use of the monitoring system for risks associated with suppliers  (Third Party Risk 
Management - TPRM) has been consolidated. Through analysis of various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), 
grouped consistently in different risk areas, this allows Supplier Certification and Risk, in collaboration with the 
Category Manage rs, to maintain constant attention over time to the various risks borne by suppliers and 
appropriate actions to be taken to mitigate the risk itself. 
The structured management process for subcontracts tracked and managed on the Synertrade platform has 
been consolidated further by optimising document management. 
Further rationalisation of the supply chain was carried out based on critical issues linked to expenditure, the 
regulatory complexity of the merchandise sector involved in the commercial relationship (e.g. suppliers that 
provide additional legal obligations), the type of contract (e.g. subcontract)  and according to the employment of 
personnel (employees or direct contractors of the supplier or staff of third parties to whom the service is 
subcontracted). 
Given the positive results obtained with the pilot ESG project  (definition of the evaluation questionnaire, 
implementation planning process and evaluation of the results), launched in the second half of 2022, the panel of 
suppliers subject to ESG assessment was expanded with the same premises in 2023, involving around a hundred 
active suppliers, chosen from among those most relevant from a business perspective and with the product 
categories most at risk. 
Analysis of the results obtained allowed us to launch an even broader supplier evaluation and involvement 
programme, to be implemented in 2024, for both Italian and Spanish MFE suppliers. 

Page 170:
 
 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 6 ▪ Community and Territory 
 
166 
The general goal is to make MFE suppliers aware of the importance of environmental, social and governance 
issues to the Group and, consequently, to the entire supply chain (scope 3), tending over time towards a 
homogeneous ecosystem, through shared action to improve.  
Use of the Vendor Rating has also been consolidated, also used to select the parties to be invited to tender and 
for the renewal of contracts of significant amounts. 
In addition to the contractually required documentation, upon request when necessary, MFE has the right to 
request self-certification from the supplier, signed by the legal representative, for contracts involving work services 
(contracts) stating that the personnel employed in rendering the services are regularly hired, paid and insured, 
and ensuring compliance and correct fulfilment of all legal obligations regarding worker protection. 
Lastly, the management of these processes aims to implement a gradual turnover of suppliers  in order to 
diversify total expenditure over several parties, thus reducing their concentration and diversifying their risks. 
MFE has also established that all suppliers must complete all registration phases including acceptance of the terms 
and conditions for using the platform, the privacy rules, the Group Code of Ethics and the Compliance Programme 
in order to be classified in the portal dedicated to them. 
In the management of its supply chain, the MFE Group in Spain  promotes responsible practices within its 
sphere of influence by transmitting environmental, social and ethical standards  to its supply chain. Since 
2010, contracts with suppliers to the MFE group in Spain have contained a clause that establishes their 
commitment to respecting basic principles of sustainability, namely: respecting workers' rights and union 
membership, refraining from using child labour, refusing any kind of slave labour, prohibiting any kind of 
discrimination, complying with the legislation on the prevention of risks at work, ensuring the safety of employees 
during working hours and prohibiting any conduct involving corruption, blackmail or extortion.  
The contractors also declare that they comply with environmental regulations and promote the efficient use of 
limited resources such as energy, water and raw materials in the course of their activities. In this way, suppliers 
declare their commitment to ethical and responsible management. 
With regard to the types of suppliers and the main items of expenditure relating to the MFE Group in Spain, there 
is a greater concentration in the purchase of television broadcasting rights and content, 26.6%, followed by 
technological, professional and production services, which together account for around 24.3%.  
Technological services contracted are linked to the purchase of technical materials (essentially hardware, 
software, cameras, mixers, matrices, audio and video equipment). 
Professional services consist mainly of maintenance and development of computer applications and consultancy 
and audit services.  
Production services mainly refer to services of set design, lighting and subtitles.  
Contracts with national suppliers cover the vast majority of goods and services purchases, where international 
suppliers correspond mainly to the negotiation of technological services.

6.2  THE SOCIAL IMPACT OF THE GROUP 
ADVANCED TRAINING INITIATIVES  
The MFE Group education programmes for people outside the Company, in order to develop skills linked with the 
world of commercial TV, continued in 2023 as in earlier years.  
There was consolidation of the collaboration between IULM University and Mediaset to organise and manage 
the Master’s in Journalism. 
Thanks to careful selection and excellent training, the Master’s introduces students to a career as a professional 
journalist. IULM and Mediaset combine their respective expertise in the world of communication and information. 
The professional training course is recognised by the National Association of Journalists for the purposes of 
an apprenticeship (18 months). 
The Master’s course aims to equip young journalists with the professional skills that will enable them to access all 
broadcasting markets and produce multimedia content for the various platforms. The effectiveness of the courses 
is validated by the Joint Scientific Committee (IULM, Mediaset, National Association of Journalists). 
There is also a technology workshop run using professionals made available by the Group. It stands out among 
Italian journalism courses as the only one of its kind. 
In 2023, 6 students from the IULM Master’s in Journalism were hosted on internships in Mediaset’s agencies (TV, 
web, mobile), between September and October. 
In addition to the internships that took place as part of the IULM Master’s in Journalism, the company 
collaborates with several journalism schools all over the country (Università Cattolica, Università Statale di 
Milano IFG, Università di Torino - Giorgio Bocca master’s, Università di Bologna - master’s in journalism, Università 
di Bari - master’s in journalism, LUMSA, LUISS, Napoli Suor Orsola Benincasa) and in 2023 it offered 27 students 
the possibility of an internship. 
The MFE Group also offers its experience and professionalism via the Master’s in Marketing, Digital 
Communication and Sales Management, which was established in 1988 by Publitalia’80. 
The Master's in Marketing, Digital Communication and Sales Management is a 13-month postgraduate course with 
lectures and internship and limited admission, targeted at graduates who have decided to start their professional 
future in the field of marketing, trade marketing, sales and digital communications. 
Through the two editions launched in 2023 (January-May and September-December), the Master's offered its 60 
participants 170 course days for a total of 1,190 hours of training; with reference to the January-May 2023 edition, 
the 28 participants were able to approach the world of work through participation in a total of 140 days of 
internship, a total of 1,120 hours, at the end of which all graduates were able to find permanent job positions. 
The companies that collaborate on this initiative contribute with teaching and practical sessions and provide a 
reference point for the labour market as an employer, as well as elements that enable the ongoing updating of the

training programme. As a result, the Master's course always acts as an up -to-date "bridge" between Universities 
and the Company. 
This takes place thanks to teaching staff from leading Italian and international universities  and 
contributions from managers in key roles within Italian and multinational companies. 
the Master’s is the  longest-running experiment in collaboration between Milanese  universities. From the 
beginning of the initiative, the Rectors of six Milanese universities signed up to it, taking part in the Chairpersons’ 
Committee:  
 Università Commerciale L. Bocconi 
 Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore 
 IULM Libera Università di Lingue e Comunicazione 
 Politecnico di Milano 
 Università degli Studi di Milano 
 University of Milan -Bicocca, and were joined by the main local associations and representatives of the 
financial and business world. 
The Master’s, now in its thirty-sixth edition, has to date educated more than 1,000 graduates, many of whom 
now hold top management positions. 
The course is accredited by ASFOR, the Italian Association for Management Education, as a specialist Master’s 
course.  
Furthermore, the MFE Group has had ongoing collaborations with leading Italian universities for some years 
now, offering students of the main faculties opportunities for integrated curricular internships to complete their 
studies. During their internship experience, the young undergraduates are given the opportunity to experience 
the world of work while building professional relationships, interfacing with the organisational dynamics of the 
company and using the knowledge acquired during their studies to fu rther hone the skills and experiences that 
will facilitate their entry into the labour market. 
Scuola dei Mestieri 
In 2023, the joint project between Operations Management and the Human Resources Department launched in 
2022 continued, directed towards offering a professional training course to young graduates in the television 
production sector. 
The "Scuola dei Mestieri" (School of Trades) project was conceived as a tool to enable professional know-how 
to be handed down to future generations by capitalising on more senior figures involved as "master 
tradespeople", in a period characterised by a high age-related turnover within the Company, and in the technical 
and production areas in particular. 
The project, which in 2023 involved 44 students , takes place at the Rome production centres through an 

Page 173:

169 
agreement with the Istituto di Istruzione Superiore Cine-Tv Roberto Rossellini, while in Cologno Monzese a similar 
initiative is in place with the Scuola Civica di Cinema Luchino Visconti. These courses include a frontal training 
stage in the classroom for the school students, followed by a period  of internship in the company, which allows 
them to experience the different jobs within production centres (camera operator, motion graphic designer, video 
mixer, audio mixer, production optimiser) in the field. 
Thanks to this project, the company intends to capitalise on the experience acquired by its own resources, looking 
to the future by investing in young people who, after the internship course, can also represent an important pool 
for supporting generational transition. 
INITIATIVES AIMED AT THE COMMUNITY 
MFE Group agencies receive daily information on philanthropic activities, events and initiatives by non -profit 
organisations and charitable associations for the protection and support of ethnic minorities, voluntary groups, 
and institutions of medical research. 
In addition to this and given the Group’s desire to 
put its communicative power and the skills of its 
collaborators at the service of the community, the 
“Mediaset ha a cuore il futuro” initiative was 
launched in September 2019: communication campaigns that operate according to an integrated multimedia 
scheme featuring TV and radio as well as digital and social media coverage give visibility to issues of national 
importance.  
The numerous awareness -raising and exposé campaigns involve a strong media response on all the Group’s 
generalist and thematic networks: self-produced commercials are accompanied by TV news reports, spaces within 
information, infotainment and entertainment broadcasts, programmes within the TV and radio schedules, quotes 
and detailed information on websites and social media channels, together with other social initiatives. 
During 2023, there were eight campaigns: 
 
Invito alla lettura (“Invitation to read” from 19 to 26 
February). The campaign invites families to promote 
reading as a good personal growth habit for young 
children, so they become happier adults who are 
better prepared for the future. The spot was filmed on 
24 March, for World Book Day.

Siamo fatti di acqua. Diamole ogni goccia 
d’amore (“We are made of water. Let's give her every 
drop of love“ 21 and 22 March). On the occasion of 
World Water Day, an event established by the United 
Nations in 1992, Mediaset celebrates with a spot 
inviting the public to take care of an essential 
resource that tends to be wasted. 
  
 
 
 
La terra dei nostri figli è nelle nostre mani. 
Trattiamola con cura (“The land of our children is in 
our hands. Let's treat it with care” 21 and 22 April). 
Mediaset supports Earth Day with a cross -media 
campaign that invites people to treat the resources of 
the planet, which we will leave to the coming 
generation, with care through small daily actions 
based on recycling, saving and sustainable mobility. 
 
 
 
Viaggiare in Italia, un segno d’amore (“Travelling 
in Italy, a sign of love” from 7 to 13 May). The 
company puts its name to a campaign inviting the 
public to promote Italy and consciously visit the 
country, leaving a positive trace of their passage.  
 
 
 
 


Page 175:

Occhio ai dati, ragazzi! (“Watch the data, guys !” 
from 16 July to 7 August). The campaign, which was 
created as a sign of the commitment made in 2022, in 
signing the Pietrarsa Manifesto, consists of three 
different spots to raise awareness of the value of the 
data disseminated on the internet among young 
people and their families. The spot features people 
aged 7 to 13, who took part in a focus group about 
privacy, personal data and security on the internet. 
 
Prenditi un momento, fai prevenzione (“Take a 
moment, do prevention” from 22 to 29 October). Now 
in its fifth edition, has always been dedicated to 
breast cancer prevention. It consists of a spot, which 
highlights the importance of early diagnosis, to 
effectively counteract the effects of the disease. As in 
previous editions, the Mediaset Tower turned pink, to 
symbolise the company’s commitment to breast 
cancer prevention. 
 
 
 
The campaign to support the International Day 
for the Elimination of Violence against Women  
(from 23 to 26 November). The campaign, comprising 
three different spots, invites the public to become 
involved in the problem of gender-based violence and 
to report violence of which they are victims or 
witnesses, to the anti -violence and anti -stalking 
number 1522. Artistic projects by Italian female 
photographers exploring the gender -based violence 
emergency were also lent visibility to support this 
edition.

Le persone non sono la loro disabilità. Cambiamo punto di 
vista sulle differenze (“People are not their disability. Let's 
change our point of view on the differences” from 2 to 7 December). 
The initiative, created to celebrate the International Day of Persons 
with Disabilities, aims to show how the day of people with 
disabilities could be without the constraints that they imply.  
 
 
On the web, a page dedicated to these projects was developed within the MediasetInfinity site. In addition to 
gathering together all the material produced for the campaigns in chronological order, the aim of the dedicated 
space is to publicise brand -new contributions and in -depth information produced specifically for every topic 
focused on. It’s a genuine archive, always up to date and open to consultation, so that the contemporary nature 
of the problems addressed remains present. 
At the same time, a page dedicated to the claim “Mediaset ha a cuore il futuro” (Mediaset cares about the future) 
was activated on Facebook and Instagram in January 2023. It supports and amplifies the message conveyed, thanks 
to the communicative power of social media. Specific content and exclusive campaigns are published on these 
pages, including “World Mental Health Day”, which was created to celebrate the 10 October anniversary and 
condemn prejudices related to psychotherapy and has achieved significant results in terms of visibility. 
But “Mediaset ha a cuore il futuro” is more than a system for raising awareness of broad-ranging national issues. 
It also involves concrete action for sustainability within the company. For example, raising the awareness of 
employees so that they save ener gy more carefully at home and in the office through advice published on the 
home page of the company Intranet and shown on video walls placed in the shared areas of the Campus. 
This is because “caring about the future” isn’t merely a catchphrase but a way of existing, thinking and acting. 
When talking about social initiatives for the community, mention must be made of the satirical programme Striscia 
la Notizia, which always follows the issue of sustainability closely. 
The programme promotes initiatives to protect the environment, through the reports in the Ambiente Giovani 
slot (in which very young ‘scientific advisors’ deal with activities or associations dedicated to protecting the 
environment) and food production, artisanal and organic, in the “Paesi, paesaggi...” and Speranza Verde slots 
by Davide Rampello and Luca Sardella respectively. The show has always been engaged in exposé, such as Stefania 
Petyx’s reports on open dumps or arson in Sicily; there is also the weekly slot with Luca Galtieri’s waste -fighting 
tour, in which the re porter involves students and teaching s taff at hotel schools throughout Italy in preparing 
dishes made with leftovers. 
Finally, the consolidated partnership between Striscia la Notizia and the F.A.I. (Italian Environment Fund) in the 


Page 177:
 
6 ▪ Community and Territory SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 
 
173 
protection, preservation and enhancement of the Italian artistic and natural heritage is extremely important. 
Radio too plays an important role in social initiatives directed towards the community. 
In 2023 Radio 105, together with Regional Trenitalia, supported the activity of the Plastic Free non -profit. 184 
cleanups, from North to South, promoted on air, online on board Trenitalia regional trains, with the “105 Save the 
Sea” awareness-raising campaign. For five Sundays in July, five Radio 105 speakers took part in the cleanups 
personally, sharing their experience through social media, radio and TV channels together with the passion and 
determination of the plastic-free volunteers. 4,520 people participated over the whole of July, removing 35,277 kg 
of plastic and waste from the environment: a major commitment to promoting the inclusiveness of human 
habitation, protecting the environment, biodiversity and ecosystems present in the area.  
R101, on the other hand, was the Radio Partner of the “Pigiama Run” in 2023, the race of the Italian Anti -Cancer 
League that has everyone wearing pyjamas in solidarity with people who have to wear them every day due to long 
hospital stays, that is, young cancer patients. 
On the web, a page dedicated to these projects was developed within the Mediaset Infinity site. In addition to 
gathering together all the material produced for the campaigns in chronological order, the aim of the dedicated 
space is to publicise brand -new contributions and in -depth information produced specifically for every topic 
focused on. I t’s a genuine archive, always up to date and open to consultation at any time, so that the 
contemporary nature of the problems addressed remains present. 
We also wish to stress that sponsorship of fundraisers for public and private bodies (recognised by the state) 
is all certified by government associations (Civil Protection for Italy and AGIRE for the world). Many of these 
activities are also carried out through the support of Mediafriends, a non-profit organisation founded in 2003 as a 
tangible expression of the Company’s vision of corporate social responsibility.  
It is within this scenario that the Group takes to the field alongside Mediafriends and Fabbrica del Sorriso  
through its own agencies, in daytime packages on generalist networks or on TGCom24. Particular visibility is given 
to the projects to which Fabbrica del Sorriso is committed, not only upon presentation and during fundraising but 
also when the project is run and for the results from the initiative.  
The " Tg dei Ragazzi ", in collaboration with " la Città dei Bambini e dei Ragazzi " in Genoa, is another TGCom24 
educational partnership initiative to have been given visibility. 
Publitalia'80 contributes to the social activities of the MFE Group through Mediafriends, providing advertising 
space that is used to promote fundraising mainly to support the identified charity initiatives. In addition to this, 
Publitalia'80 reserves some advertising space to initiatives that support scientific research, training and cultural 
activities. 
During the year, about 5,642 spots were broadcast related to social campaigns. 
Publitalia ‘80 is a founding member of the Fondazione Pubblicità Progresso, along with the major players in 
communication in Italy. This foundation aims to contribute to solving the civil, educational and moral problems of 
the community by placing communication at the service of society. 

Page 178:
 
 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 6 ▪ Community and Territory 
 
174 
In addition to paying a membership fee, the sponsoring members provide their work free of charge for the 
implementation of the Foundation's activities. 
Pubblicità Progresso promotes training initiatives on social communication at leading Italian universities; it 
promotes events, exhibitions and initiatives dedicated to important social issues; it sponsors social communication 
campaigns carried out by non -profit organisations; and it holds the festival of social communication for training 
and public educational purposes.  
Every year, Pubblicità Progresso draws the attention of the authorities and public opinion to create greater 
awareness on a specific theme by implementing communication campaigns using contributions from promoting 
partners: campaigns on anti -smoking, organ  donation, gender equality, anti -racism, sustainability, volunteer 
work, etc.  
The Group's radio stations broadcast socially themed spots free of charge. This activity comes under the sub -
concession contract in force between Radiomediaset, Monradio and Subasio and the Mediamond sales house. 
 
Activities to support youth entrepreneurship 
Also for 2023, AD4Ventures, the MFE venture capital  project, confirmed its commitment to Italian youth 
entrepreneurship and, more generally, to choosing companies with a strong focus on sustainability.  
The investment model involves taking stakes in digital startups in the consumer and retail areas, medium -sized 
and with high growth potential, through advertising campaigns in Italy and Spain in all Group media, TV, radio and 
digital properties. 
The investment portfolio also extends beyond national borders provided that the companies have operations in 
the country.  
With growth in reputation built up over the years, AD4Ventures has become an important reference point for every 
youth entrepreneurial concern not yet able to commit great economic resources to developing marketing 
campaigns. Beyond that, collaboration with institutions such as Fondo Italiano d’Investimento and CDP, fully active 
since 2022, now represents great legitimacy of its activity within the Italian entrepreneurial system. 
In the difficult year of 2023, characterised by a major contraction in investments at European level, the 
AD4Ventures strategy was to strengthen its portfolio through a series of important follow-on investments: among 
these, the additional interventions in the Therapyside (TherapyChat rebranded), Impress and Pascol companies 
directed towards accelerating their growth have a significance that deserves mention. 
Despite a particularly complicated year for the venture world however, there was no shortage of new projects: at 
the end of 2023 Ad4Ventures invested in Faba, an audio device that lets children listen to stories, songs, fairy tales 
and nursery rhymes. It’s a genuine educational tool that can bring children closer to reading and listening. The 
company, founded in 2019, has a presence in 8 countries with 1,500 active sales outlets in Europe and has already 
seen strong growth in Italy after the initial TV and radio campaign phase on Mediaset channels.  
Investing in Faba is in line with the great attention Ad4Ventures has always paid to ESG when choosing projects 

Page 179:
 
6 ▪ Community and Territory SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 
 
175 
for investment: in this case the area of reference is Quality Education for better and healthier childhood learning.  
More generally, the portfolio at the end of 2023 includes 9 start-ups all with activities in Italy, founded between 
2010 and 2019 and with a management that remains young (just over 30).  
Year by year, the Ad4Ventures business model (advertising in exchange for minority shares) means that it has 
become an essential reference point for every youth entrepreneurial concern for which access to major media (TV 
but also radio) is difficult or unattainable. It represents a concrete means of using the great communicative power 
of the Mediaset world to act as an amplifier for young, independent concerns with great potential.  
 
The commitment of MFE in Spain to social welfare  is reflected in the 12 Meses  project. Over 2023, its 
activities were directed mainly towards the most vulnerable groups in society (such as children), equality in every 
area and protecting the environment. 
We would also highlight initiatives to promote the circular economy and women’s rights as well as aid to the 
Ukrainian refugee population and support for the activities of the Spanish Federation of Food Banks. 
This prevention and information activity was also made possible thanks to continuous exchange of ideas and 
opinions with various associations and non-profit organisations. 
We would also highlight the creation of the “Valor Mediaset” brand in 2020, which aims to involve the most 
important advertising investors in Corporate Social Responsibility campaigns. These initiatives continued into 
2023. 
During 2023, the MFE Group in Spain supported and gave media coverage to the following initiatives: 
 World Cancer Research Day 
 World Bladder Cancer Day 


Page 180:
 
 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 6 ▪ Community and Territory 
 
176 
 International Childhood Cancer Research Day 
 World Breast Cancer Day. 
Finally, in 2023 Mediaset España guaranteed free advertising space for NGOs amounting to an estimated value 
of 5,6 million euros. 
MEDIAFRIENDS 
Mediafriends Onlus , a Non -Profit Organisation (NPO), was established on June 18, 2003 by Reti Televisive 
italiane S.p.A., Arnoldo Mondadori Editore S.p.A. and Medusa Film S.p.A. 
We would highlight that in compliance with Legislative Decree 
no. 117 of 3 July 2017, as amended (hereinafter Third Sector 
Code or CTS), which implements the delegation for the reform 
of the third sector contained in Law no. 106 of 6 June 2016, 
Mediafriends has undertaken the revision of its Bylaws in 
order to implement the provisions of the Third Sector Code 
updated with the amendments made by the corrective 
Legislative Decree 105/2018.  
In accordance with and on the basis of, the provisions of the Third Sector Code and decrees and provisions issued 
to enact it, Mediafriends amended its bylaws in an extraordinary shareholders’ meeting on 30 June 2022. The new 
bylaws also involve changing the name name from “Mediafriends Onlus” to “Mediafriends Ente Filantropico” (an 
ente filantropico being one of the typical third sector bodies envisaged by the CTS): these, as well as the new name, 
will be effective from the registration of Mediafriends in the Single Third Sector Register (RUNTS). As the CTS 
and current legislation allow for non -profit organisations, Mediafriends will register in the RUNTS with the new 
bylaws indicated above and new name by 31 March following the tax year of EC authorisation pursuant to art. 101 
paragraph 10 of the CTS and with effect from the tax year immediately after that, maintaining registration in the 
register of non-profit organisations and the resulting tax consequences until such time.  
Mediafriends is a tangible expression of the MFE Group’s vision of corporate social responsibility. The association 
focuses exclusively on achieving social solidarity and does not distribute, even indirectly, profits and advances 
or any funds, savings and capital throughout the duration of the Company’s existence, unless the destination or 
distribution are required by law or are donations by Mediafriends in favour of o ther non-profit organisations 
which, by bylaws or regulations, are part of the same unitar y structure; it uses profits or advances to perform 
institutional activities and anything else directly connected to them.  
Mediafriends Onlus carries out the conception, planning, realisation and promotion of events , to collect 
resources with the ultimate goal of financing targeted projects in the following sectors:  
 Social, health and socio-health assistance; 
 Charities;  


Page 181:
 
6 ▪ Community and Territory SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 
 
177 
 Education and training;  
 Protection, promotion and enhancement of culture, art and things of artistic and historical interest;  
 Protection and enhancement of the environment;  
 International cooperation. 
Mediafriends is responsible for identifying and promoting opportunities for exchange between the world 
of business and the third sector, in order to promote mutual growth and the well-being of society. It also aims 
to better coordinate communication skills and deepen relations in the world of entertainment and culture in order 
to raise public awareness and solicit donations to fund targeted projects by third sector NGOs. 
The process of identifying the Associations and projects to be supported through fundraising activities includes a 
series of steps, starting from the identification of a theme chosen among those envisaged by the Bylaws and 
of one or more Associations that have projects in progress and meet the budget, diligence and transparency 
requirements, verified through MFE’s Supplier Certification Office. 
The second step involves analysis of the project estimates  provided by the Association through adequacy 
analysis of the costs presented. At this point, if the evaluation criteria are positive, a contract is drafted between 
the Association and Mediafriends, which regulates the mutual obligations during the fundraising period and 
afterwards when Mediafriends checks the implementation of the project, in accordance with the provisions of the 
contract itself. Starting from 2018, with the advent of the new “Self-regulation code for the management of 
numbers used for telephone fundraising for socially beneficial purposes”, which provides for fixed and 
variable costs for each campaign, Mediafriends has redesigned the way it operates in fundraising campaigns and 
has introduced a new method, in addition to the one just described, whereby when fundraising for an Association 
the latter collects the money directly while Mediafriends only provides support and communication campaigns.  
The Association is in any case obliged to provide Mediafriends with due notification and reporting of the proceeds. 
In the first case, usually followed over the years, the Bylaws state that the money raised by Mediafriends will be 
allocated to the Association through the Mediafriends Advisory Committee, with three positions expressed by 
the Members of Mediafriends, by Mediafriends and by a representative of the Association. The Advisory 
Committee authorises the disbursement the funds raised, indicating the time frames and methods.  
Mediafriends then checks the reports  from the Association and monitors the progress of the project 
funded. However, according to the above -mentioned new method, Mediafriends still maintains the obligations 
of the beneficiary Association to report the proceeds as described above. 
Over the years, Mediafriends has supported numerous TV and other events to raise funds for the projects of non-
profit associations. The most notable of these is Fabbrica del sorriso (the smile factory). At 31 December 2023, 
over 80 million euros have been raised and distributed, allowing 185 associations to implement 312 charity 
projects in Italy and around the world. 
To do this, Mediafriends called on close collaboration with the MFE Group. Mediafriends also relies on the 
continuous work of 5 Group employees, who design events and coordinate with both external bodies (third sector, 

Page 182:
 
 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 6 ▪ Community and Territory 
 
178 
institutions, etc.) and with the departments within the company. 
Fundraising initiatives and activities follow one after another throughout the year: fundraising events, field 
initiatives in collaboration with recipient groups and broadcasting events. 
These events were promoted on television and on the web, with the collaboration of the various structures of the 
Group: the presentation of programme projects with services created by journalists in the News Department, 
fundraising spaces with commercials created by the Creative Department, presence in programmes with the 
collaboration of the production structures of the Entertainment, News, Sport and Publitalia'80 Departments.  
Finally, the Mediafriends website, which during 2022 has undergone extensive graphic restyling and had its 
content updated, the Mediafriends section of the TGCOM24 website and the Fabbrica del Sorriso Facebook 
page contain the associations’ campaigns and many videos, made concerning the most important social issues. 
2023 began with the fundraising event Per i bambini 
Ucraini (for Ukrainian children), launched by 
Mediafriends on 25 December 2022 with two NGOs, 
Intersos and Soleterre, which have been present and 
helping children in Ukraine for years. In the first year of the 
war, they had to face winter without food, water, hea ting 
and shelter. The Mediafriends initiative, which ended on 
25 February, benefited from a campaign of 240 spots, 
involved many television productions with dedicated 
appeals within Mediaset broadc asts, and was supported 
by the Group’s radio stations. A total of €180,000 was raised, making it possible to provide displaced, sick children 
undergoing hardship with medical care, safe transport to hospital, life -saving medicines, psychological support, 
food, heating and warm clothing. 
 
 
In addition to causing terrible damage to housing and 
various economic sectors, the flooding in Emilia-Romagna 
particularly affected more vulnerable groups in the 
population, including people with disabilities and the 
elderly living in dedicated facilities that were deprived of 
essential services. 
On 18 June, through the Group’s TV networks, radio 
stations, news, websites and social media, Mediafriends, 
with Mediaset, launched a major fund -raising campaign 
aimed at five specific projects targeting the most 
vulnerable people, run by Anffas Faenza , Casa Della Carità Lugo , Comunità Montepaolo , Fondazione 
Opera Don Baronio Onlus Cesena  and Genitori Ragazzi Disabili . In addition to the spot campaign, the 
“Partita del Cuore per la Romagna” (match of the heart for Romagna) between the Nazionale Cantanti and the 
Golden Team per la Romagna was organised in Rimini on 20 July and broadcast in prime time on Italia 1. The 
proceeds of the match were allocated to the 5 projects. Then in September, in the “ Caduta Libera - I Migliori” 


Page 183:
 
6 ▪ Community and Territory SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 
 
179 
TV super tournament, hosted by Gerry Scotti on Canale 5, the contestants competed to support the five projects. 
A total of €225,000 was collected and fully distributed to the 5 projects. 
 
From 4 to 12 November, Mediafriends supported the 
2023 Associazione Italiana Editori campaign “#Io leggo 
perché”, which aims to donate books to school libraries 
to reinforce the habit of books and reading in the 
everyday lives of young people. A total of 582,749 books 
was donated (482,749 by the public and 100,000 by 
publishers) in the 3,609 participating bookshops for the 
25,394 schools and 330 nurseries that registered for the 
project.  
 
The “A Regola d’Arte” (ARdA)  project, which is aimed 
towards disadvantaged Italian and foreign children living 
in the suburbs of Italian cities and seeks to promote 
integration and social development through music and 
rugby saw three new centres opening in 2023 (one in 
Rome and two in Milan). The “A regola d’Arte” project, in 
addition to the centres in Rome (four), has 7 centres in 
the Milan metropolitan area and one in Naples, Catania, 
Lecce and Forlì, making 15 in total nationally and 
involving around 65 0 children. During the summer, a 
campus was developed in Naples, where sports and music activities continued. In order to promote and develop 
the activities of “A Regola d'Arte”, Mediafriends has identified partners, active in the individual national areas, 
who oversee the project locally and ensure that every boy or girl taking part can take full benefit from it.  
 
Artistic and charitable collaboration between 
Mediafriends and the Fondazione Cassa dei Risparmi 
di Forlì was also reconfirmed for 2023. A partnership that 
over time has made it possible to develop 16 projects 
throughout the country in favour of the most vulnerable, 
the sick, women and mothers in need of protection, young 
people living in challenging situatio ns and forgotten 
outskirts.  
In particular, the exhibition “The Art of Fashion. TheAge 
of Dreams and Revolutions ” was held at the Musei di 
San Domenico in Forlì from 18 March to 2 July. Part of the entrance fee was donated to support the “ Scuola di 


Page 184:

180 
Vita” project, conceived by Mediafriends in 2021 to offer young people in difficulty the opportunity to undertake 
non-traditional training with the help of artisans capable of conveying great passion for their work, as well as their 
technical and creative skills. 
The “Scuola di vita” project continued. This is aimed at 
young people in difficulty, stalled by academic failure, bad 
life choices or challenging family situations. The goal is to 
offer a real possibility not only of entering the world of 
work, but of making full use of personal interests and 
discovering talent. The project identifies young men and 
women according to their needs, characteristics and 
motivations and “sets them to work” for 6 months with a 
master of trades, a craftsman in a broad sense, identified 
on the basis of their ability to convey a passion for work 
and a lifestyle as well as technical expertise. The master of trades is remunerated for their training efforts and the 
young people all benefit from a paid 6 -month apprenticeship. Four new courses were developed in 2023, after 
identifying new craftsmen in the fields of automotive, tailored clothing and mechanics. 
The project, in its third year, conceived, supported and promoted by Mediafriends in partnership with Comunità 
Nuova Onlus and Soleterre Onlus, will soon be accompanied by a qualitative analysis of the results achieved, 
which began in March with analysis of the project’s various components and continued in the autumn with a series 
of interviews with the craftsmen and young people who completed the course, conducted by an expert in the field 
of sociology and education. The analysis and research work will be completed in the course of 2024 and will allow 
an overall assessment of the strengths and areas for improvement of this particular project.  
The “Orchestra giovanile 4/8” project was launched in 
September 2020 with the aim of creating an orchestra 
that brings young people in a difficult area together in the 
space of four years. The 4 of the name stands for the area 
of Milan where the group is active and 8 (of four eighths) 
recalls the “Ottava nota” Music School that runs this 
project together with Mediafriends.  Among the projects 
developed in the area in recent years, this is certainly the 
most complex in terms of organisation. In the past year, 
the project involved 43 youn g people, 8 of whom with 
disabilities, 8 teachers, an artistic director and a conductor. Also during 2023, the Orchestra 4/8 scheduled and 
performed 5 public concerts, including two in Fondazione Don Gnocchi’s residential care homes. One of the goals 
that Mediafriends set for itse lf in this project is locating instruments for the young people, whose families don’t 
have the means to buy them. Thanks to the “ Casa dello Spirito e delle Arti ”, five violins handmade in The 
lutherie and carpentry workshop in the Opera prison were donated to the orchestra. These were joined by 
a cello, two recorders and a metallophone by the end of the year.

In the spring of 2023, the “Obiettivo Alberi” initiative 
developed by Mediafriends with the Fondazione 
Alberitalia and the collaboration of the Trento Provincial 
Forestry Agency resumed to restore four hectares of the 
Paneveggio forest heavily affected by the terrible “Vaia 
storm”. In April, thanks to the funds raised in 2022, the 
first 6,000 seedlings were planted and the operation was 
partly documented during an episode of Mattino 5, hosted 
by Francesco Vecchi. 
With the fundraising campaign restarting in October, the 
initiative entered its final stage and ended on 31 October. Since the seedlings can only be planted in the spring, 
the initiative will tangibly conclude in the first half of 2024, but the fundraising figures allow us to say that the 
initiative has reached its goal of €90,000. To ensure that the forest is more resilient to climate change, preference 
was and will be given to planting wild varieties from the Paneveggio area, better suited to the local soil and climate: 
service tree, Swiss pine, spruce, larch and sycamore. 
 
 
Mediafriends has for years supported and helped 
organise the Festival del Cinema Nuovo , an 
Associazione Romeo Della Bella initiative and 
international competition for short films with 
performances from people with disabilities. It promotes 
it through communication campaigns organised in 
collaboration with the Mediaset Creative Department.  
With Brescia as Capital of Culture 2023, the ten films of 
the “Questa storia continua” selection dedicated to the 
theme of disability and selected with a contribution 
from the Giffoni Film Festival were screened on 10 and 11 October in Bergamo. Scheduled for the afternoon of 12 
October was the conference entitled “Disability is a film” and at the end of the three days, the screening of the 
2023 film Champions, which tells the story of a team of players with intellectual disabilities, dubbed in the Italian 
version by young people with the same disabilities as the characters they voiced. 
Since 2023, the film festival, which has always been held every two years, has become annual, but with the 
specification that in the “odd” year an international selection of films dealing with the subject of disability, but 
featuring professional actors, will be presented to the public. This allows the audience to be shown two different 
perspectives on the same subject and generates continuity for the Festival del Cinema Nuovo’s activity. In addition, 
since the end of December, a spot has been aired on Mediaset Networks inviting people to enter their short film 
in the 13th edition of the international competition for short films featuring people with disabilities, which will be 
held in autumn 2024. As always, all works created in Communities, Socio-Educational Centres, Day or Residential 
Centres, Organisations and facilities for people with disabilities can be entered in the competition. 
Thanks to the commitment demonstrated to promoting diversity and inclusion at an international level by giving 
voice to different stories and perspectives, the Festival received a special mention during the 15th edition of 
“Nostalgia di futuro”, the event organised by Osservatorio TuttiMedia that took place in Rome on 13 December 
2023.

 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 6 ▪ Community and Territory

Thousands of hectares of wooded and unwooded areas 
are destroyed every year in Italy: official statistics have 
shown that almost 25% of these incidents, concentrated 
mainly in the summer months, were caused by fires 
originating from negligent, superficial use of fire and 
objects that can cause fires to sta rt. In order to prevent 
forest fires in Italy, Mediafriends with Fondazione 
AlberItalia and the support of the Conference of Regions 
and Autonomous Provinces therefore considered it 
important to tackle this phenomenon by promoting an 
awareness-raising campaign. The initiative, which ran from 23 July to 2 September, consisted of two different TV 
spots aired on the Mediaset Networks which aimed to make people aware that certain careless or irresponsible 
behaviour can cause dangerous fires. 
 
Together with Publitalia’80, Mediafriends manages a pool of social communications. During 2023, more than 
one hundred associations benefited from a free spot campaign and, thanks to the work and availability of 
Mediaset’s Creative Department, eleven 30" spots were produced for Third Sector Associations. 
In order to strengthen the internal control system for the social utility project management process, Mediafriends 
deemed it appropriate to identify a registered Statutory Auditor to whom auditing -related services should be 
assigned. 
Mediafriends has always carried out this reporting activity by relying first on internal Mediaset staff and then on 
external collaborators from different professional backgrounds. The importance of reporting is so central to the 
activities of the Mediaset, Mondadori and Medusa non-profit that it was felt necessary to identify a self-employed 
professional to entrust with the reporting of the projects supported by Mediafriends, verifying through on -site 
visits and/or remotely the effective and correct allocation of the funds disbursed to the beneficiary association. 
This verification develops through analysis of the accounting documents prepared by the beneficiary association: 
list of expenses incurred with specification of the financial instrument used for payment and verification, including 
sample checks, of supporting documents and whatever else the auditor deems it appropriate to examine. 
This verification process will result in a final report on the status of project implementation and the use of the 
funding provided by Mediafriends.

7.1  COMMITMENT TO 
ENVIRONMENTAL 
PROTECTION 
The Group’s commitment to the environment is also referred to within the Code of Ethics47, with special reference 
to the conduct and provisions on environmental protection, which highlight the central role of environmental 
protection as a key factor in the company.  
The MFE Group is inspired by the principles of respect and protection of the environment and the local territory, 
and their impact on the health of humans and other living species. To achieve this goal, all MFE business activity 
complies with the highest standards of compatibility and environmental safety. 
As proof of this commitment, the Group has adopted a specific Corporate Organisational Guideline ( O.G. 
"Requirements for environmental protection") which describes the activities carried out for the collection 
and disposal of waste produced, which is treated according to the principles of selective separation and recycling 
of waste wherever possible and as required by current laws and best operating practices. 
7.2 EU TAXONOMY 
REGULATORY CONTEXT 
Regulation 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 48 introduced the 
classification and reporting system of the European Taxonomy to direct investments towards activities defined 
as environmentally sustainable in a language common to the main actors in the market, facilitating the 
transition to a net-0-emissions economy, more resilient to the effects of climate change and attentive to the use 
of resources.  
For the purposes of this legislation, an activity that contributes substantially to achieving one or more of the 6 
environmental objectives without causing significant harm to any of the others is considered “environmentally 
sustainable”. These objectives are: 
1. Climate change mitigation 
2. Climate change adaptation 
 
47 The specific provision has been confirmed in the new Code of Ethics adopted by the Group and its subsidiaries in 2019: Art. 2 6 (Environmental protection) "1. The MFE Group considers protecting the 
environment to be a key factor in the company and is inspired by the principles of respect for and protection of the environment and the local territory, due both to their intrinsic value and their impact on the 
health of humans and other living species. To this end, the MFE Group is committed to observing the re gulations in force and works so that all its business activity complies with the highest standards of 
environmental safety and compatibility.  
Particular attention is dedicated to the collection and disposal of waste produced by the company, which wherever possible is treated according to the principles of selective separation and recycling of waste, 
to reduce the impact on the environment to a minimum and as required by current laws and best operating practices." 
48 European Parliament and Council, REGULATION (EU) 2020/852 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment 
and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088.

185 
3. Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources 
4. Transition to a circular economy 
5. Pollution prevention and reduction 
6. Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems 
Specifically, for the purposes of this Regulation, to qualify as eco -sustainable and be considered Taxonomy-
aligned, an economic activity must jointly satisfy a series of conditions: 
 contributing substantially to one or more of the six environmental objectives referred to in Article 9 of the 
Regulation; 
 complying with the technical screening criteria established by the Commission for each environmental 
objective; 
 not causing significant harm to the other environmental objectives (“do no significant harm” principle); 
 being carried out in compliance with the minimum safeguards (in line with the OECD guidelines and the 
United Nations/ILO guiding principles on business and human rights). 
Pursuant to the regulatory requirements set out in the Delegated Act relating to Article 8 of EU Regulation 
2020/852, the MFE Group is required to include information on how and to what extent its activities can be defined 
as eco-sustainable according to the EU Taxonomy in its Non-Financial Disclosure.  
For this third year of application, the MFE Group has prepared a disclosure that includes the share of taxonomy-
eligible economic activities  and those that are not taxonomy -eligible, in relation to its turnover, capital 
expenditure and operating expenses. 
The MFE Group subsequently analysed the criteria set out in the Regulation and the technical annexes for all 
eligible activities identified (or ‘taxonomy alignment’). The indicators indicated have been calculated on the basis 
of the indications contained i n Annex 1 to Regulation (EU) 2021/2178, are based on the data currently available 
and the current interpretation of the legislation for the first two of the six environmental objectives and may 
therefore be subject to changes in the future.  
THE MFE GROUP APPROACH 
In line with the legislative requirements, both the “statistical classification of economic activities in the European 
Communities” (NACE) and the descriptions of the activities listed in Annex I and Annex II of the Delegated Climate 
Act 2021/4987 have been analysed to determine the eligibility of economic activities, regardless of whether one 
or all of the technical screening criteria are met. 
The Group has prepared further analysis, following the 27 June 2023 publication by the European Commission 
of further annexes which establish the technical screening criteria in order to identify and determine eco -
sustainable activities for the objectives referring to: 

Page 190:
 
 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 7 ▪ The environment 
 
186 
 Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources 
 Transition to a circular economy 
 Pollution prevention and reduction 
 Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems 
The typology of the Group's activities was compared with the list of new eco -sustainable activities defined by the 
European Commission. From this internal analysis, no MFE Group activities were found to be eligible for these 
objectives. Broadcasting (TV and Radio) and film production and distribution activities alone were instead eligible 
for the climate change adaptation  objective. Adaptation activities can only be reported as "eligible" under 
Capex and Opex and must pass the criteria of substantial contribution to climate change adaptation to be eligible. 
The taxonomy-eligible economic activities identified are: 
 8.3 - Programming and broadcasting activities 
 13.3 - Film, video and TV programme production, music and sound recording activities 
The Group’s main revenue -generating activity, the sale of advertising space, is not among those identified as 
taxonomy-eligible. 
The appropriate analyses were prepared on this basis also for 2023, to identify the financial information required 
by the Taxonomy and produce the economic KPIs of revenues, capital and operating expenses.  
In 2023 too, finally, as required by the EU Regulation, MFE also assessed the alignment of the above activities, 
through specific analyses intended to verify: (i) technical criteria for a substantial contribution to climate change 
adaptation; ii) the absen ce of factors capable of causing significant harm to the rest of the environmental 
objectives (DNSH) and iii) compliance with the minimum safeguards envisaged by article 18 of Delegated 
Regulation 2020/852.  
CRITERIA FOR SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTION 
As part of analysing the technical criteria for a substantial contribution to climate change adaptation, the physical 
climate risks aligned with the specifications described in Appendix A of the Taxonomy were analysed for the first 
time. The goal of these analyses was to verify the degree of resilience from the perspective of operational 
continuity of the operative structures for the Group’s eligible activities in both Italy and Spain  – the main 
geographical areas in which the Group operates  – in relation t o certain categories of significant risks identified 
among those included in the appendix to the Regulation that may significantly compromise the operability of 
physical and technological structures in the coming years and compromise the business continuity of the Group’s 
activities. These analyses were performed through a risk and vulnerability climate change assessment, in order to 
identify the potential physical risks applicable to the organisation and their relative exposure. Specific tools were 
used to generate climate change forecast scenarios between 10 and 30 years. The analysis identified, in the most 
pessimistic cases with further increases in average temperatures, a high risk of hydrogeological phenomena near 
the areas where the Group’s operational sites are located, and analysed the appropriate physical solutions already 
available to the Group.

187 
MINIMUM SAFEGUARDS 
The analysis of compliance with the minimum safeguards was performed with the goal of verifying the absence of 
cases of violations/disputes as at the date of this report, as well as the existence and effective application of 
governance models and procedure s in line with those required by best practices and international reference 
frameworks, regarding: i) protection and respect for human rights, ii) prevention of corruption, governance and 
tax compliance offences, iii) compliance with fair competition rules.  
The analyses performed did not identify any cases of violation or significant disputes with respect to the areas 
analysed. The activities also generally attested to an adequate level of supervision by the Group (governance and 
guidelines), which operates in regulatory and labour law contexts characterised by a high level of regulation. 
In particular:  
Human Rights: the MFE Group has always worked with a firm commitment to the protection of Human Rights, 
with organisational actions and safeguards that guarantee within its organisation, towards employees and 
collaborators, full respect and protection of the fundamental  rights of individuals in accordance with the values 
and principles as expressed in its Code of Ethics.  During 2023, the Group started a process of analysing the ESG 
positioning of certain categories representative of its supplier portfolio, with the aim of implementing a process 
of gradual adoption of ESG criteria to integrate its own evaluation and supplier selection models, also evaluating 
the adoption of suitable and functional human rights due diligence procedures, in order to identify, evaluate 
and manage the potential negative impacts caused by the normal development of its business along the entire 
value chain. Depending on the progress of these activities over the next year, and in anticipation of the expansion 
of the scope of stakehol ders involved, the Group will evaluate the finalisation of a structured Policy in line with 
best practices and international reference standards in which the Group's commitment to respecting human rights 
will be formalised.  
Corruption: the company has strict policies and procedures for the prevention of crimes of corruption, with 
particular reference in Italy to Compliance Programmes pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/01.  
Taxation: MFE manages governance and tax compliance matters as key components in developing its business 
with an approach of continuous supervision.  
Fair competition : the MFE Group operates in full compliance with the laws and regulations in force and 
commonly recognised ethical principles as described in articles 2, 20 and 23 of its Code of Ethics.  In 2019, the 
Group also initiated a process to adopt a specific Antitrust Compliance Programme, understood as a system 
of rules predominantly directed towards preventing potentially significant conduct in terms of antitrust offences. 
After the Italian Antitrust Authority (AGCM) issued “ Antitrust Compliance G uidelines”, this activity led to the 
preparation of a specific Antitrust Compliance Programme in 2022, adopted by MFE at the beginning of 2023. 
In 2023, in line with the sustainable broadcasting content development guidelines adopted, the Group is defining 
a shared model for correlating self -produced content and content in its multimedia offering with the 17 
Sustainable Development Goals in the UN 2030 Agenda. 
This analysis was also performed in response to the regulatory requirement of the European taxonomy in order to 
identify the Group’s own products and broadcast content able to increase the level of resilience or to contribute 

Page 192:
 
 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 7 ▪ The environment 
 
188 
to the efforts of the public to adapt. To date, the indicators, determined solely by broadcast content 
“predominantly” focused on environmental issues and connected to “climate change”, would not fully represent 
the complex activity of promoting and distributing such content that the Group offers in its role as a responsible, 
pluralist broadcaster. This is the case especially within other segments of the offering (mainly news and 
infotainment) which can be difficult to isolate and measure by their nature. 
The Group will continue this process in order to define measures and indicators that represent its own social and 
environmental contribution provided on the basis of shares of programming. 
Despite this, since a human rights policy (at the definition stage) has not yet been finalised as at the reference date 
of this report, the Group cannot confirm (as already indicated in the 2022 Report) compliance with the minimum 
safeguards within its scope. 
PERFORMANCE INDICATORS 
KPI calculation methodology  
In line with the requirements of the Taxonomy Regulation, the MFE Group performed analysis of the turnover, 
investments and operating expenses relating to the 2023 financial year, to calculate the required KPIs and further 
applicable regulatory references 49, as described below. Any cases of double counting in calculating the KPIs 
(Turnover, CapEx and OpEx) were avoided by using the data and information included in the Annual Report as of 
31.12.2023.  
Turnover50 KPI 
For the calculation of the turnover indicator, the consolidated net turnover was considered as the denominator in 
accordance with IAS 1.82(a). With respect to the numerator, on the basis of the considerations cited above and on 
the basis of the interpretation of the Taxonomy Regulation, only the turnover of companies with broadcasting 
activities (TV and Radio) and film production and distribution were considered eligible, economic activities 
considered eligible. 
CapEx51 KPI 
For the calculation of the Capital Expenditure (CapEx) KPI, in line with the provisions of the applicable legislation, 
investments in television and movie broadcasting rights, changes in advances on rights, increases on the rights 
themselves and tangible a nd intangible fixed assets as detailed in the management report were taken into 
consideration in the denominator. 
The denominator includes the movements relating to all the fully consolidated legal entities included in the scope 
of consolidation of the MFE Group, in particular, any acquisitions of tangible assets (IAS 16), intangible assets (IAS 
 
49 The analysis and calculation methodology for the KPIs were performed with particular reference to the interpretation of the i nformation defined by Annex I of the “Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 
2021/2178 of 6 July 2021” which supplements art. 8 of the Regulation (EU) 2020/852) and the document “Draft Commission notice on the interpretation of certain legal provisions of the Disclosures Delegated 
Act under Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation on the reporting of eligible economic activities and assets” published on 2 February 2022. 
50 The financial data included in this KPI correspond to the Group’s net revenues included in the Annual Report as of 31 December 2023: Paragraphs 6.1 and 6.2 
51 The financial data included in this KPI correspond to the increases in fixed assets included in the 2023 Annual Report: Paragraph of the Cash Flow Statement 

Page 193:

189 
38), and assets for user rights (IFRS 16).  
As regards the numerator, only the movements described above relating to eligible legal entities were considered 
eligible. Therefore, the remaining part of increases in tangible and intangible fixed assets and user rights 
considered in the denominator were not considered as ineligible.  
OpEx52 KPI 
To calculate the Operating Expenditure (OpEx) KPI, the denominator, in line with the provisions of the applicable 
legislation, was considered to be the totality of the non -capitalised direct costs linked to building renovation 
measures, short-term leasing and variable lease payments, maintenance and repairs as well as any other direct 
expense connected to the daily maintenance of property, plant and equipment, by the company or by third parties 
to whom these tasks are outsourced, necessary to guarantee the continuous and effective functioning of these 
assets. All operating costs that do not belong to the categories mentioned above have not been included. 
With respect to the numerator, the costs included in the denominator relating to the companies of the legal entities 
considered eligible were considered eligible. In the denominator, the remaining part of the operating costs of the 
legal entities were therefore not considered as ineligible. 
The proportion of eligible and non -eligible activities for the year 2023 is indicated on the basis of the criteria 
defined above. With respect to the turnover indicator for eligibility, the analysis was 7%, in relation to CAPEX, 99%, 
and OPEX, 59%53. In relation to alignment, given the circumstances described above, these three indicators have 
a value of 0% (see the following tables for further details). 
 
52 The financial data included in this KPI is included in the consolidated operating costs included in the 2023 Annual Report: Paragraph 6.4, this value cannot be directly derived within the breakdown used by 
the MFE Group as the individual natures do not all have the same degree of significance. 
53 The economic values on which calculation of taxonomy KPIs is based have been taken from the MFE Group’s consolidated financia l statements as at 31/12/2023 prepared in accordance with the IAS/IFRS. 
For further information on the accounting procedures adopted by the Group, please refer to Chapter 2 (“Basis of presentation and accounting principles for the preparation of the financial statements”) of the 
Supplementary Note to the aforementioned documents.

7.3  MANAGEMENT OF ELECTROMAGNETIC 
EMISSIONS 
The MFE Group in Italy54 has always been committed to respecting the sector legislation on electromagnetic 
emissions.  
Elettronica Industriale S.p.A., a subsidiary of the MFE Group, is required to present documentation to the local 
authorities certifying compliance with the field limits of plants for the installation of new plants or for the 
modification of existing plants.  
In 2023, 352 requests were made to modify plants, compliant with current regulations, including compliance with 
the population exposure limits for electromagnetic fields. 
These activities allow the Group to monitor the impact generated by any changes made to the plants throughout 
the area while guaranteeing the absence of any negative effects deriving from radio -television signal emissions. 
The applications must obligatoril y contain all electromagnetic impact assessments of the plants subject to the 
authorisation request.  
The Electromagnetic Impact Analysis (EIA) for larger plants are extremely thorough and include “pre-existing 
electromagnetic background” levels and the impact of that individual plant. The reference standards for the 
Electromagnetic Impact Analysis are those reported in Law 36/2001 and include the maximum permitted levels to 
which the population can be subjected55. 
Furthermore, while complying with regulatory limits, Elettronica Industriale S.p.A. continuously assesses any 
specific provisions set by individual municipalities as well as any indications of any provincial, state and 
international location plans for transmission sites.  
As regards the assessment of the overall impact of the transmission sites (within which Elettronica Industriale 
S.p.A. plants also operate), the role of the ARPA departmental agencies (Regional Agency for Environment 
Protection) must also be taken into consideration, which is responsible for monitoring activities through periodic 
analysis and sampling of the plants, with particular attention to more prone units of the company.  
As part of managing relations with public bodies, Elettronica Industriale S.p.A. always provides absolute 
availability for inspections and collaborates with the ARPA, even in a preventive manner, using comparison 
activities during meetings with those public bodies. 
The most sensitive plants have been monitored in recent years by the regional agencies (ARPAs) without penalties 
being imposed on Mediaset for failure to comply with the limits. 
During 2023, the Regional Environmental Protection Agencies carried out 6 inspections including one inspection 
on a critical location due to the high powers transmitted or the proximity of homes to the transmission facilities. 
 
54 The issue of electromagnetism is taken into consideration only in Italy as the MFE Group in Spain does not directly manage the signal transmission network. 
55 The maximum exposure limits allowed by current legislation are 20 V/m in public places (see also par. 3.3) with a caution thr eshold of 6 V/m near housing and places frequented continuously (at least 4 
hours per day). 

Page 199:
 
7 ▪ The environment SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 
 
195 
In all cases, the Group's facilities were found to be in compliance with current regulations on the protection of the 
public from electromagnetic fields. 
The equipment managed by the RadioMediaset company is generally housed at stations that it does not own. 
The appointed RadioMediaset Office independently, or with the support of specialist companies and/or the tower 
operator itself, provided with the technical documentation necessary, draws up the applications to present to the 
local authorities for authorisation to change existing equipment and/or activate new equipment. 
The procedure adopted by the Group for the radio station in order to monitor electromagnetic pollution and 
safeguard the community is divided into the following activities: 
 Execution of an Electromagnetic Impact Analysis (EIA) for each plant it intends to install ex novo or whose 
emission characteristics are to be modified by specialised third-party companies and personnel in possession 
of the qualifications required by current legislation, in order to ensure compliance with the exposure limits, 
attention thresholds and quality objectives for electromagnetic emissions as required by current legislation; 
 Selection and contracting of the aforementioned counterparties in line with the provisions of the current 
company guidelines; 
 Submission of the request for installation and operation of radio equipment (including the aforementioned 
EIA) to the Single Contact Point for Productive Activity (SUAP) of the municipality responsible for that area by 
a company lawyer or by the company/pr ofessional who carried out the aforementioned analysis, by 
delegation of a company representative; 
 Assessment of the EIA by the Regional Agency for Environmental Protection (ARPA) for that area. Issue of the 
authorisation for installation and operation of radio equipment by the competent Municipality, subject to 
obtaining permission from the local ARPA; 
 Continuous monitoring of the operation of Group radio equipment by dedicated department via verification 
of the data acquired by the equipment through telemetry. Where anomalies are detected that could cause 
the equipment to operate at higher energy levels  than those envisaged, the department will promptly alert 
the competent maintenance companies in order to resolve any anomalies found; 
 Periodic checking on the operation of the systems by specifically contracted maintenance companies;  
 In recent years, a complete mapping of all the radio equipment managed by the MFE Group in Italy was 
performed by a specialised third-party company, aimed at assessing the risks pertaining to individual systems 
and preparing the related RADs (Risk Assessment Documents). Measurements were carried out on the overall 
level of electromagnetic emissions from the stations where radio equipment operated by the Group is 
installed in Italy (these were cumulative measurements, bearing in mind that there may be severa l systems 
belonging to various radio companies at a single location) and, where necessary, measurements on the 
emissions level of the Group's systems (narrow measurements), in order to ensure compliance with the 
electromagnetic emission threshold imposed b y current legislation. Where anomalies were detected, 
installers/maintenance technicians were promptly alerted to resolve them.

During the 2023 financial year, 13 SCIA start of activity communications for equipment to be activated at existing 
structures/antennas or equipment lower than 20 W were submitted to the ARPA and 7 applications  for 
authorisation for equipment exceeding 20 W, for a total of 20 assessments (EIA), joined by 1 test report (post 
activation-checks requested by the authority).  
The ARPA carried out 2 monitoring operations (periodic checks on the territory by the authority) during the 
reference year involving 2 sites, for a total of 7 systems. Through the monitoring, the ARPA identified non -
compliance with the limit envisaged at 1 site due to multiple exposures. This involved 3 managed systems 
and others belonging to third parties, for which assessments with a view to joint total restoration are still 
underway. 
In 2023, 1 financial penalty was issued for collusion with third parties in exceeding the limits and values 
referred to in the Prime Ministerial Decree of 07.08.2003 relating to the year 2021. The Office has filed a request 
to relocate the systems involved. There was 1 injunction for payment of a pecuniary administrative sanction 
relating to a 2020 notification report for failure to communicate possession of the LR 29/93 Veneto 
system in 2012 . The Office also gathers the data for drawing up the Risk Asses sment Document, including the 
electromagnetic field levels, which allow appropriate interventions for remedying the most important issues to be 
identified and developed, for a 2023 total of 603 checks with measurements and 540 Plant Risk Assessment 
Documents prepared, of which 344 were updates. 
There were no risks to station workers since the electromagnetic levels detected are completely within the 
thresholds prescribed by law.  
In any case, in an effort to further reduce risk, the power of the transmitting plants is reduced during any work at 
height on the pylon/pole, thus keeping the exposure of workers to electromagnetic fields to a minimum.

7.4  WASTE MANAGEMENT  
In order to minimise its impact on the local territory, the MFE Group, including foreign investee companies, 
constantly monitors its consumption of raw materials and the waste produced by its activities.  
The Group mainly produces waste connected to its specific activity, such as mixed packaging materials, toner, 
electrical and electronic equipment and bulky waste (e.g. sets), and hazardous waste composed of materials from 
ordinary maintenance activities (e .g. neon lights and batteries). Lastly, it is worth mentioning the possible 
production of hazardous waste due to the hospital service. 
 
WASTE BY TYPE (TONs) 2023 2022 
Bulky Waste 332 483 
Mixed-Material Packaging 493 424 
Plastic 6 17 
Broken equipment, other than that indicated in 16 02 09 to 16 02 13  129 134 
Paper and Cardboard Packaging 61 69 
Other (hazardous) 9 5 
Other (non-hazardous) 141 125 
Total 1,171 1,256 
   
 
All the waste produced is managed in compliance with current Italian environmental regulations, and the 
collection process is managed by means of special containers approved for each specific type of waste.  
The MFE Group also adopts control activities with respect to the administrative management of waste, through 
the supervision of the transport and disposal process, coordinating with the supply companies in compliance 
with the terms established by law. 
The verification of authorisations and administrative management of waste pursuant to the law for Italian offices 
is carried out through a third-party specialist consultancy company that carries out, in addition to the activities of 
audit on waste management, also the compilation of mandatory registers.  
It should also be noted that, within the company, there has always been separate collection of waste.  
During 2023, the Group produced approximately 1,171 tons of waste, a reduction compared to 2022 in correlation 
with the technological composition of the film sets. Hazardous waste constitutes a minimal part (about 2% of the 
total waste produced), managed according to the ADR protocol (Accord Dangereuses Route). 
It should be noted that during 2023 in the company break areas, plastic cups and accessories were eliminated, 
replacing them with similar eco -sustainable items. The plastic reduction project foresees further phases in the 
coming years.

The MFE Group in Spain  monitors the consumption of paper, CDs and toners in all its offices. This monitoring 
focuses specifically on the Fuencarral and Villaviciosa offices in Madrid, where all activities related to audiovisual 
production are concentrated, and involves around 94% of the workforce. 
In 2023, all waste generated by the MFE Group in Spain was managed appropriately, promoting recycling activities 
according to national legislation. 
In 2023, the MFE Group in Spain continued with work to eliminate non-biodegradable plastic waste in the canteen 
and adjoining bar, continuing to implement separate waste collection, as in the rest of the company. 
In compliance with the regulations governing hazardous and non -hazardous waste, the Group has appointed a 
specialised third party company for its management. 
Waste electrical and electronic equipment is managed by technical warehouse workers, while organic waste 
produced by the canteen is collected and separated by kitchen personnel according to the type of material. 
Hazardous waste included batteries, fluorescent tubes and printer material.

7.5  MANAGEMENT OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND 
EMISSIONS 
The main energy sources used by the MFE Group, in Italy and Spain and in the other foreign investee companies, 
for the performance of its activities are divided into four types: electricity, natural gas, diesel and petrol.  
The main energy sources used by the MFE Group, both in Italy and in Spain and in the other foreign subsidiaries, 
for the performance of its activities are divided into four types: electricity, natural gas, diesel and petrol.  
The largest percentage of energy consumption is due to electricity, used mainly for the power supply and 
operation of offices, studios and radio stations, including servers, data centres and technologies for the continuity 
of technical equipment, as well as air conditioning and lighting of the Group's facilities. 
During 2023, a total of about 283 TJ of electricity was consumed, about 9% less than in 2022. Electricity and gas 
emissions 2023, down compared to 2022, show the results of the consumption rationalisation actions 
implemented mainly on the radio network and on company buildings. In addition, part of these reductions can be 
attributed to more favourable climatic seasons. 
In Spain, as in Italy, consumption is mainly due to the technical equipment of the studios, including recording, 
transmission and post -production equipment, as well as computer equipment and air conditioning in the 
computer rooms. 
During 2023, with regard to the consumption described above, the activity aimed at achieving greater efficiency 
continued, especially through the replacement of energy inefficient equipment.  
In particular: 
 replacement of high-consumption lights with more efficient led lights for television studios; 
 replacement of obsolete computers and printers, favouring models with a lower environmental impact; 
 installation of new solar panels on buildings 
A project to build photovoltaic systems  for self -production has also been launched in Italy at the Group's 
headquarters in Cologno Monzese, which will start producing energy by the end of 2024. 
The fuel consumption (petrol and diesel) of the MFE Group, in 2023, amounted to 25 TJ, mainly attributable to the 
company's machinery fleet and to some generators. The MFE Group's corporate fleet in Italy consists of long-term 
rental cars and a specific owned car fleet in Spain. 
Natural gas is used for the heating of some offices, production areas and laboratory and warehouse studios and 
represents 8.3% of the total energy consumed.  
To reduce emissions as much as possible and raise awareness among its employees, the MFE Group in Italy and 
Spain offers its staff a shuttle service that connects the company's facilities with metro stations, over a wide 
range of hours, in order to encourage greater use of collective means of transport. 
About initiatives on the car fleet, in Italy the Group's commitment to fleet sustainability continues through the 

Page 204:
 
 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 7 ▪ The environment 
 
200 
progressive replacement of endothermic vehicles with new electrified cars (plug-in hybrids or full electric) and the 
creation of charging infrastructures in the offices. 
In this regard, we highlight that the vehicle fleet held by the MFE Group in Spain includes 1 minibus for the 
transport of employees and a fleet of cars for long -term rental, for the exclusive use of the group's executives, 
consisting of 21 diesel, 13 petrol and 21 hybrid cars.

[*] Scope 1 emissions are expressed in metric tons of CO 2 equivalent. Scope 2 emissions are expressed in tons of CO 2, but the percentage of methane and nitrous oxide has a negligible effect on the total 
emissions of greenhouse gases (CO2 equivalent) as can be deduced from the reference technical literature. 
To provide a more meaningful representation of the MFE Group’s Scope 1 emissions, the source of the emission factors used for the calculation was updated during the year. For the figures published previously, 
please refer to the 2022 Sustainability Report published in the “Sustainability” section of the mfemediaforeurope.com website. 
[**] 2023 data: Natural gas emission coefficient equal to 2.03839 kgCO 2e/Sm3, diesel oil emission coefficient equal to 2.51206 kgCO 2e/l, petrol emission coefficient equal to 2.09747 kgCO 2e/l (source: DEFRA 
2023. UK Government - GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting). 
2022 data: Natural gas emission coefficient equal to 2.01574 kgCO2e/Sm3, diesel oil emission coefficient equal to 2.55784 kgCO2e/l, petrol emission coefficient equal to 2.16185 kgCO2e/l (source: DEFRA 2022. 
UK Government - GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting).  
 
In 2023, the Group’s activities generated greenhouse gas emissions due to direct energy consumption (natural 
gas, petrol and diesel) and indirect energy consumption (electricity) of the Group itself. In particular, a high 
proportion of the greenhouse gas emissions are due to Scope 2 emissions, for which MFE is indirectly responsible, 
as it derives from the electricity supply purchased externally. However, the zero contribution of the Group to this 

Page 205:
 
7 ▪ The environment SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 
 
201 
type of emissions (according to the Market -based approach) is noteworthy, since all electricity of the Group is 
covered by certificates of guarantee of origin i.e. from renewable sources. 
The reporting standard used (GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards 2016) provides for two different approaches 
to calculating Scope 2 emissions: "location-based" and "market-based". The "location-based" approach envisages 
the use of a national average emi ssion factor related to the specific national energy mix for the production of 
electricity (emission coefficient used for Italy of 315 gCO 2/kWh and for France of 56 gCO 2/kWh - Source: TERNA, 
International Comparisons 2023). The "Market-based" approach envisages the use of an emission factor defined 
on a contractual basis with the electricity supplier. Given the absence of specific contractual agreements between 
MFE Group in France and the electricity supplier (e.g. purchase of Guarantees of Origin), the emi ssion factor 
relating to the national "residual mix" was used for this approach (emission coefficient used of 125 gCO 2/kWh - 
Source: Association of Issuing Bodies, European Residual Mixes 2021, 2022).  
Finally, the direct emissions of Scope 1 generated directly within the Group due to the use of fuels for heating, 
generators and the car fleet amount to approximately 3.743 tCO2eq. 
Since 2023, emissions in Italy have been monitored and reported according to the GHG Protocol standards , 
whose conformity is validated by a third-party certifying body. 
It should be noted that the MFE Group in Spain identifies, measures and manages its emissions and establishes 
appropriate measures for their reduction. In addition to quantifying the emissions generated, the company also 
makes this information public, which demonstrates its degree of awareness and tra nsparency in this sector. The 
commitment of the MFE Group in Spain to transparency is reflected in its participation in the Carbon Disclosure 
Project (CDP) initiative since 2009, with which the Group agrees to publicise its objectives and the methods 
implemented to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
