Foreword by our President
and CEO
We believe that technology has a critical role to play in addressing the
environmental, social, and economic challenges facing our world today.
We are committed to developing innovative technologies and products
that enable the transformation of our economies and societies through
digitalization, smarter mobility, and decarbonization.
During the year, we saw continued business growth, driven by strong
demand in Automotive and, to a lesser extent, Industrial. This was
partially offset by lower revenues for Personal Electronics. To enable our
future growth and drive enhanced profitability, we made further
progress on the transformation of our manufacturing base. This
included the expansion of our 300mm capacity and a strong focus on
wide-bandgap semiconductors. Investments in manufacturing capacity
were complemented by investments to reduce emissions and improve
the operational footprint of our facilities.
In the context of evolving trade dynamics and challenges resulting from
climate change, we remain committed to driving progress across our
sustainability programs and improving resilience across all aspects of our business. This commitment is also reflected in our
ambitious goal of becoming carbon neutral on scope 1 and 2, and partially on scope 3 by 2027.
Each year we make substantial progress towards these ambitious targets. In 2023, the global sourcing of electricity from
renewable energy grew to 71%, on track to reach our target of 100% by 2027. Long-term power purchasing agreements are a
key part of our strategy and we signed a significant agreement in Italy to produce 250GWh renewable energy per year. In 2023
our scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions were down 45% in absolute terms compared to 2018. We achieved this while
transforming our manufacturing footprint and despite the challenges in the global energy markets.
Minimizing our own carbon footprint is critical, but we also focus on the positive impact of our products by developing
solutions for a more sustainable society. We continue to collaborate with our global network of academic and private partners,
as we recognize the importance of partnerships in the innovation process.
We are also passionate about supporting and empowering our employees across a range of key topics including employee
experience, career planning, diversity, equity, wellbeing, and inclusion. Employee engagement is high and still growing. In
2023 we established employee resource groups (ERGs) to promote inclusion in the workplace, employee dialogue and
professional development. In less than one year our first ERG for women – WISE (Women Inspiring Supporting and
Empowering) – is growing fast, with 1,400+ members in 60 locations.
Finally, the strategic value of, and interest in, our industry has never been higher. With this comes an increasing need for talent.
During 2023 we continued to expand our awareness, education, and training initiatives around STEM, targeting future young
professionals globally.
In 2023, our progress across multiple areas, as detailed in this report, was once again acknowledged by multiple third-party
assessments. This external recognition is an important validation of our actions and transparency, helping us ensure we
remain aligned with the expectations of our stakeholders.
Jean-Marc Chery
President and CEO
I 2-22 I

Communication and awareness
In 2023, we continued to deploy our Compliance, Ethics and Privacy multi-channel communication
and awareness strategy via our intranet pages (generating more than 100,000 views in 2023),
through our mobile application ST Integrity, and our Viva Engage community ‘Building Trust
Together’. Compliance, Ethics and Privacy was also a topic of interest for external users in 2023,
leading to more than 87,000 views on our new Compliance, Ethics & Privacy internet page and
Privacy Portal. Finally, we participated for the fourth time in the Distribution and Sales Convention
for Asia Pacific, with more than 300 business partners.
Privacy
In 2023, we continued to monitor and adapt to the evolving privacy environment as we faced many
new personal data protection laws with varying requirements, deadlines, enforcement dates, and
rulemaking. The ability of multinational companies to export personal data from the European Union
and Mainland China has been challenged in recent years. We welcomed the EU-US Data Privacy
Framework, which stabilizes cross-border transfers and makes it easier to provide services to our
Integrity: we conduct our business with the highest ethical
standards, honor our commitments, and keep our promises;
we are loyal and fair and stand up for what is right.

stakeholders. To this end, we updated our Privacy Portal at www.st.com  to comply with several
new personal data protection laws (for example, Mainland China, Switzerland, California) and to
provide our stakeholders with dedicated privacy notices to expand our transparency obligations.
In 2023, we did not receive any formal grievance made by individuals or personal data protection
authorities regarding our handling of personal data.
Bribery and corruption
We have a zero-tolerance approach towards any forms of bribery
and corruption, regardless of the identity or position of the
originator or recipient of the bribe. It is also strictly forbidden for
anybody in ST to use Company funds or assets to make a political
contribution.
This applies to all our employees, organizations and third parties
acting on behalf of ST and all transactions in any country where we
operate and do (or seek to do) business. Any violation will be deemed a serious violation of our
Code of Conduct and lead to disciplinary action, including termination of the relationship with ST.
Our Anti-Bribery and Corruption policy (see www.st.com  ) provides clear definitions regarding
instances of bribery and corruption and includes detailed descriptions of the Company’s rules for
engaging with third parties. It also explains how to report actual or suspected violations and outlines
the potential disciplinary actions and legal consequences of any non-compliance.
Speak up and reporting of concerns
At ST, we believe that maintaining a culture of transparency and
ethical behavior is crucial to our success. That’s why we encourage
everyone, including our external business partners, to speak up and
report any concerns they might have regarding possible violations
of our Code of Conduct, policies, or the law. Our managers are
accountable for creating a working atmosphere where employees
feel comfortable speaking up and expressing their concerns freely.
We take all concerns raised seriously and review them thoroughly. To make it easy for our
employees, business partners, and stakeholders to report any concerns, we have an independent
multilingual Ethics Hotline that is available 24/7 online or via phone. We communicate this Ethics
Hotline to all employees through various channels, including our Code of Conduct, dedicated
intranet web pages, and our ST Integrity app. A link to our Ethics Hotline is also accessible on our
intranet, our website, many communication and training materials, and our ST Integrity app.

To ensure that our managers are equipped with the knowledge and skills to create
and maintain an environment where employees feel free to speak up and report any
concerns, we also trained 5,243 managers on the importance of fostering a culture of
transparency and ethical behavior throughout the Company.
All these actions resulted in a 3-fold increase in the number of concerns raised
through the Ethics Hotline in 2023, strenghtening a speak up culture.
Ethics committees
The purpose of our Corporate Ethics Committee is to support ST management in its efforts to foster
a consistent ethical culture across all regions, functions, and organizations. Formed in 2007 and
chaired by our Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, Philippe Dereeper, the committee comprises
senior managers representing various ST organizations.

We determine the amount of risk we are willing to pursue or retain, depending on the expected
rewards, opportunities, and costs.
Our risk appetite depends on the nature of risks. As an illustration, through well-designed and
effective internal controls, we strive to reduce residual exposure to a level as low as reasonably
practicable for the following risk categories:

Our holistic ERM process is embedded company-wide and within more than 20 organizational units,
to ensure specific risk scenarios are addressed at the right level. By systematically considering the
views of numerous executives and external sources, we continually strive to identify and address
emerging risks, including those that are externally driven, fast-evolving, or that might be of
significance in the medium- to long-term, for instance risks related to artificial intelligence in 2023.
This process is facilitated by a global network of ERM champions.

During 2023, we refreshed our Company risk assessment with the executive management team.
The output from this exercise was a risk map linked to our strategic objectives, including nine
redefined ‘priority 1’ risk areas.
Risk owners (members of senior management) were appointed for each priority risk area to develop
risk response plans, adapt to changing external conditions, and enhance monitoring capabilities.
These risk response plans are regularly reviewed by the Executive Committee and periodically
discussed with the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board.
Each organizational unit throughout the Company completes its own risk assessment. This includes
marketing and sales regions, product groups, manufacturing and technology, and corporate
functions. In addition, we implemented further risk assessments on large company programs,
including transformation programs.

Improving our resilience
Our risk approach encompasses a dedicated resilience management system (RMS), focusing on
business continuity and crisis management, to address the following risk factors:
As part of our multi-year improvement roadmap, we further embedded the RMS at our main sites
and selected organizations in 2023, leveraging our Corporate Resilience Competence Center and a
global network of resilience champions.
In 2023, over 50 ERM and resilience champions gathered for a three-day internal conference where
best practices and upcoming improvements were discussed. We implemented several incremental
improvements to our RMS, with fully aligned methodologies and toolkits across ERM, resilience,
business continuity, and crisis management. This provides a consistent methodology to address
potential business disruptions to our resources, such as:
As such, we address scenarios that may affect our supply chain and operations, enabling us to
continually improve our continuity plans. Such scenarios include:
In 2023, we further developed an ST-specific methodology that underpins our global risk
management dashboard. This comprises a range of indicators based on internal or external
standards, covering dimensions such as:
For every significant site, these indicators are compiled in a site resilience index (SRI), that is
updated and improved quarterly. Site management teams prepare and update an annual site
improvement plan accordingly.

audited by a leading independent organization. This was last
performed in 2022, confirming a significant improvement in maturity
compared to the previous audit in 2017. In 2023, additional
independent audits were completed (as outsourced assignments
within our Corporate Audit Plan) focusing on the following specific areas:
In addition, ST has been ISO 22301 certified since 2016, with the current certification valid until
2025. Throughout 2023, our RMS and improvements have been subject to both internal audits and
surveillance audits from the certification body. Such internal audits and external surveillance audits
are scheduled to take place again in 2024.
Sustainability risks
Company-level sustainability risk scenarios are addressed as part of our ERM program. Our
response level corresponds to the level of risk identified. This mapping enables sustainability risks
to be fully integrated into the priority risks of the Company.
In 2023, the main focuses and long-term risk mitigation actions were related to:

For three decades, our business model has been built on a foundation of sustainability. Our
ambition is to create sustainable technology for a sustainable world, creating long-term value for all
our stakeholders. We strongly believe that our dedication to a sustainable culture is beneficial for
people, the environment, the economy, and society.
Accelerating sustainability, together
Throughout our value chain, we have integrated sustainability into our business model. We have
implemented numerous programs to effectively manage our impacts, opportunities, and risks,
ensuring that sustainability remains at the forefront of our operations and activities.
Our guiding principles and 24 sustainability goals are detailed in our sustainability charter, which is
available at www.st.com/sustainabilitycharter � �. This is endorsed by Jean-Marc Chery, our
President and CEO. Our progress towards these annual, 2025 and 2027 goals is described in this
report, with a focus on transparency.
To support our ambitions, we include sustainability criteria among performance indicators for both
short-term and long-term incentive schemes for all senior executives and all other employees
eligible for incentives. The sustainability/corporate social responsibility index short-term incentives
are weighted at 10% with criteria comprising health and safety, environment and climate, diversity
and inclusion as well as people management. Sustainability/corporate social responsibility index
criteria for long-term incentives are weighted at 33.3% and comprise environment and climate,
diversity, inclusion and people engagement, investor ESG index and carbon rating.
As part of our plan to accelerate sustainability and engage our stakeholders, in February and
November 2023 we conducted a series of internal sustainability webcasts, each attracting more
than 3,000 people. The aim was to share our approach to sustainability trends and challenges, and

to update employees on our sustainability programs and performance. There was also an
opportunity for employees to ask their own questions on sustainability during and after the live
events.
Assessing material topics
We have been conducting materiality assessments since 2010 to identify and prioritize the most
significant sustainability topics for our business and stakeholders. We carry out a materiality
exercise every year, including a review with our main stakeholders. This allows us to focus our
efforts on the most relevant issues and integrate them into our strategy, programs, and objectives.
We assess our impacts continually, taking into account the global sustainability context, identifying
emerging and evolving topics, the role of our industry, and evaluating any changes in our activities
and business relationships. We consult with experts and regularly engage with our stakeholders to
gather their views (seeStakeholder engagement). This enables us to understand and integrate the
topics most significant to our stakeholders and that have a positive or negative impact on our
business’ economic, social, and environmental value. Where appropriate, we combine topics to
reflect our highest priorities and the rapidly evolving sustainability environment.
In 2023, we considered sustainability trends and challenges at a global and industry level, reviewing
different sources from the electronics industry and business associations, as well as data-driven
insights from an AI software platform. This provided a framework for a deeper analysis, including
data points from public sources such as corporate financial reports, regulations, voluntary initiatives,
news, and social media.
As in previous years, the most material topics we identified in 2023, and which form the basis of our
priorities, are health and safety, GHG emissions, water efficiency, and human rights. However, we
also took into account concerns expressed by our external stakeholders regarding the potential
impact of our activities on pollution (seeChemicals).

Interview
Can you give an overview of sustainability at ST in 2023?
2023 marked yet another acceleration of sustainability at ST. We see sustainability as a question of
systemic balance. Economic, social, and environmental issues are interdependent, and many
decisions need to be taken to balance short- and long-term needs, risk and opportunities,
mitigation, and adaptation, among others. This approach involves the entire organization, which is
why we appointed additional sustainability champions in 2023. They are responsible for further
embedding ST’s sustainability strategy into all groups and divisions of the Company.
We launched ‘Accelerating sustainability, together’, a program to strengthen and support our
sustainability strategy. It aims to develop ST’s sustainability leadership and embed sustainability in
each step of business strategy, planning, and decision-making. We also implemented accelerator
workstreams to facilitate cross-organization collaboration in priority areas.
What sustainability achievements were you most proud of in 2023?
I’m thrilled that we have been able to support important business growth, while maintaining our
commitment to sustainability. We exceeded all our absolute targets for our carbon neutrality
program and continued to work towards our ambitious sustainability goals. I’m also proud that we
made significant progress in our diversity, equity, and inclusion strategy, particularly with the
creation of employee resource groups. Our women’s network – WISE – continues to go from
strength to strength and we created our LGBTQIA+ and allies’ network – STAND. Our Blossom
network, established three years ago to represent younger employees, is actively supported by a
growing number of executives, including our President and CEO. Horizon, our transformation
program to support ST’s growth ambition, has entered a new phase with the introduction of several
new ways of working to positively impact employee experience. We have also integrated the pillars
of our associated leadership model – smart, agile, bold, and engaged – into our performance
management to grow and develop competencies. I continue to believe that prioritizing and investing
in our people is crucial and helps us achieve our goals as one ST.
What factors will shape ST’s sustainability strategy in the future?
There are many factors that shape our sustainability strategy. We engage closely with all our
stakeholders to strictly monitor their needs and expectations. We are operating within an
increasingly complex and volatile environment, which presents many local and global challenges. To
address these, we aim to be agile, adapting our approach where necessary while remaining true to
our core beliefs and strategy.
We believe our technology can play a crucial role in addressing many of these challenges. It is our
goal to have a positive impact on society, while maintaining a proactive approach to mitigating the
impact of our operations as far as possible.

Stakeholder engagement
Regular engagement with internal and external stakeholders is essential to help us assess our
performance and meet expectations. By maintaining open communication and actively listening, we
can integrate feedback into our decision-making and evolve to create long-term value.
Our diverse range of stakeholders includes employees, customers, suppliers, investors,
communities, and industry associations. To help us work towards common goals, we collaborate
through a broad range of channels across all levels of the Company. These vary across our sites
according to their size and activity and take into account cultural and language differences.
During the verification process for this report, external auditors interviewed three stakeholders (an
industrial partner, a think tank and an association on human rights) to gain valuable insights into
their views of ST. This helps us maintain a balanced perspective, assess the effectiveness of our
actions, and consider the views of our stakeholders going forward.

In 2023, ST’s Senior Director of Corporate Social Responsibility, Sheila D’Annunzio, was elected to
the board of directors of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), strengthening our longstanding
collaboration. The role will give us the opportunity to support the RBA in its drive for sustainable
value for workers, the environment, and business throughout the global electronics supply chain.
Further details of our memberships, collaborations, and engagements can be found atst.com  .
Sharing our values and vision
We organize numerous events and activities throughout the year, both formal and informal.
In May 2023, we organized ‘ST Sustainability Days’ at our Agrate site (Italy), to raise awareness of
our role and contribution to sustainability. A diverse range of stakeholders including partners,
customers, and students were hosted in our new 300mm manufacturing facility.
The event included product demonstrations, presentations, and panel discussions designed to
engage participants and build knowledge. Over 1,000 stakeholders attended, demonstrating our
commitment to actively pursuing sustainability together.
We value the different perspectives of our team members and encourage open dialog and honest
feedback. To ensure our employees feel informed and part of our community, we regularly share
news and updates throughout the Company. Our President and CEO provides official updates
through CEO calls and videos, while local news and events are published on our intranet and social
media channels. Throughout the year, we publish communication and awareness campaigns on a
wide range of topics, such as new training opportunities, sustainability initiatives, and employee
health and safety.

Business dynamics
In Automotive, we again saw strong demand across all geographies, driven by increasing
semiconductor pervasion and structural transformation. The year was also positively impacted by
inventory replenishment and a high level of capacity reservation fees.
In 2023, we continued to execute our strategy to support car
electrification. Our revenue for silicon carbide (SiC) products for the
year was US$1.14 billion, a growth of more than 60% versus 2022.
In car digitalization, we saw continued design win momentum, with
our latest generation of automotive microcontrollers across
applications such as software-defined vehicle architectures and car
electrification systems.
In Industrial, demand was still strong during 2023, especially in power and energy, factory
automation and robotics, and industrial infrastructure. Towards the end of Q3 we saw a progressive
weakening of demand, that accelerated during Q4. In power and energy management applications,
such as EV charging stations, renewable energy systems, and factory automation, we had a broad
range of design wins. We further strengthened our embedded processing solutions leadership with
our STM32 microcontroller and microprocessor families and related ecosystem, introducing many
new products and tools.
During the year, we had a strong focus on Edge AI. We announced
and provided updates on multiple hardware products, including
microcontrollers, microprocessors, and smart sensors. We unveiled
the world’s first MCU–Edge AI Developer Cloud and held our first
ST Edge AI Summit online, with over 2,000 attendees and
participation from many customers and partners. We also made
good progress with sensors for industrial applications, introducing new MEMS and optical sensors
suitable for industrial robotics and embedded vision applications.
In Personal Electronics and Computer Peripherals, market demand remained weak in 2023, while
Communications Equipment demand remained solid in our focus areas. In Personal Electronics, we
continued to be successful with our focused approach, winning sockets in flagship devices with
sensors, wireless charging, touch display controllers, and secure solutions.

Manufacturing
We continued to transform our manufacturing base in 2023 to enable our future growth and drive
enhanced profitability, with the expansion of our 300mm capacity and a strong focus on wide-
bandgap semiconductors.
In SiC, we continued to ramp our front-end device production at our Catania (Italy) and Singapore
facilities, and we increased back-end manufacturing capacity at our sites in Morocco and China. We
also started production at our new integrated SiC substrate manufacturing facility in Catania as a
significant step in our SiC vertical integration strategy.
As part of our SiC strategy, we announced a joint venture with Sanan Optoelectronics for high-
volume 200mm SiC device manufacturing in China. Production is expected to start in Q4 2025.
These are important moves to further scale our global SiC manufacturing operations and they will
be key enablers of the opportunity we see to reach above US$5 billion SiC yearly revenues by 2030.
We also advanced with our 300mm capacity expansion plans. At our Agrate site (Italy), our new
300mm wafer fab was qualified for production and capacity of slightly more than 1,000 wafers per
week was installed as planned.
In June, we announced the conclusion of a three-party agreement among the State of France,
GlobalFoundries and our Company, as approved by the European Commission for a new 300mm
semiconductor manufacturing facility in Crolles.
All these initiatives are aligned with our sustainability strategy and our sustainable manufacturing
commitment, in terms of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, air, and water quality.
EU Taxonomy
On July 12, 2020, EU Regulation 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June
18, 2020 (EU Taxonomy Regulation) entered into force. The EU Taxonomy Regulation establishes
the basis for a classification system to determine which economic activities can be considered
environmentally sustainable. It is part of the EU’s efforts to achieve the objectives of the European
‘green deal’, Europe’s strategy towards climate neutrality in 2050. The EU Taxonomy Regulation is
designed as a transparency tool to help companies and investors make sustainable investment

Innovation ecosystem
ST’s innovation model is based on a balance between internal and external initiatives that guarantee
continuous capability to identify, develop, attract, absorb, and create innovation. In 2023, we
introduced an innovative network-based organization model based on the 3-3-3 approach:
The scouting network is led by innovation specialists nominated for their expertise. The system
streamlines our processes so we can work more efficiently towards potential collaborations. It also
allows us to conduct business and technical analysis to better understand potential synergies.
Fab labs are a crucial part of our innovation ecosystem. These are dedicated areas with the
technical resources to drive innovation. The labs help form local ecosystems by connecting ST
employees and technical communities with external innovators. In line with the ongoing expansion
of our global network of fab labs, we opened two new labs in 2023, in Le Mans (France) and Sophia
Antipolis (France), bringing the total to 13.
External partnerships
We recognize the importance of partnerships in the innovation process and build strategic alliances,
engage in bilateral research cooperation, and participate in standardization bodies. These bring
together industry leaders from along the value chain to accelerate innovation, mainly in the
automotive and industrial sectors, and diversify our scouting process in the smart mobility sector. In
2023, we were involved in 195 active R&D partnerships.
Throughout 2023, we continued to develop our program of external partnerships. To achieve this,
we improved the way we work with accelerators to recruit startups. ST also launched a new
initiative to attract and work with startups in France. In India, we launched a similar project with a

Clean production
We strive to reduce the impact of our manufacturing activities on natural resources by managing our
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, reducing our energy, water, and chemical consumption, and
recycling waste.
Low power products and sustainable usage
Reducing the power consumption of electronic devices is a major focus of our strategy, helping to
reduce our environmental footprint year after year. Yet our products go beyond power efficiency and
contribute in other ways to address environmental and social challenges (see ‘Considering our
product handprint’ below).
End of life recycling
We strive to ensure our products meet or exceed applicable
environmental requirements, such as REACH(1), RoHS(2), and HSPM
(3) (see Chemicals). ECOPACK processes and classification help us
monitor the substances used in our products, which in turn
facilitates end of life and recycling when our devices are disposed
of. By the end of 2023, 95% of our products exceeded RoHS
directives and were rated ECOPACK2 or ECOPACK3.
Considering our product handprint
As well as continually working on reducing our product footprint, we also strive to increase our
product handprint. Handprint refers to a positive impact on the system or the application in which
the product is integrated. This might be by enabling a green or social application, contributing to a
reduction in the footprint of the application, or by consuming less energy than current alternatives.
Jean-Louis Champseix
Group Vice President, Corporate
Sustainability
At ST, we view sustainability as a question of balance. We strive to reduce our
environmental footprint while increasing our product handprint with sustainable
technologies. By doing so, we enable our customers to create products that have a more
positive impact on the world. This approach supports our sustainable growth,
minimizing risks and creating long-term value for our stakeholders, as we move
towards a more responsible future.

Enabling green or social applications
Enabling the transition to planet-friendly alternatives, our semiconductor solutions are used in a
wide variety of environmental applications, from electric mobility and renewable energy grids to
smart industries. In addition, our products and technologies cater for a wide variety of human-
welfare applications with social benefits.
As an example, several ST products are indispensable for car electrification, such as traction
inverters and onboard chargers. (see ST products and solutions). In 2023, a collaborative smart
farm project was completed that uses ST chips and technical expertise for an air probe aimed at
optimizing efficiency and reducing GHG emissions.
Reducing power consumption
Thanks to specific product features, our products can significantly contribute to reducing power
consumption (and thus GHG emissions) of the application they are embedded in. For example, a
Time-of-Flight sensor embedded in a laptop with thePresence turnkey solution � �, can save a
significant amount of electricity by automatically switching to power saving mode when the laptop
is idle. This carbon saving exceeds by far the emissions generated by the production and use of the
chip itself. See focus, below, for another example.

A ZEST TO CREAA ZEST TO CREATE POSITIVETE POSITIVE
ENVIR ENVIRONMENT ONMENTAL IMP AL IMPA ACT CT
In 2023, we launched ‘STM32 ZeST’ (zero
speed full torque), a new embedded
software that reduces electricity
consumption. When applied to a washing
machine, it can reduce electricity
consumption by at least 10%. This
represents approximately 110kWh of energy
saved over the lifespan of the machine. It is
a clear demonstration of product handprint, as the embedded device brings a
substantial positive environmental impact.
All ST devices required for the washing machine to operate, such as voltage
regulators, inverters, microcontrollers, converters, and diodes, generate carbon
emissions during their lifecycle. This is mainly due to manufacturing and use.
However, thanks to the ZeST, the handprint outweighs the carbon footprint, resulting
in a net positive impact.
Additionally, we use Edge AI (NanoEdge AI Studio) technology to estimate the weight
of the laundry to be washed, based on motor current measurements. We have
created a virtual sensor that determines the weight of the laundry using data already
available in the microcontroller that controls the motor. The washing machine can
then adjust its water consumption according to the actual load, reducing water
consumption.
This is not restricted to high-end washing machines. Since it does not require
additional devices to perform the function, it is accessible to mid-range appliances at
virtually no extra cost and can be deployed on a large scale.
Consuming less
Our Stellar automotive microcontrollers (MCUs) are an example of reduced energy consumption, as
they significantly improve the efficiency of cars (and therefore their energy consumption) and reduce
CO2 emissions. Stellar MCUs offer a reduced lifetime carbon footprint compared to previous-
generation MCUs. A case study was conducted using the body platforms of a major original
equipment manufacturer (OEM), to compare the emissions of a next-generation platform using
Stellar MCUs, with a current platform using current-generation MCUs.
The results showed that:
2027 sustainability goal Status Comments
SG2: Generate at least 33% of our revenues from our Sustainable
Technology’s most advanced responsible products by 2027. 23.2%
The manufacturing process for the Stellar device produced 40% less CO2 emissions compared
to the previous generation solution for the platform.
Over the lifetime of the vehicle, the CO2 emissions of the Stellar MCU solution were 30% lower
than the previous generation solutions, while maintaining the same level of performance.
Overall, the calculations revealed a significant reduction in CO2 emissions for the Stellar MCU
solution throughout the manufacturing and lifetime of the vehicle.

Unlocking value with sustainability
We value the voice of our stakeholders. In our materiality review in 2023, we focused on our
customers and their priorities. Therefore, we prepared a short survey that helped us identify,
evaluate, and prioritize the sustainability topics that best reflect our customers’ expectations.
Analysis showed that climate change is a high priority for our
customers. In 2020, we announced our commitment to becoming
carbon neutral by 2027 on scope 1 and 2, and partially scope 3. We
were the first semiconductor company to have near-term targets
validated by the science-based targets initiative (SBTi). Our carbon
neutrality roadmap gives us the opportunity to actively contribute to
our customers’ climate commitments and become the partner of
choice on this important journey.
Other priorities identified include water, circular economy, and chemicals, where we have many
established programs, as detailed in this report (see Water, Chemicals, and Waste).

In 2023, we continued our journey to ensure our products meet the highest quality and reliability
requirements of our customers, with a quality performance management model called ‘Strive for
excellence’.
‘STRIVE FOR EX‘STRIVE FOR EXCELLEN CELLENCE’ CE’
Our quality management program, ‘Strive for
excellence’, is designed to anticipate and
proactively achieve excellence, rather than
react to existing situations. It is implemented
in three-year cycles, based on five strategic
pillars:
We have established a project management office to define the program structure,
choose and apply methodologies, and monitor objectives daily.
Between 2018 and 2023, we have seen significant improvements in quality indicators
such as defect rate, leading to lower product returns, confirming the effectiveness of
our approach. In 2023, we entered a new phase focused on consolidating our
achievements and strengthening our assets, processes, programs, and working
models, while remaining committed to our core pillars of design flow quality:
prevention, detection, and innovation. We have also enhanced our network of
experts and invested in digitalization and data analytics to drive our ambitions of
excellence further.
Moving forward, we will continue to focus on quality prevention measures through R&D and new
product development, investing in leadership and expertise, and digitally transforming our quality
processes to improve prediction, prevention, and detection. By continually improving our quality
processes and investing in our people, we believe we can better serve our customers and drive
customer satisfaction.

Maintaining close relationships at all levels
To maintain an even closer relationship with our customers, in 2023, we created sustainability
functions in Sales and Marketing to support our customers in achieving their sustainability
strategies.
Working with teams from across ST, including representatives from Sales, Logistics, Technical
Support, and Quality, enables us to develop a deeper understanding of our customers, their internal
processes, and their preferences. It also helps to increase trust and satisfaction. We work to build
close relationships between ST executives and key customer executives, further strengthening trust
and satisfaction at the highest levels.
Relationships with smaller customers are managed by the ST distribution partner network. This
comprises ST personnel and distribution partners from across the globe. Network personnel
regularly visit customers to assess opportunities, present our product portfolio, and support them in
their product design and development.
Collecting customer feedback on our performance
We collect feedback on our performance during our interactions with customers. Feedback may be
communicated informally during meetings or phone calls, or it may be provided formally via a
scorecard. Each customer scorecard is closely reviewed so the various components of the
performance evaluation (such as technology, delivery, sustainability, and quality) can be analyzed
and communicated to the appropriate functions within ST.
We make these scorecards and customer feedback available via our ‘Vivavoce’ internal portal,
visible to all organizations within ST. This visibility provides each organization with customer
feedback on its performance, helping to drive continuous improvement.

Promoting employee health
We believe adopting a healthy lifestyle is fundamental for an engaged and productive workforce. To
support our employees, our various sites design health programs adapted to local legislation and
requirements. Many sites offer regular medical check-ups and vaccinations. We take a preventive
approach and also offer blood analyses, x-rays, and cancer screening, among other things, to
facilitate early detection of illnesses.
To further support employees, our various sites offer targeted health initiatives or awareness
campaigns. For example, our Catania site (Italy) ran a two-year voluntary health plan between 2021
and 2023 focusing on medical evaluation to prevent metabolic syndrome, a cluster of conditions
that can lead to heart disease, diabetes and other serious illnesses. Nearly 2,000 employees
participated in the program, which led to new diagnosis of conditions such as type 2 diabetes and
high cholesterol. It also led to greater awareness and acknowledgement of non-critical health
indicators.
At our Muar site (Malaysia), regular doctor-led health seminars are organized as part of the health
program. Topical issues are covered, such as a presentation on nasopharyngeal cancer, focusing on
early detection and treatment of the disease.
Well-being
In 2020, we launched our STCare program to support the well-being of our employees. We take a
proactive approach and have implemented measures to reduce risk and assist our people. Every
quarter, we monitor four key metrics globally and regionally to ensure they meet our defined
standards of acceptability:
To provide additional support we partnered with Eutelmed, a healthcare platform which provides
24/7 access to dedicated confidential assistance. Nearly 16,000 connections to the platform have
been registered since it opened in 2020. A network of over 300 psychologists and other specialists
is also available to employees and their families.
We have taken practical steps to promote employee well-being across our sites. This includes e-
learning for employees and managers, and prevention and well-being webinars and workshops on a
range of topics. In total, more than 4,500 managers have attended awareness sessions on
psychosocial risk prevention and quality of life in the workplace since 2021. In 2023, almost
2,500 employees completed self-assessment evaluations which have helped them gain a better
understanding of their well-being and take appropriate actions where necessary.
In 2023, we created a well-being index to gain insights into employee well-being and productivity
across our sites. This tool enables sites to assess themselves and identify areas for improvement. It
is based on 10 criteria including working environment, people, culture, working time, and workload
management. Going forward, we intend to organize sharing sessions to promote best practices and
raise awareness of relevant topics.

PREVENTINPREVENTING RISKS FORG RISKS FOR
CONSTRUCTION WCONSTRUCTION WORKERS ORKERS
Many of our sites have ongoing construction
work which has led to an increase in
contractors on site. Our sites have adapted
their procedures accordingly to prioritize
communication, knowledge transfer, and
awareness.
At our Crolles site (France), the annual safety
week was attended by over 1,000 ST
employees and over 700 subcontractors, the highest number to date. Events were
tailored to this demographic and included activities led by safety, medical, and fire
teams, along with interactive sessions to cut risks on construction sites.
Our Kirkop site (Malta), introduced a new contractor management system for health
and safety auditing. Under the new system, ST personnel conduct daily audits to
assess the level of vigilance among contractors. The new system allows information
to be digitally registered. This facilitates instant access to data, which can also be
accurately communicated to health and safety managers on site. Where necessary,
additional preventive measures can be put in place to reduce the hazards and
potential risks related to construction work.
At our Shenzhen site (China), a contractor management system has been
implemented to improve communication on the site. This includes daily ‘toolbox
meetings’ conducted for contractors by EHS or facility guardians. A safety
dashboard is updated on a weekly basis and shared with all construction project
owners.
Overall, our efforts to improve contractor management and safety demonstrate our
commitment to ensuring a safe working environment.
Monitoring our performance
Everyone at ST is part of our shared vigilance approach and has a responsibility towards safety at
work. To demonstrate visible involvement and lead by example, managers are encouraged to
conduct regular safety visits and inspections. In 2023, we continued to improve our training for
managers and offered coaching on conversation skills. This aimed to improve safety-related
communications through positive reinforcement and by building engagement.
We also implemented more ambitious targets for site visits and
internal audits. As a result, the number of safety field visits by
managers increased to 57,400, a 17% increase on the previous
year. We also increased the number of evacuation drills, which
involved 92% of ST employees worldwide and 97% of employees
at front-end and back-end manufacturing sites.
We encourage the reporting and investigation of near-misses, hazards, and unsafe behaviors and
conditions as part of our proactive approach. Due to increased visits and investigations by
managers, as well as improved hazard identification, more than 45,800 potential hazards were
detected and investigated in 2023. It is our aim to conduct thorough, structured, and objective
investigations for all incidents and share best practice responses across our sites.
To recognize the efforts of our sites, we held our third Safety, Environment and Corporate Social
Responsibility awards ceremony in 2023. Our Shenzhen site (China) and Crolles site (France) won
the safety awards for consistently pursuing effective prevention programs and strong teamwork
dedicated to enhancing safety on site.

Advancing our practices
ST’s Safety First program was launched in 2013 based on the principle that 90% of accidents can
be avoided. We believe safety is a value that must never be compromised. This commitment is
endorsed throughout the Company and was renewed by senior management in 2023.
Within this program, we constantly strive to strengthen our safety culture by reinforcing safe
behaviors and working conditions through visits, training, audits, communication, and best practice
sharing. This year we provided an average of 6.7 hours of training per employee on EHS topics.
In addition, each year we organize numerous safety events across our sites that are open to all employees.
These include safety weeks and diverse activities to promote continuous improvement. The overall aim is
to raise awareness, explore new ideas, and share best practices, with a focus on prevention.
In 2023, our sites recognized world day for safety and health at work, an international celebration endorsed
by the United Nations. Our sites in Japan organized an event focused on disaster prevention and
emergency response, with the support of an external speaker. Similarly, our Ang Mo Kio site (Singapore)
conducted a range of health and safety activities, including a chemical prevention workshop and personal
protection equipment showcase. In Rousset (France), screen savers were an effective reminder to
employees to prioritize good posture, with ergonomics workshops also supporting the initiative.
As part of our disaster prevention program, members of the emergency response team at our
Kirkop site (Malta) received a minimum of 30 hours training from fire fighters to equip them with
‘first-level preparedness’ on site for emergency situations. This included laying and using fire hoses,
controlling real fires, and a search and rescue operation in challenging conditions.
We actively search for new and innovative methods to promote a strong safety culture and bring
new meaning to our safety initiatives. In 2023, we used drama and theatre techniques as a learning
tool. Actors helped simulate real-life scenarios, humanize safety messages, and bring a fresh
perspective to a serious topic. At our Crolles site (France), the ‘nudge’ theory, a strategy that
influences behavior was introduced. Nudges were used to improve traffic circulation on site and
promote safe behavior within the building for employees and visitors alike.

As part of our Labor and Human Rights
Procedure update, we have enhanced
parental leave protection across ST. Since
May 2023, on joining the Company every
female employee has the right to 14 weeks
of fully paid maternity leave, including at
least six weeks of compulsory postnatal
leave. We also provide the second parent
with at least two weeks of fully paid parental leave. Family structures have been
evolving for some time and we recognize that paid parental leave must encompass a
broad spectrum of parenthood. In line with our policy of non-discrimination, we
provide fully paid parental leave in cases of adoption and surrogacy.
We are also committed to safeguarding parental rights and benefits by:
These requirements also contribute to our diversity, equity and inclusion strategy and
goals (see Diversity, equity and inclusion). More information on our new parental
leave protections can be found in our Labor and Human Rights Procedure.
Identifying and assessing adverse human rights
impacts
Our risk assessment processes are deployed at our major sites (700+ employees and/or
manufacturing sites). They support the identification and assessment of actual or potential adverse
human rights impacts for 89% of our workforce.
Risk assessments are undertaken using several methods, including:
strengthened labor agency due diligence
enhanced parental leave policy (see focus)
maximum threshold for training fee reimbursement requests, when relevant
emphasis on the right to equal pay and adequate social protection
adapted work environment for workers with medical conditions and disabilities
providing full protection from dismissal during parental leave
emphasizing the right to return to work in the same or equivalent position and pay
requiring our sites to define and implement local carer’s benefits for people with
caring responsibilities
guaranteeing that women on maternity leave receive at least the average increase
given to employees on the site or country in a given year
a corporate assessment of the inherent risks related to our activities and locations
site-specific assessments to identify the labor and human rights risks associated with local
operations at our major sites
RBA human rights self-assessment questionnaires (SAQs). In 2023, our sites scored from 73.7/

These tools are complemented by two audit programs covering up to 80% of our workforce. In
addition to this, we also have a program of audits covering our suppliers and subcontractors. (For
more information, seeResponsible supply chain).
RBA audit program
RBA third-party audits are conducted on a two-year basis at our 11 largest manufacturing sites. All
our manufacturing sites eligible for the RBA audit program were audited during 2022–23 (including
initial and closure audits).
In 2023, thanks to the continual efforts of our teams, five of our manufacturing sites obtained RBA
Platinum recognition with full compliance (200/200) during their initial audits:
These five scores complement the RBA Platinum recognition obtained in 2022 by our Calamba (the
Philippines), Ang Mo Kio (Singapore), and Agrate (Italy) sites during their initial audits and in 2021 by
our Muar site (Malaysia) during their closure audit.
Our Kirkop site (Malta) achieved RBA Platinum recognition during its last closure audit in 2021. The
site conducted its next initial audit in 2023, and received Gold recognition, exceeding the industry
average by 49 points.
Our Shenzhen site (China) obtained RBA Silver recognition during its closure audit in 2023,
exceeding the industry average by 6 points.
Our 2023 RBA audit average score exceeds the industry average by 55 points in initial audits and by

Labor and human rights (LHR) internal audit program
We conduct internal audits at least every three years on major ST sites. The LHR audit program
assesses alignment with ST’s Corporate Labor and Human Rights Procedure, as well as national,
regional, and local regulatory requirements. It enables us to proactively identify risks and
opportunities for improvement.
In 2023, we conducted two LHR internal audits. For this audit cycle, the areas identified for
improvement were related to management systems and labor issues such as working hours,
overtime rates, days off, and housing standards.
Preventing and mitigating impacts on human rights
We continually develop and implement measures to prevent or mitigate any adverse impacts
identified through our risk assessment tools. Corrective action plans (CAPs) are established to close
any gaps between local practices and ST’s human rights standards.
CAPs identify and address root causes and aim to prevent any recurrence of identified adverse
impacts by:
CAPs may include policy or procedure changes, communication or training, and impact
measurements.
In 2023, we implemented a range of preventive and remediation actions.
Description Actions implemented
Risk assessment • Extension of labor and human rights risk assessment to smaller sites.
Reporting of violations and promise of
non-retaliation
• Enhanced communication on grievance mechanisms, including posters,
roundtables, and informative sessions, including with supervisors.
• Design of checks, including post-meeting questionnaires to verify the
effectiveness of the communication channels implemented.
Prevention of underage (child) labor
and protection of young workers
• Update of local policies and implementation and check of procedures to ensure
full overview and verification of all workers’ ages before entering the premises.
Awareness of RBA standards and
workers’ rights
• Design and implementation of tools to communicate and address questions from
employees on social responsibility standards.
Alongside CAPs, we provide labor and human rights training to raise awareness among employees
and suppliers. ST’s commitments in this regard emphasize compliance with the policies and
standards mentioned above.I 409-1 I
In addition, any labor and human rights concerns from internal and external stakeholders can be
reported through an independent multilingualSpeak Up Hotline  . Cases are handled with the

Tracking effectiveness and performance monitoring
We continually monitor and review our sites’ and suppliers’ performance by tracking CAPs to
measure and improve their effectiveness in addressing adverse human rights impacts. Corrective
actions must be identified and implemented within 12 months. Audit and CAP updates are followed
up and shared with sites quarterly.
ST sites’ social performances are monitored every quarter through specific reporting tools, such as
working hours and leave reports. We also regularly monitor and review site performance against
specific objectives and targets. These are included in the personal objectives of the site

Revitalizing our employer value proposition (EVP)
In mid-2023, we launched a project to refresh and reinvigorate our EVP , to support our ambitious
growth goals, to build awareness of these goals with our target talent market, and to enhance our
attraction and retention strategies.
We started with primary research:
The objective was to discover insights from across the globe and build a 360° view of the
organization. This initial discovery phase allowed us to ensure alignment with ST’s current
transformation. It also ensures we continue to align the internal reality with the EVP messaging to
manage external market expectations and showcase what makes ST different from our competitors.
The aim is to develop a consistent and accurate portrayal of what it is like to work at ST – and why
people should choose to join us.
To help attract talent, our people act as ST ambassadors during
external events, such as campus fairs, job fairs, and conferences,
as well as on social media. ST ambassadors share their experience
as employees, showcasing our opportunities and promoting ST as
a great place to work.
In 2023, we continued to build strategic partnerships with universities and engineering schools
throughout the world to ensure a robust and healthy pipeline of candidates, while also establishing
education pathways to respond to our specific skills needs. During the year, we collaborated with 53
strategic academic partners globally and over 250 sourcing partners.
We also launched the ‘ST student job world tour’, a series of video testimonials from interns and
graduates who have experienced working at ST. The videos aim to inspire future talent by
demonstrating the diverse career paths we offer.

In 2023, we launched the ‘ST student job
world tour’ as an innovative approach to
attracting and retaining talent. The series
features video testimonials from interns and
graduates who have gained practical
experience at ST through internships, PhDs,
and other opportunities. The videos provide
a glimpse into their daily life at ST and offer
a chance to explore various aspects of the
Company’s culture. Participants from many countries and regions, including France,
Italy, India, Singapore, China, the USA, and Switzerland have contributed to the
series.
The student job world tour is designed to engage a diverse group of students,
including internal and external candidates from different backgrounds, genders, and
roles. It also showcases the different career paths available at ST and our Company’s
commitment to diversity and inclusion. The videos are available on our intranet and
social media, allowing prospective candidates to gain a deeper understanding of ST
and envision a career with us.
Developing and supporting our talent pool
We aim to offer our diverse workforce a rewarding career experience, providing flexible
opportunities for growth and development, as well as transparent processes for advancement and
progression.
To support this ambition and build on our progress in recent years, we established a new center of
excellence for end-to-end talent management in 2023 to engage, empower, and enable our
workforce. We also launched a new performance management approach to bring greater objectivity
and consistency to how we recognize and reward performance. This is supported by 300 regional
change ambassadors and dedicated training for more than 4,000 people managers.
Each year, we have a goal setting process for employees, followed by a mid-year goal review. This
helps ensure that objectives are clear, relevant, and achievable. We have incorporated the pillars of
our leadership model into this process to encourage employees to demonstrate these behaviors in
their work. Performance is evaluated annually. To complement this, we have implemented a
‘continuous individual feedback for development’ program. This provides an efficient way to help
employees progress and offers a collaborative and holistic approach to team management.
In parallel, we are continuing our journey to digitize the talent experience, including the processes
around recruitment, onboarding, learning, and development.
2023 involved a focused effort to build knowledge and awareness of our new leadership model,
which helps to frame the expectations of leaders across the organization, including more than
40,000 employees participating in relevant awareness and development sessions.
We also accelerated our rollout of digital learning solutions covering
a mix of themes from diversity, equity and inclusion to leadership
development and technical and engineering topics. Our approach
included internally developed e-learning (34,700 employees
engaged) and leveraged growing partnerships with external
providers, such as LinkedIn Learning (12,300 employees engaged)
and Coursera (1,000 employees engaged). Overall, we delivered
more than 88,000 digital learning hours across the organization.
When considering our entire development portfolio, we provided an average of 49 training hours per
person in 2023.

Our commitment to embed the leadership model and support succession planning was further
enhanced through coaching activities. This included the delivery of 158 individual coaching
programs, with female participation boosted through our ‘Advanced Women in Leadership’ and
‘Coach Her’ initiatives. In addition, 36 ‘Team Up’ team coaching sessions were delivered to foster
collaboration and improve organizational alignment.
In our 2023 succession planning process, we extended our efforts to cover all senior management,
going beyond the president and executive vice president roles. We are now well placed to focus on
business continuity, further grow the succession pipeline, and foster a culture of growth and career
development.
Achieving the full potential of our people
Listening to our employees
As our employees are at the heart of our success, listening to their feedback and input is essential
to evaluate progress towards our transformation and growth.
Our 2023 employee survey consisted of 75 questions covering key
categories including engagement, organizational agility, quality, and
customer focus. The global participation rate was 87% of
employees and the overall engagement index was 86%. This is an
increase of three points on 2021 (when our last full engagement
survey was conducted), and one point above the Global High
Performance(1) Benchmark (75th percentile score).
Overall, we saw positive trends in most categories, including organizational alignment, direct
manager support, and employee experience. In particular, the results showed a six-point increase in
‘receiving feedback that helps me improve my performance’ and 87% of employees ‘would
recommend ST as a great place to work’, four points higher than 2021.
We regard the survey as a critical source of information to identify opportunities to better
understand and meet the needs of our evolving workforce. We have embarked on an action-
planning process across regions and functions to ensure we analyze and understand the vital input
it provides.
Once again, in 2023 we were independently awarded ‘Top Employer 2024’ in both Italy and France
by the Top Employers Institute.
Considering the voice of the younger generation
By the end of 2023, over half of our employees belonged to generations Y and Z, and by the end of
2025, they will represent 75% of our workforce. It is crucial to listen to their perspectives to enhance
employee experience and make ST an attractive and engaging place to work. With this in mind, we
launched our ‘Blossom’ program three years ago to enable younger employees to voice their
opinions, offer their ideas, be creative, and share their expectations.
In 2023, the Blossom network successfully organized 56 events. This included 14 meetings between
groups of ‘Blossomers’ from around the world and our President and CEO, as well as 23 meetings
with ST Presidents and Executive Vice Presidents. These regular exchanges between the
Blossomers and senior management are crucial for ST as they allow our leaders to gain a better
understanding of the expectations of generations Y and Z. This, in turn, helps us take follow-up
actions to keep these generations engaged, as they are the future leaders of our Company.
During the year, Fabio Gualandris, President of Quality, Manufacturing, and Technology, met with
Blossomers during his site visits to several countries, including France, Italy, and China. These visits
provided open discussion and feedback on various aspects of the organization. As a result of these
discussions, an action plan was launched, targeting key areas such as careers, collaboration, and
innovation. We plan to incorporate the feedback received from Blossomers into concrete actions
that will help us continue to improve and grow as a company.

Enhancing quality of life at work
We believe that hybrid work can improve quality of life and help us to attract and retain talent. We
have introduced a company-wide framework for flexible working arrangements. This allows
employees to work from home or other locations, in accordance with local regulations.
We understand the importance of supporting the well-being of our employees. Our STCare
program, among other initiatives, offers a range of resources which help promote a healthy work-life
balance (seeHealth and safety).
In addition, we have introduced a new parental leave policy which supports new families and
protects their rights (seeLabor and human rights).
Compensation and reward
Our compensation and benefits policy is a critical part of our employee value proposition,
supporting our growth and recognizing the contribution of our people.
We offer a short-term incentive scheme to almost 23,000 employees. As well as rewarding
operational performance, it also recognizes the achievement of our sustainability objectives through
a dedicated sustainability index focusing on four of our priorities:
The same sustainability index applies to every ST employee, including senior management.
The sustainability index is also one of the three criteria for our long-term incentive (performance
stock awards) scheme. In 2023, we increased the number of beneficiaries in our long-term
incentives scheme by more than 1,300, to include more young and entry-level talent.
Appreciation and recognition
In 2023, we celebrated the 30th edition of the ST Annual Recognition (STAR) awards, recognizing
more than 2,000 employees. This edition of the awards fully reflected our leadership model, with the
creation of a leadership award and the inclusion of leadership criteria in several award categories.
Innovation being essential for us, we also celebrated our Innovation awards, which recognize three
categories of innovative achievements: extraordinary competitive advantage patents, high potential
inventions, and technical papers.

With over 50,000 people from more than 120 nationalities and 40 countries, ST is a global company
working together as one team. We are convinced that diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) have a
positive impact on innovation and stakeholder engagement, as well as personal and Company
growth.I 3-3 I
Accelerating our cultural transformation
DEI maturity assessment
Our DEI vision is, “At ST, you can be the true version of yourself”. To help us achieve this, we
accelerated our efforts towards a cultural transformation of the Company in 2023.
Changing behaviors and culture takes time. An important step in this journey is to understand our
baseline and build a roadmap with clearly defined actions and milestones.
At the beginning of 2023, we received the results of our first DEI maturity assessment. This was
conducted by an external firm, specialized in DEI analytics and advice. The DEI maturity
assessment was a holistic process that included:
We believe diversity
enables innovation
and stakeholder
engagement, as well
as personal and
company growth.

Findings and actions
The detailed report and recommendations from the DEI assessment
were shared with respective program owners, with an action plan
and agreed timelines. Below, are some of the key findings included:
DEI index within our employee survey
Following our DEI pulse survey in 2022, we created a DEI index in our employee engagement
survey. The index is composed of several questions covering different dimensions of DEI, such as
discrimination, inclusion, equity, diversity, and belonging.
In line with our DEI vision, one of the statements respondents were asked to agree or disagree with
was “At ST, I don’t have to hide who I really am in order to be accepted.” In 2023, we achieved an
81% positive response rate for this statement, the same score as in 2022. We regard this as a
positive indicator of the solid foundations for creating a truly inclusive culture at ST.
The overall 2023 DEI index score for the Company was 77%, a slight decrease from the 78%
achieved in our 2022 focus survey. It is worth noting that the 2022 DEI focus survey had a 67%
response rate, while the employee engagement survey had a significantly higher response rate of
87%.
Going forward, the DEI index will serve as a baseline to measure our progress and drive our
priorities.
Strengthening diversity
Diversity is an important pillar of our employer value proposition. Our ambition remains to attract,
recruit, and retain a diverse workforce by offering equitable and inclusive workplace opportunities,
including flexible working.
At the end of 2023, women represented 35% of our global workforce, 26% of our exempts(2) and
21% of our global STEM positions. In an under-represented technical field, we almost achieved our
target of hiring 30% women for exempt positions, falling just short at 29.2%.
Our target for 2025 is to increase the percentage of women at each management level to 20%. As
shown in the table below, we continue making progress, with each level of management gaining 1
percentage point. For the first time, we achieved an overall total of 20% of women in management
positions.
Our HR policies and processes are inclusive and in line with our
DEI goals, but we need to recognize the influence of
management culture on our DEI efforts. Additionally, the
assessment revealed that ST employees face similar challenges, regardless of whether or not
they belong to a minority. As a result, proactive steps have been taken to reinforce our efforts to
develop inclusion for all employees. 2024 will see an awareness campaign and dedicated DEI
events at organization and site level.
To overcome cultural barriers, the assessors felt that further alignment and awareness was
needed on ST’s position against misbehaviors such as sexism and microaggressions, for
example. One action we took to address this was the creation in 2023 of a worldwide taskforce
for preventing sexism. The taskforce built on the work done by ST France to reduce workplace
sexism: a series of educational videos and web conferences were launched, along with a poster
campaign and deployment of sexual harassment advisors at all our French sites.
Our hiring trend for women is progressing well, helping us move towards our target for the
representation of women in Company management. However, more efforts are needed when it
comes to promoting women. To address this, we established DEI scorecards for each
organization, including hiring and promotion rates, with assigned DEI objectives. Progress
towards the objectives is monitored on a quarterly basis.

We aim to create a diverse workforce that reflects society, including people with different abilities. In
2023, our sites in Singapore participated in a local government initiative called ‘SG Enable’, to hire
persons with disabilities in engineering positions. At the end of 2023, one employee with a disability
was successfully hired and integrated, with plans for more in 2024.
ST France launched a self-diagnosis tool to help people research their own potential disabilities
anonymously, and then be supported through the declaration process. This enabled over 450
people to learn more about their situation and the support available to help them make the most of
their working life at ST.
Growing equity
We value all employee contributions and have zero tolerance for any
kind of discrimination. Our objective is to safeguard equity in
development, career opportunities, and remuneration.
We monitor our gender pay ratio each quarter, comparing women's
and men's salaries by job level for each country where we operate.
At the end of 2023, we recorded an overall gender pay ratio of 99.2%(3). While the overall gap is
small, we identified some areas to focus on and the relevant regions and organizations are working
on closing these gaps.

New parental policy
We recognize that paid parental leave concerns all parents. Since May 2023, women are offered
14 weeks of fully paid maternity leave, with two weeks of fully paid leave for the second parent.
Paternity leave is crucial for supporting men’s care rights and responsibilities. Employees on
maternity leave receive at least the average salary increase given to employees at the site or in the
country that year (seeLabor and human rights).

Women in Leadership
program
Supporting women’s career development
We are committed to strengthening the role of women in building the future of our Company. To
support this, we have developed a two-step training program to prepare the next generation of
female leaders.
The program begins with Women in Leadership (WIL) training, targeted at junior and middle
management. The training focuses on becoming a confident, authentic leader and the importance of
building a network. In 2023, more than 100 women across all regions participated in 11 sessions.
Our Advanced Women in Leadership (AWIL) training, launched in
2021, is aimed at senior women managers and directors to help
them identify their leadership style and become more visible and
recognized within ST. It is a five-step blended learning training,
including a two-and-a-half-day workshop, individual coaching, self-
awareness, and a personal development plan. In 2023, we delivered
10 sessions across all regions, training 96 women in total.
This training program plays a key role in preparing a pipeline of women for executive management
positions within ST. Since 2015, we have delivered over 80 WIL and AWIL sessions, across all
regions, with more than 840 women benefitting from the training.
ST women have been increasingly active in the public sphere, presenting their work and
participating in panel discussions at a variety of high-profile events. At the 2023 RADECS European
Conference, ST sponsored a session dedicated to women in engineering where the chairperson and
panelists were ST women from our French sites. In 2023, ST also became an advocate sponsor for
the Women Leadership Initiative (WLI) organized by the Global Semiconductor Alliance. At WLI’s
flagship technical conference, Aradhana Kumari from our Greater Noida site (India) won the
prestigious Female Up and Comer Award (seeAwards 2023 overview). Frédérique Le Grevès, ST's
Executive Vice President Europe & France Public Affairs and President of STMicroelectronics
France, was chosen to chair the new IndustriELLES collective aimed at improving the place of
women in the industry.
Court case in France
In 2015, 10 employees in France took their case of gender discrimination related to salary and
career advancement in ST to the French court. After three years, the first instance judgement ruled
out any discrimination. However, in 2023, the court of appeal overturned the initial decision.
ST does not tolerate discrimination of any kind. All concerns raised are taken seriously and
investigated. If an allegation is confirmed actions are taken. (see Ethics and compliance, speak up
and misconduct reporting).
In terms of gender equality, ST has been taking proactive measures for many years, as outlined in
this article and in previous sustainability reports. However, we recognize that we have to continue
our efforts in creating a truly equitable and inclusive workplace. We remain committed to making
progress and ensuring that all employees are treated with respect and fairness.
Developing inclusion
Creating awareness
We aim to overcome stereotypes by continuously reinforcing an inclusive mindset that recognizes
the value and richness of a diverse workforce.
To help us achieve this, we provide two main training courses:
In 2023, over 8,000 employees completed the diversity, equity and inclusion e-learning course, a
36% increase from 2022. This increase was mainly thanks to strong support from the presidents of
each organization within ST.

unconscious bias workshops

Page 91:
2,100+
people trained on
unconscious bias
More than 2,100 employees from all regions where we operate
participated in unconscious bias workshops in 2023. The workshop
is supported by a team of more than 60 internal trainers. During
these workshops, participants explore how their own unconscious
bias and micro-behaviors can impact their decision-making and
learn how to be more attentive and mindful when interacting with
others.
Following the transgender inclusion guide for employees we published last year, in 2023 we
developed a user guide for HR personnel and managers, as part of our commitment to ensuring a
safe, equitable, and inclusive environment for everyone. The guide contains procedures for
navigating HR systems for name and gender change. It also contains a list of recommendations
relating to dress code, restrooms, and how to communicate these changes sensitively.
Employee resource groups (ERGs)
In 2023, we established a strong focus on setting up ERGs to promote inclusion in the workplace.
These are voluntary, employee-led groups of people belonging to a minority or having a shared
characteristic. The aim of the ERGs is to provide a safe space for members to share their
experiences and challenges, help leaders understand what matters to these employees, and to
support their professional development.
In less than one year, our first ERG for women – WISE (Women Inspiring Supporting and
Empowering) – has strengthened its reach and taken on some important projects.
WISE ER WISE ERG FOR W G FOR WOMEN OMEN
The WISE community is growing fast, with
some1,400+ members in 60 locations.
Sponsored by Frédérique Le Grevès, ST's
Executive Vice President Europe & France
Public Affairs and President of
STMicroelectronics France, and Steve Rose,
President Legal Counsel and Public Affairs,
more and more allies and local sponsors are
playing a key role in this network.
Since its launch in 2023, 26 WISE local networks and 44 local ambassadors have
been appointed worldwide, with each defining their own local WISE roadmap.
A shadowing program, Discov’HER, was launched to raise awareness of different
career paths in ST. Several women volunteered to talk about their role in ST, their
professional journey, and their day-to-day responsibilities and activities.
Additionally, many roundtables and webcasts were organized at a global level to
enhance the discussion around important topics, such as work-life balance or career
evolution, and highlight the stories of ST’s inspiring women and allies.
Following the success of a webinar on LGBTQIA+ inclusion in the workplace, we launched an ERG
for this community with sponsors from our top management. The webinar and taskforce creation
were done in collaboration with Têtu Connect, a think tank specializing in LGBTQIA+ issues. The
governing committee is currently preparing a roadmap and a number of activities are planned for
2024.

Inclusive communication guidelines
We recently released internal inclusive communication guidelines. We believe our language and
visuals shape attitudes as to what is considered normal and acceptable. Inclusive communication
goes beyond avoiding offensive words and includes non-stereotypical, unbiased, and gender-
neutral language, as well as proper acknowledgment of people and cultures.

From the start of our collaboration, STMicroelectronics showed great commitment
towards the inclusion of LGBTQIA+ people in the workplace. At management level,
there was strong support for employees to build an ERG which reflects their diversity
and ways of life. It was very enriching and a pleasure to help this group of talented and
committed people successfully launch their initiative.

At ST, we provide semiconductor solutions that play an important role in helping to solve
environmental and social challenges. At the same time, our operations require natural resources and
can have a negative impact on the environment if not managed properly. For 30 years, protecting
the planet has been a priority. We have worked consistently to minimize our overall environmental
footprint and are committed to reaching carbon neutrality by 2027.
Driving environmental efficiency
Policy and governance
We always strive to conduct our business in a responsible manner. In 1993, we established our first
global environmental policy (seewww.st.com � �). Our sustainability charter (www.st.com/
sustainabilitycharter � �) supports this policy by outlining our commitments and goals for 2025
and 2027.
Our approach to the environment is incorporated into our
Company strategy and is led by our executive management
team. The corporate environmental team is responsible for
developing programs and procedures that enable us to work
towards our environmental objectives. These are implemented by
local sustainability committees, each of which develops a
roadmap according to the needs of their respective sites.
Our manufacturing sites each have an Environment, Health and
Safety (EHS) steering committee responsible for implementing
the environmental policy. The steering committee includes
representatives from facilities, production, human resources, and
We are committed to
managing our
business operations
in an

necessary.
Managing our performance
ST’s environmental management system is aligned with international standards, including
ISO14001, ISO50001, ISO14064, and EMAS(1). Our performance and management systems are
evaluated annually through third-party surveillance audits, and our certifications are renewed every
three years. Our major manufacturing sites are all certified (see ISO certificates available at
www.st.com ).
As part of our culture of continuous improvement, we conduct internal audits every three years. In
2023, we conducted internal audits at nine sites.
We also operate a program of third-party EHS legal compliance audits at 41 sites every three years.
These assess the sites’ compliance status and limit risks related to our license to operate. The
program covers all our manufacturing sites, all sites with more than 100 employees, and some
smaller sites and warehouses.
Monitoring progress
We benchmark our progress in environmental performance against multiple indicators, including
resource consumption, waste, and air emissions.
All our environmental data is collected
centrally and reported regularly (monthly,
quarterly, and yearly) on our environmental
database. Tracking the progress of each
indicator enables sites to continually adjust
and improve their performance. The results
and insights we gather are shared with all
teams during quarterly environment steering
committee meetings.
Since 2001, we have used our ‘eco-footprint
radar’ tool to analyze data on the inputs and
outputs of our manufacturing operations. The
smaller the eco-footprint, the better the performance, with a score of 1.0 or below considered good.
It allows us to compare the environmental impact of each manufacturing site, as well as our overall
progress. We analyze the results to identify potential improvements and define the priorities we
need to address. In 2023, our eco-footprint score was 0.73, better than our target of 0.75.I 3-3 I

At ST, we continue to make good progress towards our environmental goals. However,
we recognize that the challenges faced by the semiconductor industry are best
addressed through collaboration. I’m a member of various industry organizations that
facilitate the exchange of knowledge and best practices among experts globally. This
broad perspective benefits ST, and shapes strategic decisions in the wider industry,
helping us all move towards our environmental objectives.

USE OF SUSTUSE OF SUSTAIN AINABLE R ABLE RA AW W
MA MATERIALS TERIALS
Semiconductor companies use various raw
materials, including silicon, copper,
aluminum, and rare earth elements, to
manufacture high-tech products. These
materials are essential for the performance
of electronic devices. However, their
availability is at risk due to resource scarcity,
environmental impacts associated with
mining, as well as geopolitical and economic challenges. To reduce reliance on
certain materials and promote sustainable sourcing practices, they can sometimes
be replaced with alternative, more sustainable raw materials. These are secondary
raw materials, which are obtained through the recycling process.
ST recognizes the benefits of replacing critical and virgin raw materials with
sustainable alternatives. To achieve this, we adopt a holistic circular economy
approach to encourage innovation. Our Marcianise site (Italy) implemented an
innovative process to use alternative materials in certain less complex products,
such as smart cards. The ‘eco-friendly cards’ project uses recycled polyvinyl
chloride (PVC), from PVC waste that would otherwise have to be disposed of. It also
uses high density polyethylene reclaimed from oceans or beach environments.
In 2023, we established a workstream dedicated to responsible solutions, including
circularity, within our ‘accelerating sustainability together’ program. We are currently
building a roadmap to accelerate circularity and the use of sustainable raw materials
in our products.

Reducing our direct emissions
Our direct emissions, as defined by scope 1 of the GHG Protocol, represent more than 50% of our
total GHG emissions.
The use of perfluorinated compounds (PFC) in the manufacture of semiconductors accounts for a
significant share of our direct air emissions, as defined by scope 1 of the GHG protocol. It is
therefore a central part of our environmental strategy to reduce their use and ensure they are treated
appropriately before being released into the atmosphere. In 2023, we installed and activated
53 new PFC abatement systems in several of our sites. Our Ang Mo Kio site (Singapore) installed
18 additional abatement systems to reduce PFCs. Abatement systems were also installed across
multiple other sites: 12 in Catania (Italy), 11 in Agrate (Italy), 10 in Crolles (France) and 2 in Tours
(France).
In 2023, we updated our methodology to calculate GHG emissions from PFC use. We adopted the
2019 refinement to the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories to align with the
World Semiconductor Council’s recommendation of May 2023. The updated methodology along
with an increase in our production, have resulted in a 2% increase in our scope 1 direct emissions
reported in absolute values. Due to the change in methodology, our PFC emissions per unit of
production remained stable, despite the installation of new PFC abatement systems.

Among the methodologies proposed, ST decided to adopt theTier 2c method based
on over ten thousand data sets supplied to the IPCC working group by companies
and suppliers. It was selected due to its precision and greater scope. It considers
how gases are used in different processes and the by-products created. The new
method also has rules for emissions reduction technologies which need to be tested
and certified to meet certain standards and avoid the formation of other harmful
gases.
The revised method is now used in all our front-end manufacturing sites and helps us
to generate more robust data for our direct emissions. The system also provides
enhanced transparency and increased comparability, which will allow us to improve
our decision-making.
Investing in energy saving
In 2023, our absolute energy consumption increased by 7% compared to 2022. This was due to an
increase in the use of advanced manufacturing technologies, some of which have a higher
manufacturing footprint, but the devices produced consume less energy in the end application.
Despite this, we decreased our energy consumption per unit of production by 17% compared to
2016, in line with our 2025 goal of a 20% reduction.
All our manufacturing sites develop initiatives to optimize their energy consumption. At the end of
2023, thanks to energy savings and projects to reduce CO2 emissions, our annual energy saving
was approximately 139GWh, comprising 115GWh of electricity and 24GWh of methane gas,
compared to 112GWh in 2022. This is in line with our objective to save at least 150GWh per year by
2027.I 302-4 I
In 2023, our sites continued to implement a number of energy-saving initiatives. At our Ang Mo Kio
site (Singapore), a program was initiated to replace older auxiliary vacuum pumps with more
efficient models. The project saved 2.2GWh in 2023 and the same equipment has since been
upgraded at the majority of front-end manufacturing sites. Additionally, our Rousset site (France)
completed a project to retrofit 27 scrubbers, resulting in a saving of 3.0GWh and 600 metric tons of
CO2.
To explore ways to achieve further energy savings, ST collaborated with EDF DALKIA to conduct
assessments across all French sites. As a result of this initiative, our Crolles site (France)
implemented adiabatic cooling towers to cool air compressors. This method uses evaporation to
cool water and is more efficient than traditional chillers. The initiative resulted in an energy saving of
0.9GWh in 2023.
In addition, we focused on implementing technical best practices for designing, constructing, and
revamping our systems. This delivered immediate benefits with practically no additional costs,
contributing significantly to our total energy savings.
We also worked with energy-saving experts to identify other potential actions that could be
implemented in France and Italy between 2025 and 2027. These will help us reach our targets for
2027 and make further progress towards our sustainability goals.
Using renewable energies
Electricity counts for 92% of the energy we use. Renewable
sources provided 71% of the electricity we purchased in 2023,
compared to 62% in 2022. Green sourcing helped us avoid the
equivalent of 636,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions, largely by
purchasing more green electricity certificates.
In 2023, ST signed a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with ERG for the supply of
renewable electricity to our sites in Italy. The agreement will cover our two high-volume
manufacturing sites in Agrate and Catania, as well as multiple R&D, design, and sales and
marketing sites. The PPA will provide approximately 250GWh of renewable energy per year from
Sicilian wind farms, equivalent to a total volume of 3.75TWh over 15 years.
107 ST 2024 Sustainability report

Page 108:


As part of our move towards more renewable energy sourcing, our Bouskoura site (Morocco) has a
PPA for the electricity produced by 12 wind turbines. In 2023, these turbines supplied 47% of the
power used by the site, avoiding around 31,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions.
In 2022, the site extended its 4,000m2 photovoltaic carport with an additional 3,100m2 of solar
panels. The installation supplied more than 1.9GWh of electricity in 2023, which partially powers the
site’s cleanroom.
Similarly, solar power installations at our site in Catania (Italy) produced 1.8GWh of green electricity.
The photovoltaic carport installed at our Grenoble site (France) started to generate power in
December 2022. The 10,900m2 of solar panels will produce 2.7GWh of electricity annually, from
2024.
Solar and wind PPAs will play a major role in our transition to 100% renewable electricity by 2027.
Cross-functional teams have continued to work on our energy procurement strategy. Our ambition is
to identify new-build project opportunities which meet ‘additionality’ criteria. This means selecting
projects that bring new capacity into the grids in locations where we operate. To achieve this, we
will initiate strategic and long-term partnerships.
Minimizing our indirect emissions from transportation
From 15 material topics defined in scope 3 of the GHG Protocol, we have selected three areas to
report where we can maximize our impact:
Goods transportation accounts for 49% of our scope 3 emissions, with employee commuting
representing 32%. In 2023, we noted a 8.4% increase in our total scope 3 emissions compared to
2022. Emissions due to goods transportation increased by 3.6%, partly due to higher production
volumes. However, we achieved a reduction of 10.5% in emissions related to employee commuting,
despite a headcount increase. To support this positive trajectory, our sites reinforced sustainable
employee commuting concepts, promoting green transportation, including car sharing. Flexible
working arrangements, such as working from home, also help to minimize our emissions and we
prioritize remote meetings where possible.
In 2023, our Tours site (France) received Gold Pro-Bike Employer label, a certification in recognition
of its efforts to encourage employees to commute to work responsibly. In addition, our Rennes site
(France) received a ‘Mobil Employeur 2023’ gold level award for successfully promoting alternative
modes of transport to work. Its responsible commuting initiative was launched 10 years ago and
has led to a reduction from 81% to 38% in employees travelling to work individually in cars. This
was achieved by promoting alternative methods such as carpooling, cycling, and public transport,
and increased work from home options.I 305-3 I

The Power Purchase Agreement with ERG marks yet another important step towards ST’s
goal of becoming carbon neutral in its operations (scope 1 and 2 emissions, and
partially scope 3) by 2027, including the sourcing of 100% renewable energy by 2027.
PPAs will play a major role in our transition. Starting in 2024, the PPA will provide a
significant level of renewable energy for ST’s operations in Italy, which include R&D,
design, sales and marketing, and large-volume chip manufacturing.

Offset remaining emissions
Our current environmental programs and data do not include carbon offset projects, which are the
final element of our carbon neutrality program.
We are developing a balanced portfolio of offset projects based on a long-term commitment to local
projects and innovative solutions. In 2023, we investigated potential projects and partners that fit
our offsetting criteria. We focus on the quality of carbon credit certificates generated and have
selected an external advisor to identify the most suitable partners. Our aim is to combine nature-
based solutions with technology solutions, for both carbon removal and avoidance. We will select
and develop these projects in the coming years in collaboration with our stakeholders, according to
local opportunities and needs.
Addressing climate-related risks
Addressing natural hazards risks
Since 2020, when we declared our support for the Task Force on Climate-related Financial
Disclosures (TCFD), we have been working towards implementing TCFD recommendations (see
alsoRisk management and TCFD index).
We adopt a double perspective when considering climate-related risks:
In 2023, we continued to work to address physical risks resulting from climate change that are
either chronic (induced by longer-term shifts in climate patterns) or acute (event-driven) in a way
that is consistent with the TCFD and the EU Green Deal classification, as illustrated in the following

scenarios defined by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC):
For each scenario and for each of the 155 locations, climate projections on 2030 and 2050 time
horizons show likely evolutions across a range of indicators based on the European Taxonomy
classification of climate-related hazards, including:
A study commissioned in 2021, from an environmental consultancy, has been a valuable resource to
help us better understand the characteristics and impact of water scarcity and our carbon footprint
(seeWater).
In addition to these global analyses, site-specific studies on natural hazards are also conducted
where necessary due to local conditions.
Overall, the purpose of these different climate-related analyses is to feed our site-level business
interruption risk assessments and business impact analyses, as well as our site resilience index.
Ultimately, they feed into our regularly updated improvement, adaptation and mitigation plans
addressing environmental and resilience issues in the medium- to long-term.
We are proactively addressing the transition to a lower-carbon economy. In this context, we are in
the process of further identifying and assessing policy, legal, technology, and market transition risks,
across the short-, medium- and long-term, as per the TCFD provisions. Simultaneously, we are
actively investing in developing and launching new products to help our customers implement new
energy-saving applications, transforming risk into opportunity (seeSustainable technology and
Innovation).
Progress towards SBTi validated targets
As part of our carbon neutrality program, ST joined SBTi at the end of 2020. This initiative provides
a clearly defined pathway for companies to reduce their GHG emissions. We were the first
semiconductor company with approved targets to limit warming to no more than 1.5°C.
Our SBTi approved targets related to 1.5°C compliance are intermediate targets within our carbon
neutrality commitment:
By the end of 2023, we were on track towards these targets, achieving 45% and 71%, respectively.

Collaborative approach
We recognize the importance of external partnerships and collaborations to grow and share
knowledge. In 2023, ST joined the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS), which provides a globally
recognized best practice framework to guide water management at sites using water. This
partnership will help us identify common challenges and build knowledge to effectively drive our
water management strategies. Going forward, we plan to work towards AWS certification of our
sites to further demonstrate our commitment to water stewardship.
In October 2023, we attended the Ultrapure Micro Annual Conference in Texas, which focuses on
water treatment in the semiconductor industry. The event provided an opportunity to discover
emerging technologies for water treatment and participate in workshops related to water saving
strategies. Our teams presented new studies and projects, such as the wastewater treatment
project at our Crolles site (France), (see below).
In line with our proactive approach, we participate in several water-related industry working groups
where we share best practices and techniques for water recycling. As part of the European

W WA ATER SA TER SAVIN VING COMMITTEEG COMMITTEE
Reducing water consumption is a priority
across all ST operations. Recent droughts in
France have led us to strengthen our efforts.
In 2023, we set up a Water Saving
committee in France to further oversee
water management. The committee meets
every two weeks and is chaired by
Frédérique Le Grevès, ST's Executive Vice
President Europe & France Public Affairs
and President of STMicroelectronics France. It brings together all French sites and
the cross-functional expertise needed to guide water saving actions in the short and
medium term.
The main objectives of the committee are to drive and coordinate programs and
initiatives for reducing water consumption and recycling. Seasonal risks, such as a
lack of water in the summer, are also taken into consideration. The committee takes a
proactive approach to responding to French government regulations, including the
‘Action plan for concerted and resilient water management’ policy introduced in
March 2023.
With the support of the Water Saving committee, each front-end manufacturing site
is responsible for creating its own roadmap according to the local context. Examples
of actions taken so far include:
Going forward, the committee will continue to support water management and work
with local teams to identify innovative solutions to save water.
Recognized by CDP
We have been participating in CDP’s annual water security survey since 2011.
Preparing our submission helps us identify areas for improvement and

Assessing impact and water-related risks
Water withdrawal
A reliable water supply is essential to the semiconductor manufacturing process. All ST sites
manage their water-related risks according to their needs and water availability. Each site monitors
the volume of water it uses and complies with local permits. Only two of our manufacturing sites
use groundwater for their operations.
In 2023, 87% of the water used throughout our operations came from municipal water supplies,
with 13% coming from groundwater.

Addressing water-related risks
In 2021, we undertook a comprehensive water assessment to evaluate our global water footprint.
Our primary goal was to identify areas of high-water stress and assess the water-related risks of our
operations. Additionally, we aimed to evaluate our impact on local communities and ensure we were
taking steps to mitigate any negative effects.
Our direct and indirect impacts were evaluated using the lifecycle assessment approach. We also
identified that most of our manufacturing sites are at medium risk for operational and external risks,
water quality, and water scarcity, using the Water Risk Filter 5.0 methodology.
In 2022, we went one step further, requesting our manufacturing sites to assess relevant risks and
formalize water saving action plans. As a result, all sites successfully defined remedial actions.
Action plans are reviewed quarterly at both manufacturing and corporate level. The results form part
of each site’s sustainability scorecard that is shared with the Corporate Executive Committee
quarterly.
In the context of the EU taxonomy (see EU taxonomy), in 2023, we conducted a deep review of the
environmental impact assessments of our manufacturing sites to verify compliance with current
legislation and identify potential areas of improvement.
Reducing our water usage
Reducing water consumption while strengthening our recycling are major challenges for our
Company. Manufacturing semiconductors requires a large volume of water, and we are continually
striving to improve water efficiency across our operations.
Saving water
In 2023, our water consumption increased per unit of production
compared to 2022. This was due to an increase in the use of
advanced manufacturing technologies, some of which have a
higher manufacturing footprint, but the devices produced have a
more positive environmental impact in their use phase.
116 ST 2024 Sustainability report

Page 117:


Despite this, in 2023, we reduced our water consumption by 10% per unit of production compared
to 2016. Our 2025 goal is to improve our water efficiency by 20% vs 2016. We recognize that further
efforts will be necessary to meet this target and we are working towards implementing the action
plans identified for each site.
Water usage varies from site to site according to local conditions, such as raw water quality,
treatment technologies, and local strategies. Usage is split across four main areas:
Identifying and measuring water usage is the first step in assessing areas for improvement, such as
technical upgrades or optimizing processes and tools.
Our Ang Mo Kio site (Singapore) introduced several projects to improve its water efficiency. For
example, the site implemented a smart water metering system to identify consumption inefficiencies
and detect leaks and water wastage. This allows for improvements and corrective actions to be
defined, while enhancing the reliability of data monitoring. In line with our aim to operate efficiently
and minimize resource consumption, the site is also implementing a district cooling facility. This will
reduce our emissions and positively affect our water use.
At our Rousset site (France), we held a worldwide water meeting, involving the heads of the water
treatment plants at all front-end sites. Although each site faces different operational, legal, and
technical constraints, the objective was to discuss common challenges, exchange technical know-
how, and share best practices. As a result, our front-end manufacturing sites developed their 2024
water-saving roadmap and initiated a water-saving workgroup.
Our back-end sites also pursued their efforts to improve water efficiency in 2023, with the goal of
reaching an overall water recycling rate of 60% by 2026.
Our Calamba site (the Philippines), implemented a range of maintenance and improvement actions
to help with water conservation. This included drainpipe replacement, drain hose segregation, and
the use of recycled water for the cooling tower instead of fresh water. All the actions implemented
during the year resulted in a water saving of approximatively 20% of the site’s water consumption.
Reuse and recycle
One of our main approaches to water conservation is to reuse and recycle. However, as the
semiconductor production process relies on ultra-pure water, it is not always possible to reuse
processed water. Although water can be treated and recycled into ultra-pure water, it is more often
reused to cover facility needs, such as cooling towers, scrubbers, and thermal processing units.

At our Greater Noida site (India), rainwater harvesting pits are used to collect water from building
roof tops, paved surfaces, roads and green landscaped areas. This increases the amount of water
that enters the ground water reservoir, helping to maintain natural sources.
In 2023, our water recycling rate was 42%, the same level as in
2022. We recognize that further efforts are needed to reach our goal
of 50% by 2025. We have identified the sites where we need to
accelerate actions to achieve our goal.
Treating wastewater
Wastewater from our manufacturing processes contains pollutants, such as heavy metals and toxic
solvents. It is our responsibility to ensure all used water is appropriately treated before discharging it
back into the natural environment.
To mitigate any risk of pollution, our wastewater is treated on site or in municipal treatment plants
before being discharged. Our manufacturing sites are continually improving their treatment of
wastewater and the quality of water discharge, which is carefully controlled and monitored online.
At our Crolles site (France), we started a pilot line to recycle part of the final aqueous discharges
from the wastewater treatment plant. These can then be used in the manufacture of softened water
and ultra-pure water, reducing the use of municipal water for industrial purposes. Recycling
operations started in late 2023 and this process for ultra-pure water is expected to be fully qualified
in the course of 2024. This first-of-a-kind project within the European semiconductor industry will
allow us to recycle up to 40m3 of water per hour in 2024.

Managing our waste
Generating waste is an inevitable part of our operations. Recognizing this, we have developed a
comprehensive waste management strategy to limit our negative impacts. We focus on the
classification, separation, and safe disposal of waste using an approach driven by local regulations
and Company policy. Our priority is to reduce, reuse, and recycle and we consider landfill and
incineration to be a last resort.I 3-3 I
Strengthening our performance
In 2023, 96% of the waste generated by our operations was either
reused, recovered, or sent for recycling, one percentage point
higher than 2022. We also reduced the quantity of waste sent to
landfill from 3.7% in 2022 to 1.9% in 2023. This reduction achieved
our target of an annual landfill rate below 3%.

Zero waste to landfill program
Reducing landfill waste is an ongoing priority. Following the
successful UL Zero Waste to Landfill validation of our Shenzhen site
(China) and Calamba site (the Philippines), ST decided to extend
the program to all manufacturing sites. The UL Zero Waste to
Landfill program is based on the UL2799 standard. It focuses on
monitoring and measuring material flows, detailing waste streams
to optimize processes, and improving waste management with the
aim of reducing waste generation. Recycling and recovery are prioritized to reduce landfill disposal.
In 2023, ST waste management teams received training on the UL2799 standard and our sites
reviewed their waste management targets. These are the first steps towards implementing the UL
Zero Waste to Landfill program across our operations.
Reducing waste generation
We believe the best waste is no waste. We apply this approach at all our manufacturing sites to
minimize unnecessary resource consumption and waste generation. Our sites continually analyze
processes as an important part of continuous improvement and strive to find innovative methods for
waste reduction.
In 2023, several initiatives were implemented to reduce packaging waste. At our Shenzhen site
(China), material packing processes were optimized, reducing carton waste by 30 tons and wooden
waste by 25 tons. The total waste reduction of 55 tons represented approximately 8% of the total
packaging waste generated on site in 2023. These results were achieved through improvements
such as implementing interlaced stacking, reducing inner packaging for carton boxes, and
standardizing and reducing the size of wooden packings to optimize space.
At our Marcianise site (Italy), single use pallets were replaced with a reusable variety known as Euro
pallets. This was achieved by raising awareness of reusable materials across the supply chain and
resulted in the reduction of 33 tons of wood waste.
At our Agrate site (Italy), we reduced the volume of ammonia sulfate waste. This was achieved by
reducing the quantity of water in the waste composition, increasing its concentration from 5% to
25%. As a result, the volume of waste generated and transported was reduced. This had a positive
impact on our transport emissions, which decreased by 50%, while also reducing costs.

At our Catania Site (Italy), chemical products used to treat concentrated acid wastewater in the
wastewater treatment plant were replaced. As a result, sludge production was reduced by 257 tons,
14% less than in 2022.
Contributing to a circular economy
Thoughtful management of waste can conserve resources and contribute towards a circular
economy. For several years, ST has implemented solutions to create value from waste generated by
our activities. This is achieved by converting waste into secondary raw materials that can be used in
other industries.
Our sites actively search for solutions according to the type of waste generated and the local
context.
Palladium is recovered from our manufacturing process and deposited on copper cathodes. This is
achieved through electrolytic electrodeposition, a process that occurs when an electric current is
applied to a solution containing metal ions, causing the movement of the positive ions towards the
cathode. Our Agrate site (Italy), has optimized these processes to enable the recovery of 30kg of
cathodes with palladium since 2017.
Sulfuric acid waste is diverted at our Crolles site (France) through a partnership with a biofuel
producer, reducing the consumption of fossil fuels. Biofuels can be used by trucks, machinery, or
generators.
Plastic packaging trays are sent for recycling into resin pellets by our Ang Mo Kio site (Singapore).
These can be used to make everyday items, such as crates, clothes fibers, food containers, and
bottle caps. The site will divert 5.5 tons of waste from incineration to recycling annually through this
initiative.
At our Calamba site (the Philippines), waste including spent resin and sludge is sent to manufacture
cement bricks, reducing the use of virgin raw materials. The waste material is used to bind the
structure of the cement. Around 29 tons of this waste was diverted in 2023.
Cinzia Quartini

Agrate (Italy)
Our efforts to achieve zero waste and promote a circular economy in Agrate started
many years ago. From the pre-selection phase onwards, we choose suppliers and waste
disposal methods to maximize the recovery and recycling of waste materials. We are
driven by our passion and continually strive for ways to improve waste classification. In
2023, we were able to recycle 98.9% of waste, an achievement I am very proud of.
Fluoride sludge is transformed into pellets for the metallurgy industry.
Sulfuric acids are used for recycling batteries.
Deflashing waste powder is sent for precious metal recovery.
Electronic waste is dismantled; some parts are reused and precious metals are recovered.
Solvents are sent for distillation and reused, or burnt for energy recovery.
Ammonia in wastewater is treated and reused by other companies as a raw material.
Silicon wafer scraps are used for aluminum production for the automotive, aviation, and
photovoltaic industries.

The use of precious metals can pose several
environmental and societal issues. These
include human rights concerns related to
mining, depletion of natural resources, and
associated supply chain uncertainty.
Waste generated at ST’s manufacturing sites
can contain strategic metals, such as
copper, palladium, silver, and gold. To minimize the risk of negative impacts, we
partnered with WEEECycling, an organization dedicated to recovering precious
metals and converting them into high quality recycled materials. Waste from our
Tours site (France), Bouskoura site (Morocco), and Kirkop site (Malta), was treated
using a recovery process consisting of several thermal, chemical, and
electrochemical processes. This produces pure secondary materials with the same
characteristics as primary/virgin materials. The recycled metals have a significantly
lower impact than those from primary extraction and can be reused in the
semiconductor, pharmaceutical, and energy industries. This innovative solution
results in a very high recovery rate (99%) and a low carbon impact.
The partnership between ST and WEEECycling supports the principles of EECONE, a
European project to reduce the impact of the semiconductor industry.
Managing waste beyond our operations
We aim to find innovative solutions for waste management beyond our operations, helping to raise
awareness among our employees.
Proper disposal of waste from electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) is critical for the
environment and human health. At our Calamba site (the Philippines), ‘Don’t bin it! Bring it!’ is a
program which aims to help ST employees properly dispose of their household WEEE. The program
received the good planet prize in ‘Le Trophée Bleu’ sustainability business awards, organized by
CCI France Philippines.
At the end of 2023, our Toa Payoh site (Singapore) installed aerobic biodigester food waste
composters. The new devices can digest up to 50kg of food waste daily. Due to the use of
microbes, nutrient rich fertilizer can be produced for use in-house or in community farms.
Controlling hazardous substances
Our various manufacturing processes can generate hazardous or potentially hazardous waste, such
as chemical substances and contaminated plastics. We focus on all types of hazardous waste (see
Chemicals). We seek to identify the best solution among all available treatment technologies to
minimize any adverse impact from our activities. In 2023, we identified 46% of our waste as
hazardous, 96% of which was reused, recovered, or sent for recycling. The remaining waste was
disposed of and treated locally by specially authorized companies.

We carefully manage the chemical substances and materials we use throughout our operations.
This allows us to monitor and address our impacts on people and the environment and to comply
with legal and customer requirements.
Applying a rigorous approach
Our use and handling of chemicals is led by a precautionary approach, as set out in Principle 15 of
the Rio Declaration and in the ST sustainability charter, available atwww.st.com/
sustainabilitycharter � �. I 2-23 I
At each of our manufacturing sites, a chemical committee meets
regularly to review and evaluate best management practices for
identified hazards. The committee uses a comprehensive approach
to make decisions on chemical usage. This includes evaluating
chemical compositions, hazards, use conditions, engineering
controls, medical recommendations, and industrial hygiene
requirements. Risk management measures, personal protective equipment (PPE), waste
management, administrative controls, and training requirements are also considered. By rigorously
applying this process, we can identify critical substances as soon as they are introduced or
reclassified. Modifications to existing processes are also considered and implemented where
necessary.
In 2023, we recorded approximately 6,500 chemicals in use across all sites, and conducted more
than 700 new risk assessments, achieving nearly 23,000 validated risk assessments by the end of
the year.

Safety of our people
Our goal is to prevent occupational injury and illnesses for all our workers, and to avoid causing
health issues for the surrounding communities. The health of all employees working with chemical
substances is monitored through a medical surveillance program. This includes biomonitoring,
which assesses an individual’s exposure to natural and synthetic chemicals based on analysis of
human tissue and fluid samples.
As an additional precaution, we regularly analyze the air in work areas to verify that our risk
management measures are effective. The results are compared to applicable threshold limit
values (TLV), which are set by regulatory agencies to ensure safe exposure levels for workers. If the
results indicate that the TLV has been exceeded, we take immediate action to identify and address
the source of the problem and implement corrective measures to ensure a safe working
environment.
In 2023, we conducted over 25,000 measurements, all of which were found to be below 50% of the
applicable TLV, which has never been achieved before. This represents a significant improvement,
with more measurements taken than any previous year and more than double the measurements
taken in 2022. Additionally, less than 5% of the measurements exceeded detection limits (DL), the
minimum amount of substance that can be detected, across all tests.
All workers receive specialist training before being assigned

In 2023, our Muar site (Malaysia) introduced
a new production line using panel level
packaging direct copper interconnect (PLP-
DCI) technology. This breakthrough
technology offers significant advantages in
electrical and thermal performance, while
maintaining high standards of performance
and quality.
The design and construction phase involved several organizations, including site
management, R&D, EHS, and industrial engineering. The teams collaborated to
identify and evaluate materials while defining the best technical solutions to
implement. During the project definition, there was a focus on employee safety, fire
prevention, and emergency preparedness. The environmental impact of the
installation was also considered, with evaluation of liquid and air emissions, as well
as waste processing.
As a result, a new double piping system was installed to distribute and dispense all
necessary chemicals, protecting the workers from any potential exposure.
Furthermore, to ensure an adequate level of protection, the chemical storage area,
which contains flammable liquid chemicals, was equipped with additional fire
protection, a suppression system, and local exhaust ventilation.
The new PLP production line in Muar reflects ST’s priority to support the
development of advanced technology while maintaining the highest standards of
safety and sustainability.
Protecting the environment
We recognize the importance of reducing environmental emissions, and we have made it a priority
to do so in the domains of air, water, and waste. Our approach includes treating emissions where
possible (seeWater and Waste) and implementing replacement programs for hazardous
substances throughout our value chain to minimize our environmental impact.
To further reduce our environmental impact, we have implemented an air emission abatement
program that focuses on reducing our emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
Our air emission abatement program includes the use of advanced technologies and processes to
capture and treat air emissions from our manufacturing processes, as well as ongoing online
monitoring to ensure that our installations are working effectively.
By reducing our VOC emissions and reducing the use of solvents and other VOC-emitting materials,
we are able to minimize our impact on the environment and protect the health and safety of our
employees and local communities. Our commitment to reducing environmental emissions in air,
water, and waste is an essential part of our overall mission to operate sustainably and responsibly.
Striving for better
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large class of synthetic chemicals that possess
unique physical and chemical properties. However, they are increasingly recognized as
environmental pollutants and have been linked to negative effects on human health and the
environment, including flora, fauna, and marine living organisms.
FOCUS
126 ST 2024 Sustainability report

Page 127:
100%
DEHP-free
PFAS are used in various stages of the semiconductor manufacturing process, including in
equipment and infrastructure. We recognize that our industry needs to reduce its dependence on
these chemicals. In close coordination with industry players, we are working to identify and
implement non-PFAS technical solutions, looking at the short-, mid- and long-term. This is in line
with our longstanding commitment to minimize our environmental footprint at every stage of our
products’ lifecycle.
In 2023, we contacted all our direct suppliers and manufacturing subcontractors to assess the
presence of PFAS in the products they provide to us or produce for us. We use this evaluation to
identify the remaining PFAS in our products to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, such
as the US EPA.
Using less
Reducing the use of hazardous substances, including substances of very high concern (SVHC), in
our processes and final products helps safeguard the health and safety of our stakeholders, while
reducing our environmental footprint. All our manufacturing sites implement specific actions to
reduce chemical use.
As an example, our Catania site (Italy) decreased chemical consumption in 2023 to below 2018
levels, despite the introduction of new chemical-intensive processes. This was achieved by
reducing the length and complexity of some processes.
Our Shenzhen site (China) initiated a project in 2021 to reduce ethanol consumption, the most used
flammable substance. After surveys to understand and analyze the different usages of ethanol, the
team defined a reduction plan and improved controls. As a result, the site reduced ethanol
consumption by 78% in 2023 compared to 2021 and intends to totally eradicate its use by 2026.
Substituting hazardous substances
We search for the best solutions using technology and innovation to replace hazardous materials in
our manufacturing processes. Following the phasing out of chemicals containing perfluorooctanoic
acid (PFOA)-related substances in 2022, we finalized the eradication of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate
(DEHP) in 2023.
Finalizing the DEHP replacement program
In 2012, DEHP used in plastic tapes was added to REACH(2) Annex XIV, preventing its use in
Europe. We immediately started a program to replace it, collaborating with our suppliers to identify
alternative materials, and with our customers to evaluate and validate potential solutions. As a
result, we ensured all products shipped to Europe were DEHP-free by 2013.
Subsequently, we decided to go beyond the regulations and
replace DEHP across all our products worldwide. Due to the
complexity of our supply chains, this process took time. In 2021,
our sites at Kirkop (Malta) and Shenzhen (China) completed the
substitution of DEHP , and in 2023, our Muar site (Malaysia) finalized
its replacement.
Replacing DEHP in tapes is the result of a considerable collective effort from on-site teams,
suppliers, and customers. It is a milestone that helps us reduce hazardous substances in waste,
thereby increasing our ability to recycle the waste we generate.

Aligning with stakeholders’ expectations
Compliance
We adhere to the highest standards to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations on
chemicals for our manufacturing sites and our products. It is the responsibility of each site to ensure
compliance, based on their specific operations.
When developing new products, their compliance is verified at fixed product development
milestones. At the R&D phase, we only consider and select compliant materials to ensure we act in
accordance with requirements such as RoHS(3) and ELV(4).
Furthermore, we strive to eliminate the use of restricted substances by design. Thanks to new
designs, reduced dimensions, and the lower energy consumption of our chips, we have had
ongoing success in decreasing the use of lead in the assembly process (see ourECOPACK results).
We also continue to identify new materials with reduced antimony and halogen content.
ST products may be subject to declarations, based on the presence of SVHC. In 2023, we
continued to declare new products on the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) portal to ensure
information is available for safe end-of-life disposal.
Across our sites, we continue to work on hazardous substance process management to identify,
control, quantify, and report on any hazardous elements in our components, according to the
IECQ080000 standard.
Customers
Chemical legislation is evolving globally to reduce environmental impacts during manufacturing. It
remains a significant consideration for customers, who closely monitor developments in our
products, processes, and compliance.
Information on materials contained in ST products can be found through the IPC 1752 material
declaration, which is available at www.st.com  . Queries relating to material declaration and
substance use accounted for almost 60% of the environment, health and safety (EHS) enquiries we
received in 2023.
As a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), we are working to align with the RBA
Industry Focus Process Chemical (IFPC) policy. All chemicals listed in the policy have already been
eradicated from our operations. Last year, we completed an IFPC assessment to locate these
chemicals within our supply chain. This year, we are working on measures to replace them,
prioritizing the recommendations of the Clean Electronics Production Network (CEPN).

Loss of biodiversity is a pressing global issue. Natural ecosystems are becoming increasingly
disrupted, which poses a direct threat to humanity. This disruption can be attributed to several
factors, including the impact of industrial activity. It is therefore critical for major organizations like
ST to support the UN Sustainable Development Goals 14 (conserving and sustainably using the
oceans, seas, and marine resources) and 15 (conserving life on land) and embed global biodiversity
objectives into their strategies.
At ST, we maintain a vigilant and proactive approach to protecting the environment and we
recognize the need for concrete actions to help preserve and restore biodiversity.
Understanding biodiversity impacts
During 2022 and 2023, we undertook several initiatives to gain insights into our actual and potential
impacts on biodiversity. These included a biodiversity survey at 22 of our sites to help us
understand our impacts and assess the actions we have already taken. We also commissioned a
specialist study from an external partner on the biodiversity ecosystems close to our sites and
operations to gain a better understanding of the local environment. These investigations informed
the development of our corporate biodiversity strategy.
Our approach is centered on three key pillars that help to define our biodiversity roadmap:

From assessment to action
In 2023, we developed a new method to evaluate the status and progress of biodiversity issues at
our sites based on the results of our assessments.
Each site has a biodiversity scorecard based on 10 criteria. These criteria have been selected to
respond to SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound) objectives and
measure both quantitative and qualitative factors.
This broad range of criteria reflects the diverse locations of our sites and enables them to assess
not only their maturity but also the impact of their initiatives so change can be implemented where
necessary. Each criterion is scored on a scale of 0 to 2, with 2 being the highest score indicating the
best performance. The final visual representation of the scores illustrates the interdependencies
between the criteria. So far, 16 sites, including manufacturing and R&D facilities, have completed
the scorecard. This has enabled them to produce and analyze their results, giving them a final score
in our biodiversity index. This method enables tracking of progress at site level as well as evaluation
of ST as a whole.
In future, sites will be evaluated bi-annually using both estimated and actual data, allowing them to
keep track of their progress and improve their index score. This methodology will help sites identify
areas for improvement and tailor their actions according to their needs and context.I 3-3 I
Adapting to the local environment
As an industry-leading manufacturer with operations across the globe, it is important we adapt to
the local environments in which we operate.
To achieve this, our sites implement a range of local initiatives appropriate to their surroundings and
their biodiversity scorecard. External partnerships with local associations and non-profit
organizations are a critical element of these activities, enabling sites to increase their impact through
collaboration.
In 2023, our Tours site (France) developed a biodiversity strategy in line with the criteria of its
biodiversity scorecard. The strategy was tailored to the local environment and took into account
issues such as climate change expectations, vegetation, and native species, as well as rainwater
management. The site has also formed a partnership with the city of Tours to help restore
biodiversity in the local area.

Our Greater Noida site (India) planted a forest using the ‘Miyawaki method’, following a flora and
fauna assessment and taking into account biodiversity criteria, natural state. The project involved
planting around 1,200 native species of trees.
The Miyawaki method is a tree planting model for creating forests quickly on land that has
previously been used for other purposes, such as agriculture or construction. After two years, the
forest becomes self-sufficient and provides an effective home for birds and insects, while reducing
air pollution.
Our Grenoble site (France) collaborated with a number of local organizations to help improve natural
habitats around the site. This included raising awareness through signage, improving the natural
environment by removing wildlife hazards, installing nest boxes, and limiting light pollution. In 2023,
the site was awarded LPO designation from the Ligue pour La Protection des Oiseaux, a French
NGO dedicated to the protection of birds.

Our Calamba site (the Philippines) is located
close to a biodiversity hotspot and
protected area. In 2023, the site launched a
program called ‘Adopt-a-creek’ to help
restore a 500-meter stretch of Baranca de
Sipit Creek in Calamba city. The initiative
aims to restore balance to the local
ecosystem through a variety of studies and
activities.
The project began with a comprehensive baseline water analysis, which examined
specific parameters including oxygen demand, total suspended solids, and coliform
bacteria levels. The program was then officially launched on Earth Day in April 2023.
It was celebrated with a clean-up activity that involved 101 volunteers, including ST
employees, contractors, local agency officials, and a consultant. The volunteers
removed over 100 bags of rubbish that had been polluting the creek and harming
local ecosystems.

Deputy Mayor in charge of nature and
biodiversity, Tours (France)
In 2023, we joined forces with STMicroelectronics to work towards rewilding a natural
green space in northern Tours, France. Strong commitment and collaboration between
our organizations made it possible to establish a hands-on program to plant species
and restore local biodiversity. Employees had the opportunity to participate in the
program, which helped to raise awareness and understanding of biodiversity matters
related to the site and the local environment.

The program team held quarterly meetings with the Department of Environment and
Natural Resources to discuss compliance, project implementation, and strategy and
achievements. The success of the program inspired another local organization to
adopt a nearby 600-meter stretch of the creek, further expanding restoration efforts
in the area.
The Adopt-a-creek program is ongoing, with ST planning a range of activities to
continue improving the area until 2027. These include tree planting, educational
campaigns, seasonal water analyses, and third-party clean-up activities.
Looking forward
As our corporate biodiversity program develops, we plan to adapt the biodiversity index to meet the
specific requirements of our R&D sites. This will enable us to gain a comprehensive understanding
of our operations. We will also conduct further flora and fauna assessments with specialists to
better understand if there are protected species in the vicinity of our sites. By increasing internal
and external collaboration, we aim to ensure that each site has its own customized plan to help
protect and restore biodiversity.

With over 6,000 direct suppliers worldwide, our supply chain has a significant potential impact on
people and the environment. Our ambition is to source responsibly to create state-of-the-art
technologies that contribute to a more sustainable world.
Our program runs across all our operations and throughout the lifecycle of our supplier
relationships. We monitor our suppliers using social, environmental, and governance criteria,
auditing those that are classified as high-risk. This enables us to mitigate major risks and impacts,
with a focus on carbon neutrality and human rights, including forced labor of vulnerable workers,
unfair working conditions, and health and safety.I 3-3 I
Our supply chain
Our suppliers range from large-scale manufacturing subcontractors,
material suppliers, and equipment and spare-parts suppliers, to
smaller scale onsite service providers and labor agencies. Our
procurement spend is split mainly between Europe (46%) and Asia
(35%), and we manage 40% of our procurement volume locally, at a

Integrated responsible supply chain management
We continually reinforce our management systems to make them more proactive, strategy-
embedded, risk-oriented, and impact-driven. Decisions and actions are steered through robust
sustainability governance. Our Sustainability Committee conducts dedicated, expert-led sessions
on responsible supply chain at least annually to advise the Supervisory Board (seeGovernance).
In 2023:
We launched several new working groups involving key internal stakeholders, including
Procurement, Sustainability, Risk, and Finance, to address recently adopted and upcoming
regulations in Europe regarding social and environmental due diligence in the supply chain.
We continued to integrate sustainability in procurement by adopting a new vision: ‘Strategically-
led best-in-class procurement enabling ST’s competitive advantage for sustainable growth and
profitability’; and mission: ‘Drive strategic, operational, and transactional excellence by selecting,
developing, and leveraging suppliers that are highly-integrated into our company strategy, in a
sustainable manner’.
We reinforced sustainability roles in procurement management. We hired additional staff to
monitor suppliers and provided training in human rights and environmental topics. We also
launched an ambitious training program for our buyers as a first step in raising their awareness of
environmental challenges.
We reinforced our supply chain environmental strategy around renewable energy procurement
(seeEnergy and climate change), water (see Water), and climate change (scope 3). Within this
framework, we launched a comprehensive carbon footprint assessment of our most emissive
suppliers through our ‘Carbon neutrality in the supply chain’ program (see focus).
We created a supply chain mapping committee to reinforce our responsible sourcing program,
extending the scope beyond conflict minerals to other critical materials, and adopted a forced
labor statement detailing our actions in our upstream supply chain.

CHAIN PRCHAIN PROJECT OJECT
ST is committed to decarbonization and
aims to work with its partners to reduce
carbon emissions. In 2023, we launched a
carbon neutral supply chain program to
reduce our scope 3 emissions related to the
purchase of goods and services. The
objectives are to:
In 2023, one of the program’s main achievements was collecting the carbon footprint
of 95 suppliers, representing more than 60% of our purchasing spend, including
those suppliers and subcontractors with the highest emissions. The figures showed
that our top 50 suppliers represent 60% of our scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions
related to the purchase of goods and services.
An additional achievement was identifying emission reduction levers for pilot
commodities and developing guidance to engage suppliers.
We also built a roadmap for a three-stage training course for buyers, launching the
first stage to raise awareness of environmental challenges.
Our next steps will be to upskill our buyer community with advanced training, set
reduction objectives with suppliers, and monitor their performance.
Risk management
Our approach to managing our supply chain starts with identifying risks. This enables us to take
targeted actions to control these risks and remediate any negative impacts.
Sustainability risks
To identify, prevent and mitigate sustainability risks, we conduct regular risk assessments of our
supply chain.
We assess risks before onboarding suppliers. In 2023, 100% of our
new material suppliers were assessed for sustainability risks,
including risks related to forced labor, occupational health and
safety, and the environment, including management of hazardous
substances. When critical risks such as forced labor are identified,
we take further action, ranging from individual support to full onsite
audits. Failure to mitigate risks may result in banning suppliers.
Each year we conduct a risk assessment of all our tier one suppliers based on supplier activity risks
and supplier location risks. Risk identification is based on external data obtained through an
intelligence platform and industry audit results, as well as internal audit data. We refine the process
according to purchasing spend and the presence of suppliers on site. In 2023, we identified
373 suppliers across 541 facilities as being at risk in terms of sustainability.
In 2023 we launched a company-wide program dedicated to carbon footprint assessment. The
assessment covers 95 suppliers representing more than 60% of our annual spend in 2022.

Addressing and monitoring our risks
Engage, prevent, mitigate, and remediate
As a full member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), we are committed to complying with
the RBA code of conduct, which we have adopted as our supplier standard. The RBA supplier
engagement model (see below) is an important pillar of our supply chain due diligence.
When entering into a business relationship with ST, suppliers must declare they have read and
understood ST’s business ethics and corporate responsibility statement, and that they agree to
comply with the latest version of the RBA code of conduct and apply it in their own supply chain.
In addition, we require our high-risk suppliers to undertake the three steps of the RBA engagement
model:

We regularly follow-up with our suppliers to encourage them to sign the RBA commitment letter. Our
aim is to secure 100% compliance. All audited suppliers with non-conformances must implement
corrective actions. These are verified in a follow-up closure audit. Our closure rate is reported inKey
data.
Sustainability performance is fully integrated into our supplier performance management model. If
the supplier is unable or unwilling to meet these requirements, we may impose sanctions. These
could include decreasing the supplier’s market share or terminating the contract.
Our actions also cover remediation if harm is detected. The amount of recruitment fees reimbursed
to workers as remediation measures decreased significantly in 2023 to US$6,000, compared to
US$248,000 in 2022. This was due to delays in some supplier reimbursements. Some
reimbursements also included fees related to medical expenses, which are usually much lower than
other recruitment fees, leading to a lower average reimbursement amount per worker.
Capacity building on sustainability
Engaging buyers
In 2023, more than 150 buyers were engaged in our carbon neutrality training program. The first of
the three stages aims to raise buyers’ awareness of environmental challenges and create a common
culture of environmental engagement. Subsequent stages aim to develop advanced and expert
competencies to targeted managers and buyers.
Training procurement managers
We regularly train procurement managers engaged in responsible supply chain programs to develop
their expertise in social and environmental domains.
In addition, we invite our procurement community to participate in responsible supply chain
quarterly calls, where we present the most recent updates on regulations, risk identification, and
monitoring processes.
Developing suppliers
We support our suppliers in raising their awareness of sustainable practices. We provide e-learning
on risk areas such as labor (including working hours and forced labor), ethics, health and safety, and
the environment, and through dedicated awareness sessions where necessary.
In 2023, more than 170 companies participated in our customized learning paths in the RBA e-
learning platform or were trained by our site Sustainability Champions. In addition, our site
Sustainability Champions, together with ST’s suppliers, organized awareness and training sessions
for workers. Overall, more than 1,600 supplier employees took part in e-learning sessions,
meetings, webinars, and workers’ voice channels in 2023.
We also engage locally with suppliers by organizing local stakeholder events at ST sites. These
included a safety week at ST Crolles (France), supplier days at ST Bouskoura (Morocco), ST Catania
(Italy), and ST Kirkop (Malta), and sustainability commitment trophies at ST Rousset (France), where
we created a sustainability award for local suppliers. The 2023 award went to Sodexo for its ‘Waste
Watch’ program to reduce catering waste.

Grievance reporting
Like our own employees, our suppliers and their workers have the right to use our independent
multilingual ethics hotline to share any concerns. The hotline is accessible online (see
www.st.com� �) or by phone in several languages and allows reports to be made anonymously if
desired. If grievances are raised, ST and the supplier must ensure complainants are protected
against any retaliation.I 3-3 I

The standards of the RBA are often more stringent than domestic laws. It is challenging
to understand complex requirements and align company rules, including those for
suppliers. Amid these challenges, we greatly appreciate ST’s support, providing advice

A diverse range of minerals and metals are needed to manufacture semiconductors. Sourcing these
components is complex and requires robust processes to manage the risks. The multitier nature of
the supply chain adds further difficulties, as does its global scale, which may include areas affected
by conflict.
At ST, we have developed a holistic approach to identify, manage, and monitor responsible mineral
sourcing. We are closely engaged with our suppliers and conduct due diligence in our sub-tier
supply chain. We acknowledge the critical role of minerals in the green transition. It is therefore our
priority to ensure we do not procure raw materials that have a negative impact on people, and we
actively seek solutions to limit our impact on the environment. Further details of our approach to this
topic can be found on our dedicated webpage atwww.st.com � �.
Our policy statement is fully aligned with OECD due diligence guidelines. It is available at

Conflict-free minerals
Acting on 3TGs
Tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold, collectively known as the 3TGs, are used in electronic
components such as semiconductors. They are also potential ‘conflict minerals’. This refers to
minerals (and the associated refined metals) that are mined, traded, controlled, supported, or
financed by illegal armed groups, causing serious human rights violations and environmental
damage in conflict-affected and high-risk areas (CAHRAs).
We use a holistic
approach to identify,
manage, and
monitor responsible

As part of our strategy to address this risk, we joined the
Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) in 2011 and started to
implement a conflict minerals process focused on the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and neighboring countries.
In 2012, we released our first Conflict Minerals Reporting
Template (CMRT). By implementing new processes and reporting
templates within our supply chain, we achieved 100%
compliance with the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process
(RMAP). From 2017 to 2020 and again in 2022 and 2023, all our
products were conflict-mineral free.

Extending to cobalt
In 2016, we extended our efforts to monitor cobalt, another potential conflict mineral found in our
products and technologies. Two years later, cobalt became part of our standard process, and we
published our first Cobalt Reporting Template (CRT), issued by the RMI. At the end of 2021, we
started using the Extended Minerals Reporting Template (EMRT), which is a combination of the CRT
and Mica Reporting Template (MRT).
Our 2023 EMRT demonstrates significant progress, 82% of the smelters in our supply chain are now
RMAP compliant, compared to 60% in 2022.
As a member of the RMI, we benefit from access to valuable resources and data to monitor our
impacts and progress, and ensure we comply with new or evolving regulations. We contribute to
RMI working groups and plan to address further unregulated minerals in the future.

Risk assessment and mitigation
We require our suppliers to use minerals originating from smelters that conform to the RMAP
standard. Each new supplier is screened, and every new raw material is systematically pre-
assessed to determine whether it falls within the scope of our responsible minerals sourcing
program.
We are committed to removing all non-compliant smelters from our supply chain. Every year,
suppliers complete a questionnaire on our requirements, enabling us to evaluate their maturity and
their willingness to commit to due diligence. Additionally, suppliers are required to provide us with
their updated CMRT. In case of changes in the supply chain, suppliers are expected to notify us
within two weeks and provide a compliant reporting template within 90 days.
We ensure we remain vigilant by sharing any risks we identify with ST management every quarter.
We encourage any stakeholders concerned about non-compliance or risk of non-compliance to
raise a grievance either on our independent multilingual ethics hotline, accessible on our website
(seewww.st.com  ), or through the RMI grievance portal  .
2023 overview
As part of our ongoing due diligence efforts, in 2023 we declared 210 smelters from 141 suppliers
and subcontractors in our 3TGs supply chain. At the end of the year, 100% of these smelters were
validated as RMAP compliant, the same as 2022. During the year, we removed 26 smelters from our
supply chain and introduced seven new smelters.
External environment
In 2023, the global geopolitical environment remained challenging. Despite this, we managed to
complete our annual supplier questionnaire in four months, compared to five months the previous
year. This was achieved through better collaboration with suppliers, a proactive approach to
previously identified issues, and a drive for greater transparency from all involved parties.
We continue to face challenges related to supplier CMRT publication. These setbacks are difficult to
anticipate and cause delays in our own reporting process. We continue to take into consideration
external conflicts and new laws to ensure we remain compliant with all relevant regulations.
Internal processes
The CMRT is an essential tool for us to share our supply chain evolution with our customers. In
2023, we released five CMRT updates.
In recent years we have had a steady increase in customer requests
on responsible mineral sourcing, reaching more than 600. In view of
this heightened demand, we implemented a new communication
process to make relevant information and updates more accessible.
Updates to the CMRT are now automatically communicated to
customers who have already raised a request. A total of
165 customers benefited from this new process in 2023.
In 2023, a supply chain mapping committee was established within ST as part of our responsible
sourcing program. The committee considers conflict minerals among other materials (see
Responsible supply chain). We also worked towards further digitalization of our processes. This
included a review of our global process data management, which will allow for greater accuracy in
the future and reduce CMRT cycle time going forward.
We have worked to increase internal knowledge and awareness of responsible minerals through
cross-functional collaboration, training, and communication. In 2023, we hosted our first ever
supplier and material quality day. This was a collaborative event which brought together experts
from diverse departments within ST to raise awareness of minerals and metals.

EU regulation
In 2021, the EU Conflict Minerals Regulation (EU Regulation 2017/821) came into force. We decided
to voluntarily engage in the RMI Downstream Assessment Program (DAP). This provides validation
for customer requirements across mineral and metal value chains and meets the requirements of the
EU regulation. In 2022, ST was confirmed as fully compliant – the first semiconductor company to
pass this audit.
As an early adopter of the program, we were among the first companies to be reassessed and pass
the audit in 2023. This process gave us the opportunity to monitor the evolution of our responsible
minerals sourcing program and reevaluate internal procedures and practices. This included:
We also published a combined conflict mineral report in accordance with the US Security and
Exchange Commission (SEC) and EU reporting framework, available at www.st.com  .

activities and makes it easier for employees to contribute to
community initiatives. The program was launched with dedicated
events and initiatives at four ST sites: Catania (Italy), Crolles
(France), Geneva (Switzerland), and Muar (Malaysia). This led to
an increase in employee awareness about their potential
contributions to local communities and beyond. At our Muar site,
nearly 500 people donated blood, while at our Catania site, a
festive lunch was organized at the end of the year for
100 elderly people. As a result of donations, the sites were able to collect and distribute nearly
2,000 books to children in their respective communities. In 2024, the tool will be rolled out to all ST
sites and employees.
STEM your way program
Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education prepares students with the
knowledge and skills to succeed in a technology-driven world. It can provide the tools needed to
develop solutions to complex global problems and boost curiosity in young people. Our ‘STEM your
way’ program raises awareness among young people about the importance of STEM subjects and
inspires them to explore STEM-related careers.
In 2023, we organized over 610 STEM events and initiatives, a 35%
increase on the previous year. As a result of this effort, there were
more than 100,000 beneficiaries including students and teachers.
Our worldwide network of STEM champions and ambassadors has
helped us accelerate our efforts and effectively develop and launch
engaging initiatives.

We recognize the benefits of encouraging curiosity and creativity in children before they choose
their academic path. Throughout the year, we significantly increased the number of events to reach
more children, including webinars, tours of our sites, and visits to schools, with dedicated hands-on
activities.
Building partnerships is an important step in this commitment. Our Beijing site (China), signed a
three-year memorandum of understanding with the local government in Pengshui to cooperate on
sustainable development. The partnership provides assistance and support to address digital and
educational gaps in the region. In 2023, student scholarships were provided, and equipment such
as computers was donated to local schools.
Under the framework of our STEM your way program, ST supports ‘Adopt a float’, a
multidisciplinary educational initiative to promote ocean literacy (see ST blog  ). The program
helps people understand the impact of climate disruption on aquatic life, with teaching materials
designed to make the topic especially accessible to primary, middle, and high school children. Our
STEM ambassadors plan to use this partnership to inform students about the use of robots to
promote ocean sustainability.
Higher education
At university level, we help to equip students with skills for their future careers. Our technical
experts are involved in developing new curricula, building content, delivering courses, and training
teachers to prepare students for the world of work. In 2023, we expanded our reach to new
countries, including Egypt and Mexico, where we were able to identify and support various
initiatives.
In 2023, our Rousset site (France) continued to develop our I-NOVMICRO innovation program to
develop and promote microelectronics in the south of France. Several successful initiatives were
launched in schools, universities, and laboratories. These included I-NOVGAMES, which gave local
engineering students the opportunity to innovate for the Olympics by developing connected objects
using ST components. Several of these projects were presented at ‘Fabriquons France 2030’, an
event in Paris which was attended by the Minister of National Education and the Minister of Higher
Education and Research.

STEM for girls
We believe our industry needs more diverse talent to create a better future. Combating gender
stereotypes in science and technology is a key focus of our initiatives. We expanded our programs
in this area, with 50 initiatives in 2023 reaching 7,390 students.
In 2023, we held our second edition of ‘Break the Bias’, with global events reaching around
1,800 teenagers. In Singapore, we continued to develop our approach, with a focus on attracting
diverse talent to STEM subjects (see focus). Our Muar site (Malaysia) launched a STEM lab at a
local primary school. The lab aims to encourage primary and secondary school girls to explore
STEM by providing them with an inspiring learning environment and appropriate equipment and
resources.
STEM IN SINSTEM IN SINGAPORE GAPORE
Inspiring and engaging young people in
STEM is an important way to attract a new
generation of engineers. At our Ang Mo Kio
site (Singapore), the STEM program has
expanded significantly, growing from six
activities in 2021 to 33 in 2023. A strategic
partnership with ‘GirlsPioneers’, a flagship
program by United Women Singapore, has
led to improved gender diversity, with many
girls participating in the events and activities.
The growth and success of the program can be attributed to our STEM
ambassadors, who increased from 25 to nearly 100 by the end of 2023, thanks to the
work of a dedicated core team. ST’s STEM ambassadors are volunteers who share
their skills and expertise as speakers, mentors, and robotics coaches. The team is
driven by passion and an ambition to raise engagement with STEM in the local
community.
To develop the program, Vittascience kits were used as a key tool throughout 2023.
The kits made it easier to engage primary and secondary school students and those
in tertiary institutions, regardless of gender. Exciting robotics workshop were a great
way to explain the semiconductor industry and introduce ST to a new audience.
Thanks to the commitment of those involved, the program now reaches around
2,000 people each year.
In Italy, our female-focused STEM events reached approximately 1,800 participants. An example
from our Catania site (Italy) is Women in Science (WiS), an initiative launched by the Institute for
Microelectronics (CNR-IMM). It aims to share scientific culture and STEM related activities with girls
and boys from 15 to 18 years old. Seminars are held throughout the year, hosted by female
researchers from the institute, speakers from national and international universities, and female
technical experts from ST. There is a strong emphasis on breaking down gender stereotypes and
biases to encourage girls to embrace careers in STEM.

ST Foundation: two decades of impact
The mission of the ST Foundation (see www.stfoundation.org  ) is to develop, coordinate, and
sponsor projects that use modern science to promote progress and sustainable development in less
privileged communities worldwide. In 2023, the foundation’s flagship Digital Unify (DU) program
reached a significant milestone, having impacted over one million individuals since its inception
20 years ago.
The work of the foundation has always been centered on education
to empower people individually and as a community. In the last two
decades, educational activities like the DU program have expanded
from reaching 900 individuals to over 100,000 annually, a testament
to the commitment and success of its campaigns. In 2023, a new
strategic partnership with the International Telecommunication
Union (ITU) was established.
To achieve its aims, the ST Foundation receives a wide range of support from ST. In 2023, this
included:
In 2023, the foundation added additional resources in its efforts to strengthen digital literacy. These
included new tools and courses such as Vittascience starter kits  , coding courses made by a
French startup specializing in educational tools. A key development was the global roll out of the
coding course in countries including Italy, France, Morocco, India, Malaysia, the Philippines, and
Senegal. ST employees were essential to the initiative’s growth and success, in particular a ‘Train
the trainer’ initiative led by volunteers from our Tunis site (Tunisia).
The support of ST employees also made it possible to launch a new initiative in Senegal. Launched
in November 2023, the project is sponsored by ITU and aims to teach 80 young girls to code in its
first phase.

(CNR-IMM) and ST Catania (Italy) since 2019. The Women in Science project hosts
seminars which present academic research from our institute, alongside industry
expertise and knowledge from ST. Through this relationship, we are able to break down
silos, find a common vision, and provide young women with a unique perspective of
the possibilities offered by the scientific world.

EU Taxonomy
The EU Taxonomy Regulation
On July 12, 2020, EU Regulation 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June
18, 2020 (the “EU Taxonomy Regulation”) entered into force. The EU Taxonomy Regulation
establishes the basis for a classification system to determine which economic activities can be
considered environmentally sustainable. The EU Taxonomy Regulation is part of the EU’s overall
efforts to reach the objectives of the European Green Deal, Europe’s strategy towards climate
neutrality in 2050. The EU Taxonomy Regulation is designed as a transparency tool to help
companies and investors make sustainable investment decisions, with the overall purpose to steer
financing towards more sustainable economic activities. Pursuant to the EU Taxonomy Regulation,
we are required to disclose information on how and to what extent our activities qualify as
environmentally sustainable. The EU Taxonomy Regulation is implemented in phases and will further
develop over the coming years. Consequently, disclosure obligations under the EU Taxonomy
Regulation will enter into force in multiple phases. The EU Taxonomy Regulation effective as per
reporting year 2021 is recent legislation and includes additional reporting obligations for financial
year 2023 as a result of changes to the EU Taxonomy Delegated Acts (as defined below) and
presentation formats.
Environmental objectives
The EU Taxonomy Regulation defines overarching conditions which an economic activity must meet
to be considered environmentally sustainable and focuses on six environmental objectives, being (i)
climate change mitigation, (ii) climate change adaptation, (iii) the sustainable use and protection of
water and marine resources, (iv) the transition to a circular economy, (v) pollution prevention and
control and (vi) the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. For these
environmental objectives, several delegated acts have been issued containing technical screening
criteria (“Taxonomy technical screening criteria”), which specify environmental performance
requirements for the economic activities to be classified as environmentally sustainable (“EU
Taxonomy Delegated Acts”).
On January 1, 2022, the EU Taxonomy Delegated Act on climate change mitigation and climate
change adaptation entered into force. The EU Taxonomy Delegated Acts on the other four
environmental objectives entered into force on January 1 2024, as well as the amended EU
Taxonomy Delegated Acts on climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation (the
“Climate Delegated Act”).
Eligibility and alignment
For financial year 2023, as a non-financial undertaking, we have to disclose information on our
economic activities which are eligible (“Taxonomy-eligible”), non-eligible (“Taxonomy non-eligible”)
and aligned (“Taxonomy-aligned”) under the EU Taxonomy Regulation.
An economic activity can be considered Taxonomy-eligible when the economic activity is described
as such in the relevant EU Taxonomy Delegated Act. To assess whether the relevant economic
activity can also be considered Taxonomy-aligned, an additional evaluation must be made to
identify if the overarching Taxonomy technical screening criteria are met. Economic activities that
are not described in the EU Taxonomy Delegated Acts are considered Taxonomy non-eligible.
Applicability of the EU Taxonomy Regulation to ST
As a listed company the EU Taxonomy Regulation is applicable to us, and subsequently, we must
disclose information on how and to what extent our economic activities are associated with
economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable under the EU Taxonomy Regulation.
We have taken note of the developments of the EU Taxonomy Delegated Acts relating to the six
environmental objectives. We notably screened all the economic activities listed in the EU Taxonomy
159 ST 2024 Sustainability report

Page 160:
Delegated Acts for each environmental objective. Our activities are not described in the EU
Taxonomy Delegated Act on the other four environmental objectives and are not included in the
additional activities added to the Climate Delegated Act. This assessment did not result in additional
disclosures on economic activities included herein compared to our reporting over financial year
2022.
For financial year 2023 in relation to climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation, we
hereinafter include disclosure of: (i) Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-aligned economic activities, (ii)
Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-non-aligned economic activities, and (iii) Taxonomy non-eligible
economic activities within our turnover, capital expenditure and operating expenditure. In addition
for financial year 2023, in relation to the four other environmental objectives, we hereinafter include
disclosure of Taxonomy non-eligible economic activities within our turnover, capital expenditure and
operating expenditure.
The following disclosures pursuant to the EU Taxonomy Regulation are based on the most recent
interpretations of the EU Taxonomy Regulation as published by the European Commission.
Acknowledging that the EU Taxonomy Regulation is still under development and its interpretation
and application is evolving, our disclosure approach under the EU Taxonomy Regulation might
consequently evolve accordingly.
Environmentally sustainable activities
Under the EU Taxonomy Regulation an economic activity is considered environmentally sustainable
(“EU Taxonomy-aligned”) if it meets the following conditions:
1. provides a substantial contribution to one of the six above-mentioned environmental objectives
by complying with Taxonomy technical screening criteria;
2. does not significantly harm any of the other environmental objectives (i.e. does not support one
environmental objective at the expense of progress on another environmental objective)
(“DNSH”); and
3. complies with internationally recognized minimum safeguards (e.g. OECD Guidelines for
Multinational Enterprises, UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights) (“MSS”).
We assessed our economic activities against the EU Taxonomy Regulation classification system in
various steps, amongst others: (i) identifying the economic activities relevant for the EU Taxonomy
Regulation disclosure, (ii) performing a Taxonomy-eligibility assessment based on the relevant EU
Taxonomy Delegated Act, and (iii) assessing Taxonomy-alignment of the economic activities. For the
disclosure of Taxonomy-eligibility and Taxonomy-alignment we assessed the proportion of our turnover,
capital expenditure and operating expenditure, related to environmentally sustainable activities.
Enabling economic activity
We believe that the semiconductor industry plays a key role as a strategic enabler of a low carbon
society as well as to manage the transition towards carbon neutrality. As part of our value
proposition, we aim at designing and manufacturing products that are power efficient and support
our customers in developing technologies that have low carbon footprint. Low carbon applications
such as electric mobility, renewable energies, smart cities, or smart building have been and remain
strategic markets for us. We are a market leader in the design and manufacturing of power solutions
and motor control enabling products, in which there are ample opportunities for short-term impact
on greenhouse gas emissions. We are also a market leader in terms of ultra-low power ICs such as
sensors or microcontrollers.
While some sectors contribute directly to climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation,
we, as an intermediate product manufacturer, enable “the manufacturing of low-carbon
technologies”, which activity is also covered by the EU Taxonomy Regulation classification system.
Our activities which aim at contributing to climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation,
are the manufacturing of electronic components that enable other sustainable economic activities
and applications. The relevant EU Taxonomy Delegated Act lists economic activities that may be
considered Taxonomy-eligible based on associated so-called NACE codes. For our Taxonomy-
eligibility we report on NACE code 26: “Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products”;
and NACE code 26.11: “Manufacture of electronic components”. NACE code 26.11 is considered
relevant for the semiconductor market as confirmed in the guidance published on the interpretation
of the EU Taxonomy Regulation by the European Commission in October 2022. For financial year
160 ST 2024 Sustainability report

Page 161:
2023, we therefore continue reporting under section 3.6 of the EU Taxonomy Delegated Act on
Manufacture of low carbon technologies.
Our EU Taxonomy-eligibility assessment
In our Taxonomy-eligibility assessment we identified all our products, which aim at contributing
substantially to climate change mitigation. These products are divided into the following four
product categories: (i) products that have a low carbon manufacturing footprint compared to similar
products of a previous generation, (ii) products that have low power consumption or low power loss
characteristics compared to similar products manufactured by us or others, (iii) products that bring
an advantage to run a low greenhouse gas emission end application or (iv) products that bring an
advantage to improve efficiency of high greenhouse gas emitting end applications.
With regard to climate change adaptation, we constantly assess how our products could contribute
to climate change adaption and potentially qualify under the relevant EU Taxonomy criteria. Capital
expenditure related to the implementation of climate change adaptation solutions is less than 1% of
our total capital expenditure as reported in Notes 7.6.10, 7.6.11 and 7.6.12 of our consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 (see Annual and semi-annual reports –
STMicroelectronics NV onwww.st.com  ).
EU Taxonomy reporting – Taxonomy-eligible
economic activities related to climate change
mitigation
Our approach towards application of the EU Taxonomy Regulation for the relevant KPIs: turnover, capital
expenditure and operating expenditure for EU Taxonomy reporting purposes is reflected below.
Turnover of Taxonomy-eligible economic activities
In our Taxonomy-eligibility assessment all our product lines have been reviewed. Products falling
into one of the four product categories referenced above are considered Taxonomy-eligible and we
have included the relevant turnover generated from those products in the Taxonomy turnover
calculation.
This assessment resulted in a turnover of Taxonomy-eligible economic activities amounting to 40% of
our total revenues reported for the financial year 2023, whereby the denominator is based on our total
revenues as reported on the consolidated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2023,
while the numerator is based on the total net turnover of our products considered as Taxonomy-eligible.
This is to compare to 38% for the financial year 2022, following product portfolio evolution.
Capital expenditure of Taxonomy-eligible economic activities
To determine the Taxonomy-eligible portion of our capital expenditure the following has been taken
into account:
For determining the Taxonomy-eligible portion of the capital expenditure, the denominator is
determined based on the 2023 additions to property, plants and equipment (including rights of use
for leased assets), intangible assets (including capitalized development costs), as reported in Notes
7.6.10, 7.6.11 and 7.6.12 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2023 (see Annual and semi-annual reports – STMicroelectronics NV onwww.st.com  ).
investments in our technologies, which have been directly associated with Taxonomy-eligible
product lines based on our capital expenditure plan for each technology;
individual measures, such as investments for our carbon neutrality program or investments
related to energy efficiency of our processes;
investments related to IP or licenses or capitalized development costs, which have been
classified as Taxonomy-eligible based on the relevant product line; and
lease of buildings and equipment which have been considered as fully or partially Taxonomy-
eligible.
161 ST 2024 Sustainability report

Page 162:
Furthermore, the numerator equals the part of the capital expenditure (including IFRS 16 leases)
related to assets or processes that (i) are associated with Taxonomy-eligible economic activities, (ii)
are part of a capital expenditure plan to expand Taxonomy-eligible economic activity, and (iii) are
individual measures enabling economic activities to become low-carbon or to lead to greenhouse
gas reduction.
This results in a capital expenditure of Taxonomy-eligible economic activities amounting to 48% of
our total capital expenditure for the financial year 2023, higher than the ratio published for the
financial year 2022 (46%). This growth is primarily driven by a more granular and wider coverage of
our investments review.
Operating expenditure of Taxonomy-eligible economic activities
For determining the operating expenditure of Taxonomy-eligible economic activities, the
denominator is determined based on R&D expenses, as reported in our consolidated income
statement for the year ended December 31, 2023, after deducting depreciation and amortization,
certain expenses and overheads, which are not directly associated with the development of new
products or technologies.
Furthermore, the numerator equals to the part of the operating expenditure included in the
denominator that is any of the following: (a) related to assets or processes associated with
Taxonomy-eligible economic activities, (b) part of the capital expenditure plan to expand Taxonomy-
eligible economic activities. For the numerator, we reviewed each R&D project with the following
approach:
This assessment results in operating expenditure of Taxonomy-eligible economic activities amounting to
47% of our total operating expenditure for the financial year 2023, compared to 35% in 2022. This
growth is primarily driven by a more granular and wider coverage of our R&D projects review.
EU Taxonomy Regulation reporting – Taxonomy-
aligned activities related to climate change
mitigation
As mentioned above, Taxonomy-alignment implies that the economic activities comply with the
following three conditions:
1. providing a substantial contribution to one of the six environmental objectives by complying
with the Taxonomy technical screening criteria;
2. complying with the DNSH criteria; and
3. complying with the minimum safeguards criteria.
Substantial contribution
Turnover of environmentally sustainable (Taxonomy-aligned) economic activities
To verify to what extent the turnover is aligned according to the Taxonomy technical screening
criteria of the “Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation” from EU Taxonomy Regulation,
we apply the principles of the described activity as reflected under 3.6 “Manufacture of other low
carbon technologies”: “the economic activity manufactures technologies that are aimed at and
demonstrate substantial life-cycle greenhouse gas emission savings compared to the best
performing alternative technology/product/solution available on the market”.
In the case of semiconductors, the greenhouse gas reduction can come from both products (supply,
manufacturing, end-of life) as from contributions to application impact (usage). Therefore, we have
adopted a combined approach to reflect this duality. Firstly, for all our product lines classified as
each R&D project linked to a product line classified as Taxonomy-eligible resulted in Taxonomy-
eligible operating expenditure; and
for the remaining R&D projects serving multiple product lines or technologies, we applied
relevant allocation keys taking into account, amongst others, the above mentioned Taxonomy-
eligible portion of our turnover.
162 ST 2024 Sustainability report

Page 163:
Taxonomy-eligible on the basis of their low power consumption characteristics or the low
manufacturing footprint criteria, life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions have been calculated and
compared to a previous generation of products made by us. As a result, the sales of certain
products have been excluded from our turnover calculation. For the product lines classified as
Taxonomy-eligible on the basis of their contribution in a low or high greenhouse gas emitting end
applications, a second assessment has been performed at application level, aiming at qualifying our
substantial contribution. We have considered an internal application classification to reflect the
overall impact of the semi-conductor on the electricity consumption of the application, hence its
implied greenhouse gas emissions. We selected the turnover of our product lines ending in
applications considered, as either low greenhouse gas emitting applications (e.g. electric vehicle) or
high greenhouse gas emitting but transitional applications (e.g. data center servers), on the basis of
the high impact of the semiconductor in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions during the
operating lifetime of the applications.
Capital expenditure of environmentally sustainable (Taxonomy-aligned) economic activities
A similar approach as for Taxonomy-eligibility has been adopted to determine the Taxonomy-
alignment of our capital expenditure and consistent with the approach defined for the Taxonomy-
alignment of the turnover. Notably for the main category related to the investment in our
technologies, where the investment supporting product lines aligned as per the turnover approach
were included i.e. the ones bringing a key advantage to low or transitional greenhouse gas emitting
end applications.
An allocation key derived from the proportion of our aligned investment was applied to building and
equipment, and other capital expenditure not directly linked to a product line.
Operating expenditure of environmentally sustainable (Taxonomy-aligned) economic activities
A similar approach as for Taxonomy-eligibility has been adopted to determine the Taxonomy-
alignment of operating expenditure, and consistent with the approach defined for the Taxonomy-
alignment of the capital expenditure. Substantial contribution was determined by either associating
the R&D project with a product line, or by applying a relevant ratio of aligned turnover.
Do No Significant Harm (DNSH)
The second pillar of our approach to Taxonomy-alignment relates to the demonstration that our
economic activity does no significant harm to the other five environmental objectives included in the
EU Taxonomy Regulation:
For each environmental objective, we have designed templates to approach the various sub-criteria
in a consistent manner across our activities. Only the pollution prevention and control regarding use
and presence of chemicals’ objective resulted in the identification of product lines which were not
compliant and had a direct negative impact on the Taxonomy-aligned turnover, capital expenditure
and operating expenditure KPIs.
Climate change adaptation
As mentioned in Energy and climate change part, we performed a climate risk and vulnerability
assessment together with an external provider to ensure that climate projections are based on
state-of-the-art science compared to two scenarios set out by the United Nations Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change, as required under this DNSH criterion. This assessment covers all
relevant ST and partner sites and features a risk analysis (projected evolution of physical risks
(natural hazards)) as well as an overall vulnerability assessment (aggregated peril-score compiling
the overall multi-natural-hazard exposure to future climate). Once finalized, the detailed results (with
site specific areas of focus) were communicated to all relevant internal stakeholders at corporate
levels. Priority sites were identified based on these results. These sites provided a preliminary view
on existing climate change adaptation efforts based on their exposure and will continue working on
a more detailed roadmap in terms of climate change adaptation.
climate change adaptation;
sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources;
pollution prevention and control regarding use and presence of chemicals;
protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems; and
circular economy.
163 ST 2024 Sustainability report

Page 164:
The outcome of this analysis confirmed our compliance with the DNSH criterion in connection with
climate change adaptation.
Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources
We have completed an environmental assessment for all our manufacturing sites and main R&D
centers and have a view at site and corporate levels on the risks associated with the preservation of
the water quality and the prevention of water stress. As part of our environmental processes, we
have actions plan in place to address the risks identified to ensure that deterioration is avoided.
All our manufacturing sites and several of our key sites of R&D are ISO 14001 certified for our
environmental management system. Most manufacturing and R&D sites are EMAS validated.
The outcome of this analysis confirmed our compliance with the DNSH criterion in connection with
sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources.
Pollution prevention and control regarding use and presence of chemicals
Managing chemical substances and materials used in our manufacturing sites is critical for
protecting people, preserving the environment, and complying with legal and customer
requirements. Accordingly, for all materials including chemicals and gases entering at any of our
sites, a site chemical committee authorizes the use and evaluates the best management solutions,
both for new processes and modification of existing processes. In addition, since 1996 we have
defined our environment, health and safety regulated substances list detailing the substances,
which use is prohibited and those which use is restricted to selected applications only and/or is
subject to strict measures (seeChemicals).
The review performed for the DNSH assessment was done at substance level in order to evaluate if
our activities do not lead to the manufacture, placing on the market or use of the listed substances
as reflected in the relevant DNSH – criteria following from the EU Taxonomy Delegated Act. For
each of the requirements following from the DNSH-criteria a detailed evaluation was carried out
comparing the requirements to the current situation in our manufacturing sites and subcontracted
manufacturing activities. This analysis included an assessment of the manufacturing-related raw
materials delivered to all our sites. For the financial year 2023, we have considered the updated
Appendix of the DNSH pollution leading to an adjustment of our approach compared to the financial
year 2022.
A detailed assessment was performed at product line level in order to exclude associated revenues
not compliant with the Appendix C paragraphs and to enable consistency with the approach taken
for turnover. Notably, exclusions were performed when substances of very high concern were above
the threshold as included in Appendix C or when not in compliance with the regulations and
directives mentioned in Appendix C. We used the possibility to consider compliance in case there is
no technical alternative available on the market and that those substances are used under
controlled conditions, only for one substance – Lead – used in our manufacturing process. ST is a
member of the Die Attach5 consortium which seeks to standardize solutions for lead-free solders
for attaching dies to packages during manufacturing, however at this stage Lead used in the semi-
conductor industry does not have currently a suitable alternative available on the market.
The outcome of this analysis confirmed that most of our product lines are compliant with the EU
Taxonomy Regulation. However, part of our turnover was excluded notably due to the use of
substances of very high concern above the mentioned threshold. Alternatives are constantly being
further investigated in our manufacturing processes or products. This may result in adjustment of
this assessment and related reporting in the future.
Consistent with the approach defined for the turnover, the investment supporting product lines not
compliant with DNSH on pollution prevention were excluded from the Taxonomy-alignment of the
capital expenditure and any R&D project linked to a product line not compliant as per the DNSH on
pollution prevention was excluded from the Taxonomy-alignment of the operating expenditure.
Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems
We have completed an environmental assessment for all our manufacturing sites and main R&D
centers. All the sites have put in place policies on the impact of their activities on the environment
and maintain a system to monitor and manage such impact. In addition, we commissioned a
specific study from an external provider to provide an assessment on the biodiversity and
ecosystems in the areas close to our sites and operations. Our sites were assessed from our front-
164 ST 2024 Sustainability report

Page 165:
end and back-end activities, along with three R&D and design centers. To date, several initiatives
have been carried out to protect biodiversity of the areas around our sites (e.g. low mowing or
insect hotels). Certain sites have defined biodiversity targets and started the evaluation of the
diversity of species in their vicinity.
Based on the outcome of the specific biodiversity and ecosystems study, ongoing efforts are taken
at our sites to assess enhanced potential mitigation measures to further protect the environment
(seeBiodiversity).
The outcome of this analysis confirmed our compliance with the DNSH criterion in connection with
protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.
Circular economy
We have deployed several actions to promote the reuse and use of secondary raw materials and
reused components in manufactured products. Our recycling solution for silicon for example allows
avoiding extraction and transportation of silicon. Furthermore, our scrap of silicon is valorized in a
foundry where when added to aluminum it is then used in automotive, aeronautics and solar panel
manufacturing (seeWaste).
Our waste management process prioritizes recycling over disposal, in the manufacturing process.
Action plans have been defined at site level to increase the recycling rate. These actions are verified
during RBA, ISO 14001 or EMAS audits. First actions have been implemented to reduce the
packaging, then the remaining waste is compressed and recycled. Several initiatives are in place,
for example, some of our wafers and frame packing are returned to suppliers and reused by them,
or our carton waste resulting from material packaging is sent for recycling.
Information on and traceability of substances of concern throughout the life cycle of the
manufactured products are notably performed through material declaration forms. Our analysis as
part of the DNSH pollution prevention also demonstrates our ability to identify the substance
present in our processes or in products.
The outcome of this analysis confirmed our compliance with the DNSH criterion in connection with
circular economy.
Minimum Safeguards
The last pillar of the Taxonomy-alignment assessment relates to the compliance with minimum
safeguards. We have performed a detailed analysis of the following regulations: the OECD
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and
Human Rights, including the principles and rights set out in the eight fundamental conventions
identified in the Declaration of the International Labour Organization on Fundamental Principles and
Rights at Work and the International Bill of Human Rights. Our review also included the EU Charter
of Fundamental Rights and the European Pillar of Social Rights. Our financial year 2022 analysis
was reviewed and updated for financial year 2023, considering the FAQ published by the European
Commission in October 2022 with additional analysis performed on Corruption, Taxation and Fair
competition criteria. Our 2023 assessment also took into account the updated version of the OECD
guidelines published in 2023.
Our analysis was performed on our own operations based on internal audit (e.g. for taxation),
procedures (e.g. corporate labor and human rights), programs (e.g. ST anticorruption program),
policies (e.g. speak up policy) and our code of conduct in place. We also assessed our supply chain
with a focus on subcontractors and high risk/strategic suppliers (according to the spend level, the
nature of the activity, and the geographical location of the supplier) and other business relationships
with a focus on our main customers which are RBA members. The analysis was performed and
discussed with the relevant experts and senior level stakeholders within ST.
The outcome of this analysis confirmed our compliance with the minimum safeguards.

Turnover
The proportion of turnover from products associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities reached 12% for the financial year 2023, compared to 9% in 2022. The increase is
driven by the combined effects of the introduction of a threshold in the Annex C of the DNSH pollution and the wider coverage of life-cycle assessments as described in section 3.4.6.4
of our 2023 Statutory Annual Report, including IFRS Financial Statements, available oninvestors.st.com  .

We are proactively addressing the transition to a lower-carbon economy in our
corporate strategy.
Based on the risk management process described below, we act on the most
material risks and opportunities such as climate change mitigation and adaptation,
water challenges and positive impact opportunities both in communities where we
operate and markets we serve.
Simultaneously, we are actively investing in developing and launching new products
to help our customers implement new energy-saving and substantial GHG reduction
applications.

Company-level sustainability risks are addressed by our Enterprise Risk Management
program, which is aligned with ISO 31000. We have deployed a process to
continuously identify and assess policy, legal, technology, and market transition risks,
across the short-, medium- and long-terms.
In 2023, we commissioned an update of the science-based study from AXA Climate
to assess the current and future climate risks on our 155 most critical locations (ST
and partner sites in 25 countries). In addition to these global analyses, we also carry
out site-specific studies on natural hazards, according to local conditions.
Our various climate-related analyses inform our site-level business interruption risk
assessments and business impact analyses, as well as our site resilience index.
Ultimately, they feed into our regularly updated improvement, mitigation, and
adaptation plans, helping us address environmental and resilience issues in the
medium to long term.

EU Taxonomy
ST follows the GHG Protocol for managing and reporting its GHG emissions on which
we are fully certified ISO 14064. Our roadmap to carbon neutrality by 2027 includes
two 2025 specific targets validated by the Science Based Targets initiative: 50%
reduction of direct and indirect emissions compared to 2018, and the sourcing of
80% renewable energy.
As an intermediate product manufacturer, we enable the manufacturing of low-carbon
technologies. Our activities which aim at contributing to climate change mitigation
and climate change adaptation, are the manufacturing of electronic components that
enable other sustainable economic activities and applications.For the financial year
2023, the proportion of turnover from products associated with Taxonomy-aligned
economic activities reached 12% compared to 9% in 2022.
