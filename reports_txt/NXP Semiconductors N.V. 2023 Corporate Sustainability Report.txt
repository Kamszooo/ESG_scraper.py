environmental footprints, and included their 
performance in our supplier rating to derive action plans.
Integrate ESG into our 
business so we can foster 
ownership and accountability
We continued to drive the company wide ESG Program 
involving all functions and with clear roles and 
responsibilities, embedding sustainability in all the 
relevant areas of our business. 
 
for 2023
Since 2022, so as to reinforce our corporate commitment to these ideals, we have 
added a sustainability component to our short-term Annual Incentive Plan (AIP). As 
part of this effort, NXP introduced a sustainability scorecard, which contains multiple 
metrics intended to measure our year-on-year progress toward our long-term 
aspirations relating to people and the environment. We encourage all team members 
to participate in this progress and, as a result, have made the scorecard part of the AIP 
for all team members. The sustainability component has a weighting of 20% in our AIP.

Objectives and Certifications
As an environmentally responsible manufacturer committed to 
continuous improvement, we strive to optimize our use of natural 
resources, emissions to the environment and achieve operational 
efficiencies. To support these objectives, we maintain and implement 
an environmental management system. 
In accordance with criteria from the International Organization of 
Standardization (ISO), our Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) 
management system is certified to both ISO 14001 and ISO 45001  
at all our manufacturing sites as well as our headquarters. 
Roadmap to Carbon Neutrality
Our goal to be carbon neutral by 2035 
presents multiple layers of complexity, 
given that we use renewable and non-
renewable electricity, fossil fuels, PFCs 
and HTFs. By 2027, our mid-term goal 
is to reduce Scope 1 and 2 absolute 
emissions by 35% from a 2021 baseline. 
To reach our mid-term goal, we 
will address Scope 1 reduction 
by focusing on designing and/
or installing equipment to reduce 
emissions, substituting chemicals and 
optimizing manufacturing processes. 
Since electricity is our largest GHG 
contributor, another of our mid-term 
goals is to increase our renewable 
electricity use to 50% and thereby 
decrease our Scope 2 emissions.
Scope 3 Assessment
2023 marked the first time we made a 
detailed inventory of all 15 categories 
of Scope 3, mapping NXP’s footprint 
throughout our entire value chain. Our 
Scope 3 emissions are understandably 
larger than our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, 
given that Scope 3 emissions represent 
an impact beyond our operations. While 
we will remain focused on our Scope 
1 and 2 decarbonization efforts, we 
will also work to establish methods to 
reduce our Scope 3 footprint, and will 
also set Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 
SBTs in 2024.

NXP Executive Summary: 2023 Corporate Sustainability Report
We take a three-pronged approach to 
carbon reduction: 1) reduce, remove 
or replace chemicals with a high 
global-warming potential (GWP) 
in our manufacturing processes, 2) 
lower our absolute and normalized 
energy consumption and 3) execute 
our carbon-free energy transition 
plan. This approach helps us achieve 
carbon neutrality while reducing or 
even eliminating our carbon offsets in 
the future.  Since 2013, we’ve lowered 
absolute emissions by 42%.
Emissions Energy
To increase our access to renewable 
energy, solar installations are underway 
in our Bangkok, Thailand, Kuala Lumpur, 
Malaysia and Kaohsuing, Taiwan 
locations. This renewable electricity will 
be used to offset some of the higher 
carbon-content electricity available 
from local utilities. We are evaluating 
similar installations at our other 
locations.

NXP Executive Summary: 2023 Corporate Sustainability Report
We understand that, in addition to 
impacting our manufacturing sites, 
water availability also impacts other 
industrial, agricultural and residential 
users in the communities where we 
operate. By using less water, we can 
help increase the supply for others 
in our communities. Our decade-
long focus on water conservation 
has emphasized the use of more 
efficient tools, taking advantage 
of opportunities to increase water 
recycling and finding ways to optimize 
processes. A large part of our water 
consumption is fixed, such as the use of 
water for chillers, plating and cleaning. 
In addition to our water recycling 
efforts, we are looking at options to 
reduce the overall water consumption.
Water Waste
We are committed to reducing the 
amount of waste we send to landfill 
and work to recycle/reuse the 
waste we generate. We continue to 
collaborate with our supply chain 
to identify opportunities for waste 
reduction or alternative use and look 
for ways to reduce manufacturing 
waste by improving yield, optimizing 
processes and minimizing the waste  
of scrap material.

The waste by-product of chip manufacturing, usually called “sludge,” consists of water and 
particles of various materials that could be hazardous to the environment if not contained. 
Reducing and repurposing sludge is a thorny technical challenge for the semiconductor 
industry. 
NXP’s facility in Taiwan is making meaningful progress addressing this challenge. The team 
is working with a third-party partner to process its sludge and extract minerals, including 
recovering refined copper which is sold and used by other manufacturers. The facility has 
increased their waste recycling rate to above their 92% target, while processing remaining 
waste in innovative ways.

to engagement and development, we want our team members to 
grow, progress and advance across job types, functions, organizations, 
geographies and levels — all at a pace that is unique to the individual.
In our 2023 survey, we solicited input 
from all NXP team members. Ninety 
percent of team members participated 
in the survey with Ethics, Collaboration, 
Engagement and DE&I being the 
four categories with the highest 
favorability ratings. The survey results 
showed an increase in team-member 
engagement, with 70% of our team 
members being highly engaged. The 
results also show NXP’s commitment 
to shape the organization’s culture 
through our values, with 89% believing 
that NXP is a great place to work.

Awards and Recognition
In 2023, NXP partnered with a third-party vendor to launch the Great Place to Work Survey, 
inviting team members to share insights that speak to the company’s workplace culture 
and team-member experience. A great place to work is one where employees trust their 
managers and leaders, are proud of their work, like collaborating with their colleagues, and 
experience an engaging workplace environment. The survey launched in four countries and 
culminated with NXP being certified as a 2023 Great Place to Work in China, India, Mexico and 
the United States. In 2024, NXP plans to continue the momentum and survey team members 
in 13 additional countries.

At NXP, inclusion is key to living our core 
values, which are built on a foundation 
of trust and respect. We recognize 
the importance of representation, 
value diversity, equality and inclusion 
(DE&I) and respect the unique talents, 
experiences, backgrounds, cultures and 
ideas of our team members. We invite 
everyone to be their authentic selves 
at work, without exception. This is what 
makes us who we are at NXP. 
To support an inclusive environment 
and create more awareness about 
unconscious bias, we deployed 
unconscious bias to all managers 
within the company with 88% 
completing the training.
We monitor gender statistics globally, 
across all roles and look for continuous 
improvements, which include an 
evaluation of the practices at the 
country level. Women in R&D roles 
increased by 1% over the prior year, 
resulting in 20% representation. In 
support of our aspirational goal of 
increasing representation of women 
we have implemented development 
programs and retention strategies. 
Using feedback from our Winning 
Culture Survey, roundtable discussions 
and exit interviews, we took action to 
improve retention. We reduced the 
overall attrition  of women, and saw  
a reduction in the attrition of women  
in R&D from 7.7% in 2022 to 4.6%  
in 2023.
