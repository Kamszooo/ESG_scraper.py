Economic Performance 
At Photon Energy Group, we have adopted a set of values to 
ensure that our work provides consistent, long-term benefits to 
the people and communities where we operate, and the world 
at large. These values translate into a sustainable business 
model based on strong governance practises, strong social con-
duct and engagement with our stakeholders to achieve our mu-
tual sustainability goals. 
As for our economic performance in 2023, we admit it was a 
challenging year, with a turbulent macroeconomic and geopo-
litical situation, high inflation and high interest rates. On the en-
ergy market, we observed falling energy prices and fierce 
competition in PV component trading. Despite these adversi-
ties, we managed to achieve the largest increase in generation 
capacity in the history of Photon Energy Group, with a total ca-
pacity of 35.4 MWp commissioned within the year. An addi-
tional capacity of 16.2 MWp was technically constructed and in 
the commissioning process at the start  of 2024. This capacity 
expansion resulted in a significant growth of clean energy gen-
eration up from 121.6 GWh to 139.8 GWh, +15.0% YoY and this 
trend shall continue this year.  
Another major achievement in 2023 was securing 389 MW of 
contracts for DSR services, with contracted revenues of approx-
imately EUR 26 million in 2024. DSR services, which support grid 
flexibility by changing the energy consumption, will contribute 
positively to our bottom line and are expected to become the 
second largest revenue pillar within the Group.  
Our EPC business for commercial and industrial (C&I) clients 
also expanded last year, with revenues nearly doubling those of 
2022. Significant ongoing contract negotiations for 2024 con-
tinue, mainly in Australia, the Czech Republic and Romania. In 
January 2024, we signed our first 20 -year on -site Power Pur-
chase Agreement (PPA) for the construction of a 6 58 kWp PV 
power plant. We expect behind -the-meter contracts such as 
this to become another significant growth driver going forward.  
Our O&M segment, which has historically increased by low-dou-
ble digits annually, flourished in 2023, expanding its contractual 
portfolio by nearly 300 MWp, 77.3% year-on-year.  
Last but not least, in the segment of PFAS remediation we have 
seen positive developments. Our pilot trial with Australian De-
partment of Defence demonstrated a reduction in PFAS  con-
centration of up to 80 -100% from initial levels. This proves the 
efficacy of our proprietary in-situ nano-remediation technology 
in addressing PFAS contamination and we intend to accelerate 
our commercialisation efforts in 2024. 
To sum up, in 2023 we recorded consolidated revenues of 
70.649 million EUR ( -25.7% YoY) compared to 95.136 million 
EUR the previous year, mainly due to lower generation reve-
nues, down by -39.3% YoY to EUR 21.407 million. Other reve-
nues also declined by -17.8% to EUR 49.242 million, as revenues 
from our DSR and energy trading as well as EPC and O&M con-
tracts were not able to compensate fully for the contraction of 
our PV technology trading business.  
EBITDA recorded a significant decline (-84.8 % YOY), while EBIT 
present a loss of EUR -5.196 million. The decline in EBIDTA was 
primarily attributed to lower electricity prices and deterioration 
of volumes, and margins in PV component trading business. At 
the bottom line, the Group recorded a net loss of -15.750 mil-
lion EUR compared to a profit of 6.262 million EUR in 2022. In 
addition to the decline in revenues and the deterioration in 
profitability, this was affected by higher financial costs resulting 
from the increased levels of bank financing. 
We expect 2024 to bring a financial turnaround from the top 
down to the bottom line. In order to stabilise revenues  from 
electricity generation and mitigate the risks of further energy 
price fluctuations, we have taken a decision to return to feed-in 
tariffs in the Czech Republic and Hungary. Revenues from DSR 
services will triple year-on-year resulting in our New Energy di-
vision becoming profitable this year.  
EPC revenues from C&I clients will increase further compared 
to the level achieved in 2023 thanks to a backlog of contracts 
already signed or under negotiations. Growth of revenues from 
the O&M segment will be driven by our recent capacity expan-
sion, while the bottom line for this segment might finally turn 
green for the first time in our history.  We also expect to mone-
tise our project development efforts and finalise the sale of PV 
projects in Romania and Poland.  
In other segments which include water and remediation, we can 
realistically expect our first commercial projects related to PFAS 
to be concluded in Australia and Europe during the course of 
2024. We are working towards becoming a self-sustaining busi-
ness based on what we sell and deliver to our external clie nts 
in a recurring manner, with the spirit that has turned Photon 
Energy Group and its business lines into respected brands in 
the markets where we operate. We aim to expand recurring 
stream of revenues through the combination of high -perfor-
mance PV generation and storage assets, combined with the 
enhanced ability to access the full revenue stack available to 
grid-connected energy storage assets.

It’s also central to the continual growth and success of any busi-
ness. A key element of our increasing focus on sustainability is 
the development of strong ESG practices. 
Our sustainability plans are implemented by the  Sustainability 
department in cooperation with representatives from several 
business units and in close cooperation with the top manage-
ment (the Management Board and the CFO).  
We understand our responsibility to ensure that our work pro-
vides consistent, long-term benefits to the people and commu-
nities impacted by our work and to the world at large. This belief 
is fundamental to our ethical principles and is essential for our 
ongoing success and the growth of our business. As such, we

1.5 Our Key Stakeholders 
The Group’s sustainability goals can only be achieved by work-
ing closely with our stakeholders, which include our employees, 
clients, suppliers,  investors, and communities . Through em-
powering our employees, engaging with our clients and suppli-
ers, creating an open dialogue with the communities impacted 
by our activities, and with the support of our investors, we can 
shape how we define and execute our strategy to create a sus-
tainable future for generations to come.  
Our Employees 
Our employees are our most important asset, representing 26 
nationalities working at more than 10 sites in 9 countries, 
across three continents. We aim to be a top employer and offer 
our employees valuable opportunities to grow personally and 
professionally. The health and safety, equity and inclusion of 
our people is our highest priority, and we aspire to provide an 
incident- and injury-free working environment for everyone. 
Our Clients 
Our clients are one of our most important external stakeholder 
groups. The greater number of sustainable solutions we can 
provide to our clients , the more sustainable our business be-
comes. This requires a comprehensive understanding of our cli-
ents’ specific needs. Our sales teams have a well -established 
relationship with our clients, and industry associations provide 
us with markets insights.  
Our Suppliers 
We rely on the technology, equipment and services supplied by 
our key business partners. We work closely to develop and im-
prove long-term synergies. We are aware of the environmental 
impact of our sourcing  of raw materials as well as production 
processes. We clearly communicate our goals through our 
Third-party Conduct Principles and expect our suppliers to re-
duce their potential impacts on environment and communities.  
Our Investors 
Our financial partners, shareholders and bondholders play a 
significant role in the Company’s growth and success. They sup-
port us in our pursuit of a long -term-oriented strategy which 
aims to continually create value for shareholders while offering 
a low-risk environment for debt holders. With our financial in-
struments listed on financial markets, we provide transparent 
communication and share key business developments  by up-
keeping and continuously developing our website, providing an 
Investor Relations newsletter, and hosting live webcasts to pre-
sent the Company’s quarterly results. 
Communities 
We engage with communities on multiple levels, from local au-
thorities and residents living near our PV installations to collab-
orations with universities and research institutes. We also 
engage in philanthropic and sponsorship activities,  docu-
mented by our Donation and CSR Policy, including CSR Days of-
fered to employees. As outlined in our Code of Ethics and

1.6 Prioritising Sustainability
In adopting a strategic approach to sustainability, we address 
material external risks, helping us to become more resilient and 
adaptable in the face of challenges such as climate change, and 
creating a space for new ideas and creative responses. We fos-
ter innovative  solutions that will ultimately position us as a 
thought leader in our industry.  
Material topics are identified and prioritised to ensure that both 
the potential impact on the business and the impact of the busi-

and internal strategic priorities form our analysis and shape our 
materiality areas and criteria. Each topic is defined by our poli-
cies and strategies, with our performance being evaluated and 
reported on periodically.  
Sustainability Management 
In 2020, we laid the foundation for strategic management, con-
trolling and reporting practices that are fully geared toward sus-
tainability. A Sustainability department was created to work 
closely with the Board of Directors and representatives from 
several business units within the Company. The objective of the 
department is to monitor the strategic coordination of the Com-
pany’s sustainability plans.  
Our sustainability strategy creates a cohesive purpose, provid-
ing a link throughout the business that employees can identify 
with, as can potential employees, who are increasingly seeking 
purpose-driven organisations  to work with. Another core as-
pect of our strategy involves engaging and supporting the com-
munities in which we operate. The human focus of our work is 
an integral component of our drive to ensure the continued 
success and positive impact of our activities.  
Our sustainability strategy defines our reputation in the market. 
By displaying our values, the dedication towards sustainability 
development is also exhibited to customers, suppliers, and 
shareholders.

2. Environment 
Environmental sustainability is the foundation of our business model. All our work and 100% of our revenue is connected to activities 
that add sustainable value to the environment.
Our Environmental Priorities 
To conduct our business responsibly, we have prioritised the 
following long-term environmental principles, in line with vari-
ous international organisations including the EU taxonomy ob-
jectives and the sustainable development goals of the United 
Nations: 
► Climate change mitigation through the delivery of af-
fordable and clean energy and the development of 
green energy systems including energy storage.  
► Innovation to enhance the efficiency of infrastruc-
tures by developing new solutions and relying on part-
nerships with organisations such as RayGen, our new 
investee, as a priority.  
► Helping to make cities and communities sustaina-
ble by developing and operating environmentally 
friendly and minimized emissions power plants. 
► Contribution to a healthy ecosystem by conducting 
environmental impact studies prior to the installation of 
power plants.  
► Enhancing biodiversity by working proactively on pro-
jects that are beneficial to local ecosystems and wildlife. 
► The sustainable use of water through the delivery of 
water treatment solutions, the conservation of water, 
and a range of remediation services to eliminate con-
taminants from groundwater and the environment. 
2.1 Environmental Commitments  
Beyond our work developing solar energy and clean water solutions, we have various policies in place to ensure that our dedication to 
environmental causes is also reflected in our internal practices. 
 
 
► All of our field operations are subject to local environ-
mental regulations, which we strictly adhere to.  
► When disposing of waste, all recyclable materials such 
as metal, wood, plastic, glass, and paper are sorted and 
recycled. 
► We generally do not use chemical fertilisers or pesti-
cides for landscape management. 
► For the cleaning of PV panels, we use only demineral-
ised water, no chemical agents. 
► When clearing land to construct new power plants, we 
conduct in -depth biodiversity studies and implement 
measures to ensure that any unavoidable impact is min-
imised or reversed. 
 
2.2 Carbon Footprint 
Making a positive contribution to carbon reduction to mitigate 
climate change is our top priority.  
The aim of our core business is to reduce carbon released dur-
ing electricity generation. In 2023, our solar power plants gen-
erated 139.8 GWh of clean electricity  and 58,286 tonnes of 
CO2e emissions were avoided as compared to conventional 
electricity production. This figure represents carbon emissions 
avoided annually by replacing the equivalent quantity of elec-
tricity generated from conventional electricity generation  with 
clean generation from PV power plants. This equivalent quan-
tity is based on the total production of our proprietary portfolio 
of power plants. The calculation is updated annually and utilises 
a carbon emissions factor. The emission factor considers the 
combined margin grid emission factor for countries in which 
Photon Energy Group operates and owns PV power plants.  
Scope 1 emissions correspond directly to emissions from 
sources owned or controlled by the Group. In 2023, the assess-
ment focussed on our car fleet, comprised of 136 vehicles. 
Scope 2 emissions are detailed as indirect emissions produced 
by electricity consumption at our offices. 
Scope 3 emissions cover purchased goods and services, capital 
goods, fuel, and energy -related emissions which are not in-
cluded in Scope 1 or 2  emissions, transport and distribution, 
waste, business travel, and commuting of our employees. 
As part of our ESG strategy, it is important to record and reduce 
the carbon emissions of our own activities. To date, we have in-
itiated the implementation of an integrated approach to calcu-
late and monitor our carbon footprint.  In the first phase of this 
approach, starting from 2021 we evaluated the CO2e emissions 
scope 1 and 2 emissions connected to our activities.

Scope 1 and 2 Emissions 
In 202 3, total scope 1 and 2 emissions amounted to 670.8 
tonnes of CO 2e, representing a 64% increase from 202 2. This 
increase is consistent with our reported business growth,  
changes in the methodology of our carbon footprint calculation, 
increased number of employees ( +58.2% YOY) and an ex-
panded number of offices.  Photon Energy Group aims to im-
prove monitoring practices and the closeness at which 
company car fleets are examined.  For example, company cars 
are tested regularly to eliminate excess emissions due to me-
chanical dysfunctions. At the time of this report’s publication, 
this fleet includes 5 hybrid vehicles, two more than the 2022 re-
porting year, and two fully electric vehicles. By choosing electric 
vehicles over traditional combustion engine vehicles, we are re-
ducing our carbon footprint and support a sus tainable future. 
In total, a 34,158 kilometres of distance travelled by our electric 
vehicles in 2023, our adoption of electric vehicles has led to a 
avoided fuel consumption of approxima tely 2000 liter in total 
and reduction of 157,823 grams of CO2e emissions, compared 
to traditional combustion engine vehicles. 
Selected Scope 3 Areas 
Photon Energy Group tracks and accounts for various sources 
of emissions, including business travels, commuting, and pro-
curement-related activities. Our commitment to transparency 
and environmental responsibility drives us to provide infor-
mation and data on our carbon footprint.  
In 2023, our business travel encompassed flights, train and bus 
tickets, rental cars, and costs associated with the use of private 
vehicles for business purposes. The total distance covered  
amounted to 1,285,497.2 km, resulting in 260.6 tonnes of CO2e 
emissions. 
Estimation from the 2023 commuting survey, we estimated that 
Photon Energy Gorup employees travel an average distance of 
14.5 kilometres per day, utilising various modes of transport in-
cluding cars, foot, bike, or public transport, with 4% opting for 
foot or bike travel. For the reporting year 2023, the total emis-
sion from employee commuting were estimated at 314 tonnes 
of CO2e.  
Procurement related emissions constitute a significant portion 
of our upstream value chain emissions. Specifically, freight 
emission attributed to the transportation of equipment pu r-
chased by our technology team for the construction of proprie-
tary PV power plants or for our technology distribution 
activities. As part of emission reduction strategy, we have taken 
steps to reduce CO2e emissions associated with freight by sub-
stituting heavy trucks with trains in some instances, resulting in 
lower emissions.  
Looking ahead, we are revising our scope 3 emission calculation 
methodology to provide more accurate and comprehensive re-
porting. These efforts represent a significant step forward in 
our carbon reduction targets and our commitment to sustaina-
ble practices. Moving into subsequent phases of our carbon 
emissions reporting program, data will encapsulate complete 
scope 3 emission or indi rect emissions. This reporting will in-
clude emissions associated the value chain, including both up-
stream and downstream emissions.

2.3 Waste Management  
Both on-site and in our offices, we aim at maximising recycling 
and to minimising non-recyclable waste. All waste is separated 
and disposed of accordingly, in our installations and in our of-
fices.  
On-site Waste Management 
Our field operations adhere to local environmental regulations, 
emphasizing the importance of responsible waste manage-
ment practices. Recyclable materials such as metal, wood, plas-
tic, glass, and paper are diligently sorted and recycled. 
Ecologically sound disposal methods are employed for PV com-
ponents, ensuring environmental responsibility throughout our 
operations. 
At Photon Energy Group, we recognise the critical importance 
of effective waste management in fostering environmental 
sustainability. To this end, we have implemented an Extended 
Producer Responsibility (EPR) system for on -site construction 
waste management. This proactive approach ensures  the ap-
propriate waste collection and reusing or recycling of waste 
generated during the construction of our PV power plants, min-
imising our environmental impact and promoting the circular 
economy. 
Our dedication to sustainable waste management not only 
aligns with our values but also contributes to the preservation 
of natural resources, the protection of ecosystems, and the pro-
motion of a healthier environment for current and future gen-
erations. 
During the construction phase of Faget, Calafat, Magureni, Auid, 
Teius, Siria and Sahateni PV power plants in  Romania, 47.9 
tonnes of waste were collected and either reused or recycled.

Through partnerships with certified waste management facili-
ties, we strive to divert as much waste as possible from landfills. 
Office Waste Management  
In 2021, we conducted a comprehensive review of waste man-
agement practices across the five offices housing more than 
90% of our employees. This review involved preparing an inven-
tory of the types of waste produced by each office, along with a 
detailed description of current waste management, reuse, recy-
cling, and sorting practices. The identified categories of waste  
and recyclable materials include organic waste, soft plastic, 
metal, hard plastic, glass, paper, electronic waste, and other 
non-recyclable materials. Through this process, areas for im-
provement were identified, and we are in the process of estab-
lishing revised waste prevention rules to address them. 
In collaboration with our third -party supplier, we have imple-
mented a convenient solution for the disposal of used toners 
and cartridges at each printer in our Prague office. Specifically, 
we have placed boxes for collecting used toners and cartridges, 
which can also accommodate cartridges from personal home 
printers. The contents of these boxes are ecologically disposed 
of or recycled for reuse, aligning with our commitment to envi-
ronmental sustainability and responsible waste management 
practices. 
At Photon Energy Group, we are committed to sustainability 
and environmental stewardship. Through our collaboration 
with EKO-KOM, a leading packaging waste management com-
pany, we actively participate in a comprehensive system for 
sorting and recycling packaging waste in the Czech Repulic. By 
partnering with EKO-KOM, we ensure that our waste is collected 
and utilized in accordance with legal requirements, contributing 
to the circular economy and reducing environmental impact. 
Together, we play a vital role i n establishing an efficient waste 
management system, facilitating the recycling or energy recov-
ery of over 80% of single -use packaging annually. Our dedica-
tion to responsible waste management aligns with our core 
values, and we continue to prioritise sustainable practices in all 
aspects of our operations. 
 
2.4 Photon Energy Group Grows Sustainably  
New Office in Romania 
In October 2023, Photon Energy Romania relocated to a new 
office. The office is located within a building which earned a 
BREEAM certificate 5-star rating in 2022. Additionally, it holds a 
Well Health-Safety Rating from the Well Building Institute, en-
suring a healthy and safe environment for occupants. 
The new office embraces sustainability by incorporating renew-
able energy sources, including solar panels for hot water, effec-
tively reducing the carbon footprint.  The extensive natural 
lighting facilitated by expansive windows  enhance the energy 
efficiency and employee ’s well-being. Conveniently situated 
near amenities such as public transportatio n. Tenants benefit 
from underground parking facilities, further enhancing  its ac-
cessibility.  
This move strengthens Photon Energy Group’s presence in Ro-
mania, whilst supporting future growth capacity and being well 
aligned with our culture of sustainability.  
Reducing Emissions, Fostering Community, and Enhancing 
Sustainability 
As part of our ongoing efforts to reduce our carbon footprint, 
the 2023 Christmas celebration was held locally to minimise 
emissions from business travels. All employees enjoyed the 
online all-staff meeting and local Christmas parties in their re-
spective countries of operation. The events were organised lo-
cally, and employees attended the all -staff meeting virtually. 
This initiative reflects Photon Energy Group 's commitment to 
decreasing our carbon footprint and mitigating the potential 
negative impact of business travels. 
Promoting Reuse 
In 2023, as part of our ongoing commitment to sustainability, 
we initiated a program to offer office furniture to our employ-
ees, free of charge. This proactive measure aimed to promote 
the ethos of reuse, emphasising its importance in our sustaina-
bility strategy. By providing employees with access to pre -
owned office furniture, we aimed to extend the lifecycle of 
these resources, reducing the need for recycling and minimis-
ing waste generation. This initiative not only aligns with our cor-
porate values of environmental responsibility but also fosters a 
culture of sustainability within our organization. Through en-
couraging reuse, we reduce our environmental impact but also 
contribute to the circular economy, promoting responsible re-
source management for a more sustainable future.

OVERVIEW Location: Jablanec nad Nisou, Czech Republic  
Service: Implementation of measures to improve the water quality in the Meno Reservoir 
using floating vegetation islands and the ultrasound technology eliminating cyanobacteria 
growth. Water quality monitoring in the cascade of reservoirs and at inlet.  
THE CHALLENGE Sustainable improvement of water quality for swimming, other recreational purposes, and 
water management activities. 
THE SOLUTION For the sustainable water quality improvement only the environmentally friendly methods 
are used. Our approach does not require use of any chemicals or additives and does not 
create any harmful by-products. 
The goal of the application was to reduce the presence of cyanobacteria and algae in the 
water body to an acceptable level for swimming and bathing and thus extend the swim-
ming summer season on the reservoir. 
Two floating units equipped with ultrasonic transmitters and solar panels were operated 
on the main lake. On the middle reservoir, floating vegetation islands acting as a root treat-
ment plant help with the water quality. Monitoring of the surface water qua lity in reser-
voirs during whole season was part of the solution.

Service:  Preparation of project documentation of the Bube pond reconstruction. Author’s 
supervision during implementation. 
THE CHALLENGE Revitalisation of a pond in a poor structural and technical condition. Providing new access 
to the water for the public. 
THE SOLUTION Project documentation for the overall reconstruction of the pond was prepared. It in-
cluded a project of desilting of the pond, demolition of existing objects within the flooded 
area and reconstruction of the reservoir’s fortifications and functional objects. Design also 
included a new pier making pond accessible to the public. 
Under our author’s supervision more than 700 m 3 of sediment was excavated and the 
eroded banks of the reservoir were repaired, especially the right bank wall adjacent to the 
road. The right bank was realised as a pre-cast wall with a stone face. The left bank was 
fortified by a heavy boulder. A new reinforced concrete wall of the dam and discharge 
pipe were built. Our work will continue with the construction of a fountain safety spillway, 
a descent ramp into the reservoir and a new pier.

and causes eutrophication and the development of water bloom in the summer seasons. 
Optimisation of the operation of the island system and tunning the coagulant dosage in re-
lation to the changing parameters of the flow. 
THE SOLUTION The solution consisted in the delivery, installation and operation of a mobile automated pre-
cipitation station and continuous monitoring of the physical and chemical parameters of wa-
ter in the stream. 
Advanced remote control of the operation of the precipitation station in conjunction with 
on-line monitoring enabled real-time optimisation of the amount of applied coagulant dose 
based on automatic flow measurement in the selected profile. Correct operation of the sta-
tion was remotely monitored and during the year the operation of installed power train 
(combustion engine powered generator, recharging units and set of traction batteries) was 
optimised.

PHOTON WATER 
PFAS Remediation  
 
OVERVIEW Location: Separate localities in CzechRepublic and Australia 
Service: The PFAS_Tech Project is a project focused on the development and verification of 
technologies for the remediation of per- and polyfluorinated substances (PFAS) from the en-
vironment. The project is subsidised by the TREND program of subprogramme 1, "Technolog-
ical leaders" of the Technology Agency of the Czech Republic, which supports enterprises and 
research organisations from the Czech Republic in the research and development of new 
products, production processes and services. 
THE CHALLENGE The development of innovative remediation methods for the in -situ elimination of PFAS and 
advanced technologies for water treatment. The solution directly addresses a current urgent 
threat to the environment and public health. 
THE SOLUTION The project develops and validates technologies for the remediation of PFAS, which are per-
sistent organic pollutants known for their adverse effects on health and the environment. The 
solution focuses on drinking water treatment and in-situ groundwater remediation. 
The developed small and medium-sized drinking water treatment plants combine the function 
of specific ionex with electrochemical and sorption mechanisms. 
For the in-situ remediation technologies, the research is focused on the use of modern reme-
diation methods with electrokinetic support, the description of mechanisms, and the design 
of technologies that will enable the controlled application of an electric  field to optimize the 
remediation process. In the first phase of the project, the selection of filter materials targeted 
at PFAS, the selection of pilot sites in the Czech Republic and Australia, and laboratory testing 
of technologies were carried out. Th e project will make it possible to establish operational, 
technological, and economic parameters of technologies and to optimize both the individual 
components and technology as a whole.

CASE STUDY 
PHOTON WATER 
Hydrogeological Services for a Water Utility Company 
 
OVERVIEW Location: Water source areas of Poděbrady-Kluk and Písty, Czech Republic 
Service: Repairs and regeneration of existing water wells, construction of new wells, overall 
hydrogeological service of two large water source areas 
THE CHALLENGE Restoration of the yield of water sources (wells) that are more than 50 years old. Building 
new boreholes to supply the population with drinking water. 
THE SOLUTION Hydrogeological services were implemented for the water utility company Vodovody a kan-
alizace Nymburk, which operates several water source areas and supplies approx. 60,000 
inhabitants with drinking water. 
Aging water wells, 50 years old or more, were regenerated and thus their capacities were 
either improved or restored. For wells that could not be regenerated, the life of wells was 
extended by inserting new PVC equipment into the original corroded steel equipment. 
Three new wells with a large diameter were built, from which a total of 30 l/s of groundwa-
ter can be pumped. 
A hydrogeological assessment was prepared for the extension of the permit for the 
groundwater use, including an assessment of the increase in the total volumes of pumping 
in relation to the circulation and reserves of underground and surface water in the c atch-
ment area.

2.5 Quality Control 
The highest standards of quality in our products and services 
are vital not only to our business, but to managing the environ-
mental impact of our work. In addition to our own standards 
and practices, we strictly adhere to all relevant laws and regula-
tions concerning product quality and safety. 
Practices during the development and construction of power 
plants: 
► Our assets and operations are subject to various envi-
ronmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in 
which we operate. These environmental requirements 
include ecologically responsible disposal of PV compo-
nents. Waste record keeping and the transfer  of waste 
to specialist companies with practising management 
permits in accordance with local environmental law also 
features in our quality control procedures.  
► Regular checks are made with subcontractors, including 
a Work Completion Test (WCC), Preliminary acceptance 
Test (PAC) and a Final Acceptance Test (FAC). The WCC 
consists visual inspection of all components, while the 
PAC and FAC mainly focuses on the functionality of ma-
jor components, such as the emergency off switch, 
switchboards, bus bar, circuit breakers and modules. 
The PAC test is done after commissioning and FAC test 
is done for PVPs in operation for defined period.  
Practices during the operation and maintenance of power 
plants: 
► Preventative maintenance as the central component of 
our approach. This includes targeted inspections and 
testing to ensure that any potential problems are iden-
tified and resolved before they become a fault, minimis-
ing downtime. 
► Regular technical audits, aligned with a continuous im-
provement culture, which consist of in -depth inspec-
tions and data analysis in order to assess performance, 
identify problems and implement solutions. 
► Online monitoring and analysis services for all types of 
PV projects, ensuring that system abnormalities are 
identified and rectified, and that sites run at optimal 
performance. 
Our approach to quality control allows for optimal performance 
of components by minimising operational and energy losses, 
and to ensure compliance with local government and environ-
mental regulations, thanks to our forecasting tools. 
 
2.6 Water Conservation and Management 
The conservation and the quality of water is foundational to life 
on Earth. Ensuring sufficient and consistent water supply, re-
gardless of climate and anthropogenic requirements, supports 
sustainable practice and acknowledges clean water as essential 
for a healthy world. 
We manage water consumption both in our office buildings and 
during the operation of our PV power plants. In office settings, 
water usage is minimal. Similarly, our PV power plants operate 
with low water consumption requirements. Water plays a cru-
cial role in cleaning solar modules to prevent yield reductions 
and potential damage caused by soiling. On average, approxi-
mately 738.9 liters of water per MWp was used for this purpose 
in 2023. Notably, no cleaning agents been utilised in the clean-
ing process.  
Wastewater generated in office facilities is directed to local cen-
tralised wastewater systems, complying with relevant regula-
tions for treatment and disposal.  
Photon Water’s Sustainable Solution  
On a global scale, emerging hazardous contamination threat-
ens the quality of valuable water supplies, making it imperative 
to adopt sustainable water management practices. Urgent ac-
tion is required to meet current water needs without compro-
mising the well -being of future generations. Photon Water 
addresses this demand by offering reliable remediation solu-
tions with a long-term vision. 
Photon Water specialises in managing water resources for c li-
ents, providing treatment for drinking water and wastewater. 
As a subsidiary of Photon Energy Group, Photon Water lever-
ages both innovative and traditional water treatment solutions, 
integrating them with renewable energy. 
Our approach is characterised by a considered, scientific, and 
holistic perspective, taking into account the complete project 
cycle and downstream consequences. From lake management 
to remediation, our solutions are designed to minimise environ-
mental impact and waste. For example , our  ultrasonic algae 
control target toxic al gae without negative impact on environ-
ment, without use of chemicals and harmful by-products, main-
taining natural ecosystem equilibrium.  
Transitioning from conventional pump and treat filtration to 
mobile off-grid systems to in-situ methods promote sustaina-
bility, while electrochemically enhanced remediation tech-
niques offer energy -neutral control and elimination of 
contamination. 
Through our comprehensive solutions and services, we ensure 
access to clean water for all. This includes large- and small-scale 
water treatment units, recycling of industrial wastewater, and 
treatment of liquid waste.  
Through the process of remediation, we remove harmful pollu-
tants, ensuring soil health and safe water usage. We tailor re-
mediation methods to the site and pollutants involved, guiding 
customers through every stage for the safest, most effective so-
lutions.  
PFAS and Photon Water’s Pioneering Remediation 
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) pose a significant 
environmental and human health challenge due to their persis-
tent and bioaccumulative nature. Photon Water is pioneering 
in-situ groundwater remediation targeting PFAS contamination 
through collaboration with researchers from the Technical Uni-
versity of Liberec  (TUL). By developing and applying electro-
chemically enhanced nanoremediation technology, Photon 
Water prioritises sustainability, community well -being, and 
safety.

In collaboration wit h laboratories at the Institute for Nano-
material Advance Technologies, and Innovation at TUL, Photon 
Water established the world’s first in-situ electrochemically en-
hanced nanoremediation trial sit e in Australia in November 
2020 for PFAS contamination. Initial results from this small con-
tamination hotspot align with laboratory findings, with the Aus-
tralian Department of Defence advocating for the technology.  
The site has demonstrated a reduction in PFAS concentration of 
up to 80% -100% from the initial levels. While the study focused 
on proving the efficiency and safety of the technology, ongoing 
research at TUL and the Enh anced in Situ Bioremediation for 
Contaminated Land Reme diation (EiCLaR) consortium, 
including the VEGAS Research Facility for Subsurface Remedia-
tion at the University of Stuttgart, continues to augment finding. 
Current experiments utilising in-situ technology for polychlorin-
ated ethylene (PCE) and planned experiments for PFAS contam-
ination validate the versality of Photon Water’s solution across 
various hazardous contamination types. With the increasing ur-
gency of remediation action, more projects are being deployed 
across Europe and Australia to address PFAS and other chlorin-
ated and fluorinated hydrocarbon contamination using this in-
novative in-situ remediation approach. 
 
2.7 Biodiversity 
Installing PV power plants often involves land clearing, which 
can disrupt biodiversity and lead to habitat loss for local wildlife. 
At Photon Energy Group, biodiversity considerations are inte-
gral to our environmental due diligence processes. We conduct 
baseline studies to assess potential impacts, and if unavoidable, 
we implement measures to minimise and mitigate them. 
During site clearance, we prioritise sensitive methods to mini-
mise disruption to fauna. This includes directional clearing and 
avoiding clearance during bird nesting season. Additionally, we 
take measures during construction and operation phases such 
as fencing off storage areas and minimising lighting to reduce 
disturbance to wildlife.  
When the impact cannot be fully mitigated, we explore options 
for habitat enhancement and the creation of new conservation 
areas to restore biodiversity levels. 
Photon Water’s Contribution to Wetland Preservation 
Awareness of wetland importance is growing globally, and Pho-
ton Water is actively involved in wetland preservation efforts. In 
collaboration with an international consortium, we are develop-
ing Wetland+ technology at Jaworzno, Poland, as part of the EU-
funded LIFEPOPWAT project. This innovative technology based 
on constructed wetlands for treatment of pesticide contami-
nated waters, aims to reduce levels of HCH, a persistent organic 
pollutant, in stream water . A form of HCH, was widely used in 
the EU as a pesticide and a treatment for lice and scabies until 
its production and application were banned in 2004. Neverthe-
less, this persistent organic pollutant still poses serious health 
risks for the residents of affected areas. 
The consortium includes partners such as the Central Mining 
Institute and city of Jaworzno  (pl. Główny Instytut Górnictwa) , 
Photon Water, along with Technical University of Liberec (Czech 
Republic), Aarhus University ( Denmark), as well as SERPOL  
France and Czech state -owned company DIAMO . The project, 
initiated in 2020, focuses on demonstrating the effectiveness of 
wetland systems and establishing replicable process, planned 
termination in December 2023. 
In addition to LIFEPOPWAT, Photon Water is involved in another 
EU-funded project to map and address HCH contamination in 
the EU. Photon Water sub -contracted by Tauw BV, a leading 
company to help with the inventorisation of HCH-contaminated 
sites in the Czech Republic and to assist one of the site owners 
with HCH-contaminated site management. This includes inven-
tory contaminated sites in the Czech Republic and assisting with 
site management.  
Partnership with Czech University of Life Sciences Prague 
Biodiversity projects are in the works at four of our power 
plants in the Czech Republic, as part of an agreement with the 
Department of Ecology of the Czech University of Life Sciences 
Prague. Currently underway is the initial phase of this long-term 
endeavor, which involves studying biodiversity characteristics 
unique to each location. Experts in insect and crop sciences are 
actively involved in identifying suitable crops for cultivation 
around the panels. 
Initiatives such as the biodiversity project we've undertaken in 
collaboration with the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague 
offer a several benefits that extend well beyond mere environ-
mental conservation. They serve as vital instruments in nurtur-
ing sustainable ecosystems and fostering the well-being of both 
wildlife and human communities. 
By thoughtfully selecting plant species and nurturing diverse 
ecosystems around our power plants, we contribute to the 
preservation and restoration of natural habitats. This proactive 
approach not only strengthens the survival of native species but 
also helps counteract the adverse effects of habitat fragmenta-
tion and loss. By promoting biodiversity, we fortify the resilience 
of ecosystem services, thereby safeguarding our planet's capac-
ity to sustain life. Integrating biodiversity into our operations 
underscores our dedication to combating climate change and 
transitioning towards a low-carbon future.
2.8 Environmental Impact  
We strive to avoid or minimise any detrimental changes to local 
landscapes. The potential negative environmental impact of our 
projects is identified during the development stage, and corre-
sponding investigations are carried out for small-scale projects. 
For larger projects, environmental impact assessments (EIS) are 
carried out. For the company's major projects in Australia, EIS’s 
are conducted at the outset. During the first year of 
development, a large amount of information on the environ-
mental impact of  each project is documented and then pub-
lished as part of the approval process. Our projects are very 
often large-scale and long-term (the life cycle of a PV installation 
is generally at least 25 to 30 years), and as such we take great 
care assessing, managing, and monitoring any possible impacts 
on local communities.

The development and construction of PV power plants and wa-
ter treatment installations can make significant impacts on local 
ecosystems, and as such are subject to stringent environmental 
regulations as well as regulatory requirements in the form of 
building permits. In Australia, development approvals for PV 
power plants are subject to public inquiry and consultation, 
which brings together representatives of central and local gov-
ernment as well as environmental and other associations. A 
dedicated website is  set up at the commencement of an Aus-
tralian project providing transparent project information to the 
public and a direct contact line during the project’s develop-
ment. 
Photon Energy Group is committed to the minimisation of our 
impact on the environment, and to ensuring the health and 
safety of communities impacted by our work, by complying with 
relevant state and local environmental policies as well as indus-
try-specific legislation. During the construction, operation, and 
maintenance of our PV power plants, we have not encountered 
any incidents or injuries impacting the communities neighbour-
ing our sites.

3. Social Conduct 
We are proud to have built a dynamic, diverse team of colleagues, comprised of 26 nationalities in locations around the world. We 
recognise this vibrant community as one of our greatest strengths, and we are dedicated to its continued enrichment. 
3.1 Social Commitments
 
 
► We have stringent health and safety policies and proce-
dures in places, and all employees are responsible for 
complying with applicable laws and regulations.  
► We embrace all forms of diversity and provide equal 
employment opportunities for all, regardless to gender, 
race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or age.  
► We provide an open, inclusive work environment, and 
discrimination of any kind is not tolerated. 
► We ensure that all employees are treated equally and 
objectively in opportunity and remuneration, using 
merit-based criteria.  
► We understand our obligation to protect the privacy of 
our customers and suppliers. We have policies and pro-
cedures in place to ensure that sensitive data is pro-
tected. This includes electronic data stored in our

community involvement and consultation.  
► When working with subcontractors, we prioritise local 
suppliers to have a positive impact on the local econ-
omy through job creation.  
3.2 Our Employees, Our Core Assets 
At the end of 202 3, Photon Energy Group had 348 employees 
(compared to 220 employees at the end of 202 2) translating 
into 338 FTE (compared to 212 FTE as of the end of 2022). This 
include the integration of Lerta in December 2022, when the 
Group’s headcount was increased to 283.  
In addition to our employees, 35 contractors worked with the 
Photon Energy Group team in 2023. These are not reflected in 
the graph below. 
 
 
Full-time equivalent (FTE) is a unit that indicates the workload of a person 
in a way that makes workloads comparable across various contexts. An FTE 
of 1.0 means that the person is equivalent to a full -time employee, while an 
FTE of 0.5 signals that the employee is only half-time. 
Talent Attraction, Retention and Development 
One of the key factors resulting in the continuous growth of 
Photon Energy Group has been the development of a culture 
that prioritises shared values and seeks to encourage the ongo-
ing well-being and development of its employees. Based on this, 
we have a two -tiered approach in our employment practices: 
attracting a strong, diverse pool of talent and encouraging pro-
fessional development. 
Our senior managers are hired from the local communities 
where we operate . We support and provide ongoing training 
and professional development, especially in areas related to 
health and safety – in particular training for accreditation for 
electrical work – workstation training for the adoption of new 
tools and the development o f other competencies such as lin-
guistic skills. In 2022, we partnered with a language school who 
runs courses year-round and deployed at a larger scale English 
and Czech language lessons for Photon Energy Group employ-
ees. In March 2022, we instituted an anti -corruption training 
program and training courses related to our Code of Ethics and 
Insider Trading.  
Employees are supported in the achievement of both personal 
and professional goals, and programs including talent develop-
ment and individual development planning. 
A p erformance review processes were initiated in 2022. The 
first phase of a review is conducted before the end of the trial 
period for new hires, and for a growing number of

Corporate number: 51447126   |   VAT number: NL850020827B01   |   +31 202 402 570   |   photonenergy.com  30/53 
departments, a performance review has been conducted annu-
ally. We introduced a new global online Performance and De-
velopment platform in 2023, to support employees and 
managers on their journey. We aim to enhance convenience 
and ensure a more efficient experience for everyone in setting 
goals and performance and development program. Our dedica-
tion to community extends beyond our company: one of our 
guiding principles is to prioritise the well-being of everyone im-
pacted by our work.  
Appropriate Remuneration 
Remuneration rates are designed to attract, retain talent, and 
reward good performance. We offer our employees a competi-
tive, performance-based remuneration system, including mar-
ket-oriented pay, individual bonuses, a long -term incentive 
plan, and project -based special payments. As outlined in our 
Code of Conduct, we are dedicated to fostering an appreciative 
and unbiased working environment. The HR department is re-
sponsible fo r overseeing the implementation of these 
measures. 
After the Lerta acquisition in December 2022, we continued to 
merge our internal process es including the remuneration sys-
tem in 2023. Furthermore, in terms of compensation , we en-
countered continual and ongoing inflationary impact as well as 
increasing competitive pressures in the labour market, where 
there was a shortage of qualified employees in the solar sector.  
Gender Pay Gap Ratio at Photon Energy Group 
At Photon Energy Group, we prioritize transparency and equity 
in our workforce practices, including the calculation of our gen-
der pay gap ratio (GPG). Our approach centers on the adjusted 
GPG, which considers factors beyond gender, such as job level 
and seniority, to provide a comprehensive understanding of in-
ternal remuneration disparities. 
To ensure accuracy, our GPG methodology involves meticulous 
data selection, acknowledging regional variations, and making 
equivalency adjustments for part-time employees. By calculat-
ing average incomes for men and women within equivalent po-
sitions and countries, we derive country -specific gender pay 
gaps, ultimately averaging these to determine the Photon En-
ergy Group adjusted GPG. 
The metho dology behind our adjusted GPG encompasses 11 
comparable positions across 4 countries including 18 women 
and 17 men. The adjusted GPG ratio in 2023 amounted to 0.3%, 
which proves that women and men are rewarded equally on 
comparable positions. This underscores our commitment to 
fostering an inclusive workplace where fairness and equality 
prevail. Through ongoing analysis and action, we strive to ad-
dress disparities and promote a culture of diversity and inclu-
sion at all levels of our organization. 
Benefit Plan Obligation and Other Retirement Plans  
Due to the continuous development of the Company (92 em-
ployees in 2018, 117 in 2019, 136 in 2021, 283 in 2022, and 348 
in 2023), we  have implemented some new benefits locally to 
support employee healthcare (medical package, sport cards, 
meal contribution) and company social responsibility (CSR Day). 
Due to experiencing several negative market trends simultane-
ously impacting our financial results, Photon Energy Group had 
to reorganize the teams and slightly decrease the number of 
employees during 2023. Severance was paid accordingly to lo-
cal legal frameworks. 
Employee Share Purchase Programme 
Our management team recognises the significant contribution 
of its employees to the development of the Group. We operate 
an Employee Share Purchase Programme both as recognition 
of employee value and as a motivational tool. Under the terms 
of the programme, the Group periodically purchases shares for 
participating employees equal to 10% of their gross compensa-
tion net of respective taxes. 
According to the Employee Share Purchase Program Policy, 
starting from 1 January 2023, participants of the Employee 
Share Purchase Programme have the right to dispose their 
shares during their employment contract, after three years of 
holding the shares. 
Compatibility of Family and Work  
Family-friendly regulations are essential for achieving optimal 
work-life balance. This entails offering flexible job arrange-
ments, including remote work options and digitized work-
places. Our home office policy, coupled with trust -based, 
flexible working hours, allows employees to work remotely, ac-
commodating their individual needs and preferences. 
Regarding parental leave, we adhere to local regulations of the 
countries we operate in  to ensure that employees are sup-
ported during significant life events. 
3.3 Corporate Social Responsibility and Employment Practices 
An important part of our mission is to empower everyone 
across the Company to help make Photon Energy Group the 
best possible organisation to work for. Key achievements from 
the past year:  
► We further improved our intranet to enable cross -bor-
der working groups, networking, and getting to know 
each other's expertise through personal and depart-
mental profiles. 
► Through regular business updates, such as our internal 
newsletter, town hall meetings and regular all -staff 
meetings and Q&A sessions with our CEO, we have 
worked hard to remain connected, open, and authentic. 
► We provided more clarity on people's roles and ac-
countabilities.  
► We continued developing our people to help them 
achieve their true potential, including the launch of our 
Training Days initiative in Europe and Australia, and reg-
ular off-site and team-building events. 
► The safety and wellbeing of our team members have 
continued to be a key focus.  
2023 Employee Engagement and ESG Survey 
The 2023 Employees Engagement and ESG Survey was con-
ducted globally in September 2023 t o gather information and 
insights from our diverse team of colleagues around the world. 
The survey ensured 100% confidentiality, with all data collected 
and analysed by an independent third party.

(OHS) is a key player in our operation. 
At Photon Energy Group, equal opportunities and respectful 
treatment are valued, with 95% agreeing and strongly agreeing 
to both aspects. Additionally, 92% of participants believe in the 
company’s commitment to confidentiality and  96% agreeing 
and strongly agreeing that  appropriate respons e would be 
taken to bribery occurrences. Notably, 92% of employees agree 
or strongly agree that equal opportunities for women exist in 
pay, promotions, and leadership roles. 
ESG is well-received, with over 92% of employees recognising 
the importance of ESG , and its  potential to enhance competi-
tiveness and how ESG and sustainability integrate into daily op-
erations. These insights provide a roadmap for maintaining 
strengths like safety programs and addressing areas needing 
enhancement, such as environmental responsibility and train-
ing clarity. Overall, the ESG and Employee Engagement Survey 
offers invaluable insights, guiding our efforts to foster a posi-
tive, inclusive workplace. 
Donation Policy and CSR Days 
At Photon Energy Group, we have a strong awareness of our 
social responsibilities and strive to make positive contributions 
to our social and ecological environments. Our Donation Policy 
details the framework governing any operation of donations, 
corporate social responsibility activities or sponsorship.  The 
purpose of the Donation Policy is to express our commitment 
to engaging in corporate social responsibility activities that are 
in line with the Group’s Sustainability Policy and Code of Ethics. 
Such activities aim to support the communities in which we op-
erate, including those who may not directly benefit from our 
primary business activities. Philanthropic donations and non -
commercial sponsorships do not provide Photon Energy Group 
with material return on investment. 
This Policy applies to all Photon Energy Group entities. The 
managing directors are responsible for ensuring the effective 
implementation of this Policy. Adhering to this Policy will be the 
responsibility of the relevant business entity seeking to organ-
ise a Donation or a Sponsorship, and as required or requested, 
in consultation with the Sustainability department.  
A new CSR Day program was launched in January 2023, as part 
of the Policy. Through this program employee can donate one 
working day to a charity of their choice, within the scope of 
the Donation Policy. Employees can use their CSR Day individu-
ally or together with a group as a team-building event. Employ-
ees are entitled to one CSR Day pre calendar year compensated 
by company.  
Volunteering provides an opportunity to give back to our com-
munities. It allows employees to contribute and make a positive 
impact, allowing to connect with people and improve our envi-
ronment. Volunteer work can also help employees learn new 
skills and can also be a great opportunity to strengthen the 
bonds within teams. 
Volunteer activities should support a charity or non -profit or-
ganisation that is aligned with certain areas, prioritised by Pho-
ton Energy Group: 
► Organisations whose work is related to the Group's 
business activities. 
► Education and R&D with a strong focus on engineering 
and technology.  
► Environmental initiatives. 
► Youth and educational development, including social in-
itiatives related to sport.

CSR Day – Supporting Community 
Throughout the year, employees at Photon Energy Group em-
braced the spirit of corporate social responsibility through var-
ious volunteer initiatives. From environmental conservation 
efforts in the Jizerské hory mountains to cultural preservation 
activities at historic sites like the Jewish cemetery in Žižkov, our 
teams demonstrated their commitment to making a positive 
impact in their communities. These endeavours reflect our ded-
ication to environmental sustainability, cultural heritage preser-
vation, and individual well-being. 
 
3.4 Community Impact 
Photon Energy Group recognises the profound impact that our 
operations can have on local communities worldwide. As a re-
sponsible global citizen, we prioritise fostering positive relation-
ships with the communities in which we operate. This section 
explores our commitment to community engagement, the tan-
gible benefits our projects bring to local areas, and our efforts 
to empower and support community development initiatives. 
From ensuring compliance with local regulations to actively con-
tributing to economic growth and social well-being, we are ded-
icated to making a meaningful and sustainable difference in the 
lives of those we serve. 
In addition to these regulatory requirements, and for every pro-
jected location worldwide, we engage in preliminary discussion 
with local authorities as a means of ensuring each project’s 
compatibility with territorial and community policies. We have 
local teams in place in every country we operate, allowing us to 
communicate with and provide information directly to local au-
thorities and residents in order to ensure the clear, accurate 
presentation of a project and its challenges. 
We believe local requirements are appropriately stringent in the 
countries where we operate, and we are not currently develop-
ing projects in any countries with a high corruption perception 
index. However, if we choose to develop projects in other coun-
tries in the future, notably emerging countries, we may go be-
yond what is required by local environmental regulations if 
deemed inadequate. In such cases, we will make use of the 
guidelines published by the International Finance Corporation 
(IFC). 
Our activities contribute to the supply of sustainable energy 
and water solutions and provide local communities the benefit 
of positive economic impacts from our projects and installa-
tions via taxes, the leasing of land and job creation. When pos-
sible, we always prefer to work with local subcontractors, as a 
contribution to the local economy. This is applicable in all our 
markets. We also strive to empower community groups and 
support intern programs to assist with our construction, tech-
nical and operational projects. 
Our approach to taxation is applied across all our locations and 
reflects our ethical guidelines. As an international organisation, 
Photon Energy Group pays taxes, duties and other contribu-
tions which may be significant in the countries in which we op-
erate. We apply tax rules rigorously and are compliant with all 
local requirements, international treaties and the guidance pro-
vided by international organisations. We only create foreign en-
tities for the purpose of developing our activities or responding 
to operating requirements. 
It is crucial for us that our facilities are integrated into nature in 
the best possible way, and that we engage in dialogue with 
members of the community. 
 
3.5 Workplace Health and Safety 
Along with sustainability  and community, safety is one of our 
core values. We place the highest value on the safety and well-
being of employees, as well as that of the communities and en-
vironments in which we operate. Our goal is for every employee 
and contractor to return home safely at the end of every day. 
We take responsibility, set requirements, and monitor health 
and safety performance in the development, construction, and 
operations phases of our projects. We define and communicate 
our standards to our employees and subcontractors. 
All our business activities are conducted in accordance with ap-
plicable labour standards and fundamental human rights 
norms as per the International Labour Organisation (ILO).  
Photon Energy Group is committed to maintaining a compre-
hensive, effective and consistent health and safety manage-
ment system across all projects. Our health and safety 
performance and objectives are monitored and evaluated inter-
nally as well as annual management reviews. 
Leading in Quality Management and Ongoing Improve-
ment  
We utilise leading indicators for monitoring activities across var-
ious business units , including tr acking incidents and 
improvement ideas, closing audits, and conducting manage-
ment inspections. Aligned with our strategies: 
► All of our Australian operating e ntities are certified to  
ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 standards. 
► Our operations and maintenance entities in the Czech 
Republic, Slovakia , Hungary and Poland are ISO 9001  
certified. Additionally, operations and maintenance  in 
the Czech Republic and Slovakia hold ISO 14001 certifi-
cation. 
► We conduct annual monitoring and ISO recertification 
every three years to ensure alignment with industry 
best practices. 
► Our OH&S portal for streamlining and management of 
documents have been enhanced in June 2023. 
► Our Romanian team have obtained ISO 9001 certifica-
tion in 2023.  
Our Strategic Direction and Objectives 
► Our main goal for 2024 is to maintain the zero fatalities 
and serious injuries. 
► Improving the quality management, health, and safety 
management system.

Photon Energy Group  Sustainability Report 2023 
Photon Energy N.V.   |   Barbara Strozzilaan 201, Amsterdam 1083 HN, The Netherlands

Our location-based work, such as the construction, operation 
and maintenance of PV power plants  prioritise addressing 
health and safety risks associated with machinery and electrical 
environment.    
Every employee is responsible for complying with applicable 
health and safety laws and following our internal policies and 
practices. If an unsafe situation is observed, the situation will be 
rectified, and we make it clear to employees that safety is our 
highest priority to ensure that they feel comfortable stopping 
unsafe work practices or assisting others in the development of 
safer practices. 
When working with subcontractors, health and safety aspects 
are considered pre-contract, and contractors are also required 
to respect all local regulatory requirements.  
During the construction of PV power plants, the project man-
ager is responsible for ensuring compliance with health and 
safety requirements by the teams under the responsibility of 
each contractor. Risks are identified, mitigated, controlled, and 
monitored. Necessary actions are taken to prevent recurrence. 
If discrepancies are noted between the required measures and 
their implementation, applicable controls may be reinforced 
and all activity at the site could potentially be suspended. Prior 
to the hiring of a new team member, our subcontractors must 
organise training related to the working environment and 
safety rules, also make them aware of any potentially hazard-
ous situations employees might encounter.  
This type of monitoring ensures that working conditions are as 
safe as possible for employees. These parameters also have a 
direct impact on the quality of service we provide, in 2023 there 
were no serious workplace accidents. 
 
3.6 Promoting Human Rights, Our Commitment and Progress 
At Photon Energy Group, we believe in upholding the dignity 
and rights of every individual across our operations and supply 
chain. We are dedicated to continuously improv ing our ap-
proach to human rights management, from implementing ro-
bust risk identification  in our supply chain  processes to 
collaborating with stakeholders on critical issues. 
In 2023, We have enhanced and fortified our supply chain due 
diligence process for third-party to integrate human rights con-
siderations into our evaluation process effectively. Additionally, 
we are introducing new documentation procedures for Know 
Your Customer (KYC) and Know Your Supplier (KYS) to further 
ensure ethical and responsible business practices. 
Throughout 2023, Photon Energy Group collaborate d with key 
stakeholders to address the alleged forced labour issues in the 
solar PV production industry. In line with our ongoing improve-
ments strategy:  
► We strive to Improve due diligence to best practice level.  
► Enhance human rights risk identification and manage-
ment processes in collaboration with all relevant units.  
► Improving the Photon Energy Group’s Environmental 
and Social Supply Chain Management System manual, 
to identify environmental and social risks, warranting a 
detailed human rights due diligence assessment.  
 
3.7 Data Privacy and Security 
We have implemented strict policies and procedures to ensure 
that sensitive data and other information valuable to the com-
pany and our stakeholders  is maintained and protected. This 
includes electronic data stored in our systems. All employees 
are responsible for complying with the relevant privacy and se-
curity policies, including the General Data Protection Regula-
tion. 
Whenever we receive requests to disclose or share potentially 
sensitive or confidential information, any disclosure must be 
both appropriate and legally necessary. We understand our ob-
ligation to protect the private data of our customers and suppli-
ers. All employees take great care to never jeopardise the 
security of that information.

4. Corporate Governance  
Exemplary corporate governance is essential to our sustainabil-
ity, fostering trust and nurturing lasting relationship with all our 
stakeholders, from suppliers to investors.  
As Photon Energy Group continues to grow, we are committed 
to maintaining and strengthening our focus on the responsible 
management of our operations and affairs at a corporate level.  
 
4.1 Corporate Governance Commitments 
 
► We have an independent supervisory board and au-
dit committee in place to provide guidance and 
oversight to the management board on the general 
affairs of the company. 
► As a listed company, we apply the Dutch Corporate 
Governance Code 2022 and Warsaw Stock Exchange 
Best Practices 2021. 
► We are committed to ensuring that all employees, 
customers, and suppliers act in an ethical manner 
and that stakeholders are n ot subject to unethical 
behaviours such as corruption, bribery or extortion.  
► We have an anti -corruption policy and a whistle-
blowing system in place, and an insider trading pol-
icy is signed by all employees when they sign their 
contract of employment.  
 
4.2 Governance Rules and Codes of Conduct 
Photon Energy N.V., the holding company for Photon Energy 
Group is publicly traded on regulated markets, which leads to 
heightened scrutiny of its governance practices and increases 
the importance of governance structures practices and behav-
iours. 
The listing of our shares on the main markets of the Warsaw 
and Prague stock exchanges also resulted in the adoption of the 
Dutch Corporate Governance Code 2022 as well as the Warsaw 
Stock Exchange Best Practices  2021, as guidelines for our cor-
porate governance. 
Companies in the renewables sector ha ve the potential to de-
velop close relationships with government officials, as well as 
with suppliers, third -party contractors, and utility customers. 
Any one of these relationships can be exploited by employees 
for financial gain. The utilities sector generally has historically 
experienced a range of incidents related to ethical misconduct, 
including procurement fraud (e.g., bid-rigging, false invoices, or 
collusion with vendors) and bribery. Best practice s for utilities 
include strong anti-corruption policies and whistleblowing sys-
tems, as well as due diligence on third-party transactions. 
A Supervisory Board and an Audit Committee were established 
on 4 December 2020. These changes to the Group’s corporate 
structure were connected to the transfer of its share listings to 
the regulated market of the Warsaw Stock Exchange and the 
standard market of the Prague Stock Exchange, in order to be 
in full compliance with the laws and regulations imposed on 
public companies as well as the best practices of the regulated 
markets. 
The Supervisory Board is responsible for supervising and advis-
ing the Management Board. In exercising its role, the 
supervisory board follows applicable law, the Articles of Associ-
ation of the Company, Dutch and Polish Corporate Code of Con-
duct, Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board, and the 
Company’s interests. It is a separate body that operates inde-
pendently of the management board. 
Photon Energy Group’s  Audit Committee (and its chairman in 
particular) undertakes preparatory work for the Supervisory 
Board’s decision-making regarding the supervision of the integ-
rity and quality of the Company’s financial reporting and the ef-
fectiveness of its internal risk management and control 
systems. It maintains contact with external auditors and moni-
tors the Management Board in connection with the Company’s 
funding, tax policy and application of IT technology, especially 
with respect to cybersecurity.  
Both bodies are comprised of three members: Boguslawa 
Skowronski, Marek Skreta and Ariel Sergio Davidoff, appointed 
to a four-year term of office.  
The three members not only possess extensive experience as 
entrepreneurs and executives at international institutions, but 
also have an in -depth knowledge about Photon Energy Group 
and its end-markets.  The membership consists of two men and 
a woman.  
Supervisory Board 
As already mentioned in this report, t he Supervisory Board is 
responsible for supervising and advising the Management 
Board. In exercising its role, the Supervisory Board follows the 
applicable law, the Articles of Association of the Company, 
Dutch Corporate Code of Conduct, Rules of Procedure  of the 
Supervisory Board, and the Company’s interests. It is a separate 
100% of our Technology 
suppliers 
Subject to due diligence

body that operates independently of Photon Energy Group’s 
Management Board.  
In the financial year 2023, the Supervisory Board met six times 
and the Audit Committee met five times. The Supervisory Board 
also adopted one written resolutions. In the meetings, the Su-
pervisory Board discussed a wide range of topics:  
► Impact of the acquisition of Lerta and related challenges 
in the integration process into the Photon Energy 
Group.  
► Strategy and guidance for the year 2023 at the begin-
ning of the financial year and assessing the feasibility of 
the project pipeline development by the end of financial 
year 2024.  
► The developments and trends in energy market in EU 
and Australia , specifically in jurisdictions where the 
Company is active.  
► Financial results were discussed and analysed in quar-
terly basis, including results and margin of operational 
segments, maintaining liquidity and cashflow.  
► The operational, financial, and legal affairs have been 
analysed and stabilisation of the company’s finance de-
partment and dual role of CEO/CFO , which was per-
formed by CEO.  
► Development of Australian projects with Raygen tech-
nology, results of PFAS pilot project in cooperation with 
the Department of Defence in Australia and its exten-
sion, divestment of developed projects in Poland, devel-
opment, and construction of the portfolio in Romania.  
► Development of the Company share and Green Bond 
price, share buyback and bond buyback. 
► Necessary implementation of the legislative require-
ments under the EU CSRD Directive (EU Taxonomy), sus-
tainability reporting and cybersecurity were discussed.  
► The chairman of Audit Committee  revised the Com-
pany’s internal risk management, controlling, com pli-
ance ad internal audit procedures.  
In 2023, there were no transactions subject to a conflict of in-
terest with the members of the Board of Directors and mem-
bers of the Supervisory Board.  
Audit Committee 
In 2022, the role of the head of the Audit Committee was as-
sumed by Mr. Davidoff who was elected by the general meeting 
held on 31 May 2022. In the course of 2023, the Audit Commit-
tee met five times and three times with external auditor, tacked 
the following topics: 
► The head of the Audit Committee, visited the headquar-
ter and operation in the Czech Republic,  conducted in-
terviews with senior personnel and engaged in 
preparatory work for the Supervisory Board’s meetings. 
He was instrumental in the engagement of a new Com-
pany CFO. 
► The audit plan and the outcome of the audit with the 
external auditors. 
► The Audit Committee performed a through and contin-
ues review of the internal risk management systems, in-
ternal audit function, controlling and legal compliance 
policies during the site visit in May, June, and September 
and throughout the 2023, year. The processes included 
the existing process in place, human resources, its com-
petencies.  
Further information on our corporate governance can be found 
in our 2023 Annual Report, as well as in the Corporate Govern-
ance section of our Investor Relations website. 
 
4.3 Risk Assessment and Management Due to Climate Change 
Climate change represents both strategic and operational risks 
to our business. These can be grouped as physical risks and 
transitional risks. Physical risks include greater severity of flood-
ing, droughts or other extreme weather events which could dis-
rupt our operations and supply chain. Transitional risks range 
from regulatory frameworks and the rising price of carbon to 
the viability and customer acceptance of emerging technolo-
gies. Another transitional risk is our ability to set and meet 
Paris-aligned targets.  
Risk of Natural Disasters  
The Group’s business could be materially and adversely af-
fected by natural disasters or other catastrophes, such as earth-
quakes, fires, floods, hail, windstorms, severe weather 
conditions or environmental accidents, which could potentially 
cause power loss, communication failures, explosions, or simi-
lar events. As a result of any damages to our facilities, the Group 
could have to temporarily suspend part or all of our facilities’ 
operations. Furthermore, authorities could impose restrictions 
on transportation and implement other preventive measures in 
affected regions to deal with a catastrophe or emergency, 
which could lead to the temporary closure of our facilities and 
declining economic activity at large. Moreover, if a natural dis-
aster results in the damage of any of our PV power plants, the 
Group’s ability to fulfil our liabilities may be considerably im-
paired, particularly if the damage is not covered by insurance. 
Assets in each geographic area are closely assessed both for the 
perils such as FLEXA (fire, lightning, explosion, aircraft) damage, 
other natural perils (flood, earthquake, windstorm, hail, snow 
etc.). All our assets are insured for all -risk cover both for prop-
erty damage and business interruption, including the machin-
ery & electronic breakdown. Indemnity periods for business 
interruption are selected based on the long-term experience 
and the brokers recommendations for the respective geo-
graphic area.  
All of the aforementioned circumstances would have a signifi-
cantly adverse effect on the Group’s financial situation, status , 
and results. The Group assesses the probability of risk as low, 
with low potential impact on our operations and financial re-
sults thanks to the geographic diversification of the Group’s 
business.

Meteorological Risk 
The performance and therefore the earning potential of the 
companies within the Group are often dependent upon mete-
orological conditions. Certain revenues for a generated kWh of 
energy are admittedly guaranteed on the basis of the state sub-
sidy programs; h owever, the volume of energy generated de-
pends on the period of sunshine and the sun’s radiance. Our 
subsidiaries have used certain historically based assumptions 
in cash flow planning. However, it is possible that climate con-
ditions could change in the future and that predictions regard-
ing weather patterns and hours of sunshine could prove 
incorrect. In cases such as these, electricity generation at PV 
power plants would be below the expected level, adversely af-
fecting the installation’s liquidity and the asset, financial and 
earnings positions of the respective project companies and on 
the Group as a whole.  
The earnings from PV power plants are subject to seasonal fluc-
tuations in the weather. As such, earnings are higher in the 
summer months and fall off significantly in winter. The compa-
nies within the Group try to adapt their payment obligations, 
especially with regard to interest and loans, to incoming pay-
ments. However, it cannot be ruled out that such adaptations 
may not always be possible, which could result in an adverse 
effect on the asset, financial and earnings position of the Group. 
With the realisa tion of investment projects in Australia, the 
overall financial liquidity of the Group will become less seasonal 
due to the diversification of locations in the northern and south-
ern hemispheres. 
The Group assesses the probability of risk as low, with low po-
tential impact on the Group’s operations and financial results. 
Environmental Risk 
In environmental matters, the Group must comply with laws, 
regulations, and directives valid in the location of each PV 
power plant; these laws regulate such things as airborne emis-
sions, sewage, the protection of soil and groundwater as well as 
health and safety. Transgressions against these environmental 
provisions can be pursued according to civil, criminal, and pub-
lic law. In particular, temporary provisions could encourage a 
third party to begin a legal process or to demand costly 
measures to control and remove environmental pollution or to 
upgrade technical facilities. The properties necessary for PV 
power plants are partially owned by the respective SPV. It can-
not be ruled out that sites may be contaminated. The respective 
SPV is responsible for the r emoval of any pollution, regardless 
of the cause. This could result in liability risks and costs related 
to administrative orders or requirements. 
All of these circumstances could have a negative impact on the 
financial situation, status and results of the Group. The Group 
assesses the probability of risk as low, with low potential impact 
on the Group’s operations and financial results. 
Based on the latest environmental assessment and the internal 
audit we find the environmental impact from all our operations 
very low.  
Climate Governance 
At Photon Energy Group, sustainability is a core value, viewed 
as central to the continual growth and success of any business. 
As such, we are dedicated to an increasing focus on sustainabil-
ity and the development of strong ESG practices. In adopting a 
strategic approach to sustainability, the Group addresses ma-
terial external risks, to become more resilient and adaptable in 
the face of challenges such as climate change and creating a 
space for new ideas and creative responses. In 2020, we laid the 
foundations for strategic management, controlling and report-
ing practices that are fully geared toward sustainability. A sus-
tainability department was created to work closely with the 
board of directors an d representatives from several business 
units within the Company. The objective of the department is to 
monitor the strategic coordination of the Company’s sustaina-
bility plans. 
 
 
4.4 Financial and Business Records 
Our books and records are prepared in regulatory detail and 
accurately reflect our transactions. All financial information is 
registered and reproduced in accordance with generally ac-
cepted accounting principles, with a system of internal account-
ing controls assuring that transactions are executed in 
compliance with manageme nt’s authorisation: a controlling 
mechanism is used to facilitate delegation  levels of authority 
and increase transparency with the four-eyes principles applied 
to every transaction. 
Any accounting information is registered in accordance with ap-
plicable laws and relevant accounting standards . From the fi-
nancial years 2013 to 2019 our Management Board appointed 
Grant Thornton Accountants en Adviseurs B.V. to serve as the 
auditor for Photon Energy N.V. and the group with its subsidiar-
ies. The appointments were confirmed by the general meetings 
of Photon Energy N.V. The auditor's report s were part of our 
annual reports, which are available on our website. 
Starting from the financial year 2020, the Management Board 
appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V. to serve 
as the auditor for Photon Energy N.V. and the group with its 
subsidiaries. The appointment was confirmed by the Extraordi-
nary General Meeting of Photon Energy N.V. held on 4 Decem-
ber 2020.  PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V. also 
performed the audit of the Group’s financial statements for the 
financial years 2021, 2022 and 2023.  
Tax Governance Control and Risk Management.  
Local accounting departments in all countries of operation have 
been established  to provide  more resilience as operations 
grow. Taxation is looked at locally with local advisors, with a po-
sition opened in 2024 for an international tax manager.  
From a financial point of view, the Company has a four-eye prin-
ciple to cross-check operations. For example, we have split com-
pliance and legal functions in order to achieve better 
governance. This included the appointment of a risk manager 
to support internal audit functions.

4.5 Anti-corruption
Our reputation for integrity is critically important, and we are  
committed to ensuring that all employees, customers and sup-
pliers act in an ethical manner and ensure that stakeholders are 
not the subject of unethical behaviours such as corruption, 
bribery, extortion or insider trading. We believe in free compe-
tition and will compete fairly, through honest business prac-
tices.  
Corruption erodes trust, weakens democracy, hampers eco-
nomic development, and further exacerbates inequality, pov-
erty, social division and environmental degradation. Photon 
Energy Group has never been the subject of any controversies, 
illustrating our ability to manage our relations with stakehold-
ers.  
Anti-corruption and Anti-bribery Policy 
As previously reinforced, renewable energy companies may 
have close ties with government officials, as well as relation-
ships with suppliers, third-party contractors and utility custom-
ers, and these  relationships could be exploited for financial 
gain. We have recently implemented an anti -corruption and 
anti-bribery policy within the company and have introduced a 
whistleblowing system and an ad-hoc disciplinary committee, 
composed representatives from our  HR and Legal depart-
ments, a member of the Board and a compliance officer. This 
committee will be assembled to discuss any breaches of our 
anti-corruption and anti-bribery policy and decide on the nec-
essary course of action. 
The Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy was updated in February 
2022 to include rules on providing and receiving gifts, as well as 
reporting violations in accordance with the rules of the Photon 
Energy Group Misconduct Reporting Policy described below.  
In March 2022, training sessions were conducted and adapted 
for all our subsidiaries in their local languages related to anti -
corruption and anti-bribery.  
Misconduct Reporting Policy and SpeakUp Line 
In line with current regulations as well as our own values and 
expectations, we have developed a Misconduct reporting policy 
and instituted the Photon Energy Group SpeakUp Line, a chan-
nel for employees, consultants, suppliers, and stakeholders to 
report misconduct related to our business and operations. 
This includes activities which could be interpreted or perceived 
as:  
► illicit or illegal 
► in contradiction with the values and principles de-
scribed in our Code of Ethics and other internal policies 
► harmful to Photon Energy Group, our employees or 
contractors, or our reputation as an entrepreneur, com-
petitor and employer  
This whistleblowing channel is available through internal chan-
nels and our corporate website. The system is encrypted and 
administered by an independent third -party service provider. 
All whistleblowers have the option to remain anonymous.  For 
employees, the SpeakUp Line is a means to report concerns 
through a secure, confidential channel in cases where they may 
be uncomfortable going through their line manager . As of this 
report’s publication, no incidents have been reported through 
the SpeakUp Line.  
Insider Trading Policy 
An insider trading policy is signed by all employees along with 
their contract of employment. This policy was developed to 
make sure employees understand their obligations to preserve 
the confidentiality of undisclosed information and to protect 
them and the company against legal liability. Employees who 
have permanent access to confidential information are subject 
to trading restriction periods and to trading notifications. They 
are reminded of their obligations on a quarterly basis. 
Legal Actions for Anti-competitive Behaviour, Anti-trust, 
and Monopoly Practices 
In the reporting year 202 3, there were no legal actions due to 
anticompetitive behaviour or violations of antitrust and monop-
oly law in which Photon Energy Group was an involved party. 
No political contributions neither cash nor non -cash contribu-
tions were made. 
 
4.6 Responsible Procurement 
Keen to engage in l ong-term relationships with our stakehold-
ers, we are careful in our selection of suppliers and subcontrac-
tors, seeking responsible partners who comply with our 
exacting standards for responsible procurement. 
We have in place both a Code of Ethics and a Procurement Pol-
icy, as well as a strengthened due diligence process . The Pro-
curement Policy provides detailed guidelines for the selection 
of suppliers, and our Third-Party conduct principles were inte-
grated to our newly concluded contracts.  
Code of Ethics 
The Code of Ethics contains a section with specific rules of con-
duct for purchasing and procurement. According to this, pur-
chasing decisions must be strictly aligned with Photon Energy 
Group’s interests, which exclusively concern objective criteria 
such as anti-corruption, quality, price, production requirements 
and logistics. Employees involved with procurement are explic-
itly banned from seeking personal benefits in return for prefer-
ential treatment, with the acceptance of gifts and event 
invitations also restricted to an absolute minimum. 
We have ensured that any of our individual suppliers have in-
fringed upon human rights, in particular the right to freedom of 
association or collective bargaining, nor the ban on child and 
forced labour. If we become aware of violations of the ban on 
child and forced labour in accordance with International Labour 
Organisation (ILO) conventions, or the enforcement of statutory 
minimum health and safety standards through audits or notifi-
cations, this will lead us to halt all business with the supplier 
concerned.

Our Code of Ethics was  updated in February 2022 to integrate 
principles regarding the prohibition of gender -based violence 
and harassment (GBVH). A training course  on Code of Ethics  
was developed for all of our employees in 2022.  
Due Diligence for Our Supply Chain 
We created a Third-party Code of Conduct setting clear expec-
tations for our technology suppliers with regards to ethics, hu-
man rights principles , h ealth and safety, and environmental 
issues. The document has been integrated to our concluded  
contracts starting in 2022. 
In 2023, we undertook a comprehensive revision of our Third -
Party Conduct Principles to strengthen our dedication to 
responsible procurement practices and to enhance human 
rights due diligence throughout our supply chain. This revision 
reflects our unwavering commitment to upholding the highest 
ethical standards and ensuring that our business operations 
align with our core values of integrity, community, sustainabil-
ity, and respect for human rights. By enhancing our principles, 
we aim to foster transparency , accountability, and sustainable 
business practices across all levels of our supply chain, thereby 
contributing to the well-being of workers and communities. 
We are not aware of any violations of our procurement princi-
ples in 2023. 
 
4.7 Donations 
Donation Policy 
In order to define a relevant and structured scope of action 
related to charities, donations and sponsorships, a Donation 
Policy has been created . This policy has the following objec-
tives:  
► providing guidelines around donations 
► supporting initiatives consistent with one another  
► better delivering on our commitment to support or-
ganisations whose vision and values align with our 
own.  
We believe that through donations  and CSR Days  we could 
have both social and environmental benefits. It allows us to as-
sist some of the most vulnerable members of our local com-
munities.  
Run for Good Causes 
Our team in Australia participated in a charity run, the Sydney 
City2Surf, which is the largest of its type in the world with over 
70,000 participants. The Company sponsored our team's entry 
costs, supporting multiple mental health charities and others. 
More than a third of the Sydney office took part in the 14km 
run. 
 
4.8 ESG Standards 
Since one of our goals is to continually improve the quality of 
the services we provide, we are committed to working accord-
ing to internationally recogni sed standards. This Sustainability 
Report has been prepared in accordance with GRI Standards. 
The content index presented in the Annex aims to provide our 
partners with references to appropriate sections in the body of 
the report. This content index has not been reviewed by a third 
party, nor by the GRI Material Disclosure Service. This is an im-
portant step to prepare the company for the compliance with 
the soon-to-be-released European Sustainability Reporting 
standard (ESRS). 
An environmental management system is in place, which takes 
into consideration  environmental and climate protection as 
well as maintaining an active dialogue with key stakeholders to 
identify the environmental risks and impacts of our work. 
Although we have successfully met these ISO standards, we will 
continuously improve and develop our ESG principles and poli-
cies in order to remain a reliable partner for our customers. We 
are planning to obtain ISO certification for all our relevant cor-
porate entities. 
For projects which may be developed in emerging countries in 
the future, we intend to perform stakeholder and engagement 
analyses in accordance with the International Finance Corpora-
tion’s performance standards. The se standards address and 
mitigate negative local impacts by developing and implement-
ing resettlement and livelihood restoration plans and require 
the establishment of long-term monitoring mechanisms.  
Our priority is to redesign our internal policies to achieve the 
best and most efficient integrated management system by uti-
lising quality, workplace health and safety, and environment as 
performance objectives. A team of managers has now been as-
signed to regularly review our internal procedures to ensure 
they are compliant and effective, and to measure sustainability 
actions to adjust our goals as necessary.

5. Green Financing Report 
Photon Energy N.V. issued its first green bond in November 
2021, in line with the Green Bond Principles 2021. 
This Green Financing Report was prepared to enable bondhold-
ers and other stakeholders to follow the development of the as-
sets and projects funded by the proceeds from our 2021/2027 
Green EUR Bond, which was issued and placed according to the 
following schedule: 
► On 17 November 2021, we successfully placed our first 
EUR 50 million of 6.50% Green EUR Bond 2021/2027 
(ISIN: DE000A3KWKY4), hereinafter referred as the 
“Green EUR Bond”. 
► On 24 November 2021 based on the Management 
Board resolution the Green EUR Bond was tapped by 
EUR 5 million to a total of up to EUR 55 million. 
► On 25 May 2022, the Company successfully tapped the 
Green EUR Bond by additional EUR 10 million. 
► On 1 September 2022 the Management Board resolved 
to tap the Green EUR Bond by an exchange offer to 
bondholders of the existing 2017/2022 corporate bonds 
and a public offer with subsequent private placement in 
the aggregate principal amount of up to EUR 25 million. 
As a result of this offer, including the exchange offer the 
Company increased the total outstanding amount of 
Green EUR Bond to EUR 77.5 million.  
► In March 2023, the Green EUR Bond was tapped by ad-
ditional EUR 2.5 million to EUR 80.0 million.   
► In the course of Q3 2023, the Company repurchased on 
the market the nominal value of EUR 0.615 million of its 
EUR Green Bond. 
Our Green Financing Framework has obtained a second party 
opinion from imug rating, an independent institution in Ger-
many, confirming that the framework for the Green EUR Bond 
is in line with the Green Bond Principles 2021.  
This Green Financing Framework provides the basis of all allo-
cations and impact reporting in this Green Financing Report to 
enable investors, bondholders and other stakeholders to follow 
the development of the assets and projects funded by our 
Green EUR Bond. 
The Green EUR Bond was the first green bond issued by Photon 
Energy N.V. and was confirmed by imug rating with regards to

5.1 Use of Proceeds from Our Green Bond  
An amount equivalent to the net proceeds from our Green EUR 
Bond have been used to finance or refinance, in part or in full, 
projects or assets providing distinct environmental benefits or 
financial instruments that were used to finance such projects 
or assets (‘Green Eligible Projects’).  
Green Eligible Projects are more specifically defined as invest-
ments in renewable energy sources. This also includes the de-
velopment and acquisition of such projects as well as 
investments in share capital of companies with such assets, 
where Photon Energy Group has significant operational influ-
ence and where the use of proceeds should be directly linked 
to the book value of the Green Eligible Projects owned by the 
acquired company, adjusted for the share of equity acquired. 
Our Green EUR Bond provides funds for investment activities 
and related expenditures, directed towards the acquisition, 
development and/or construction of facilities that produce 
electricity from solar power or hybrid solutions, possibly com-
bined with energy storage. Only activities that comply with the 
criteria below will be deemed eligible.  
Net proceeds can be used for: 
► The financing of new Green Eligible Projects.  
► The refinancing of existing Green Eligible Projects or 
the refinancing of financial instruments that were used 
to finance such Green Eligible Projects.  
In 2023, Green Eligible Projects were mainly developed and 
built in Romania, Hungary and Australia. 
In 2023, the remaining net proceeds (not allocated in previous 
years and increased through an additional  placement) of our 
first Green EUR Bond were allocated in the following manner:  
► Projects in development, under construction and com-
missioned in Australia, Hungary, and Romania in a total 
of EUR 14.2 million.  
► Liquid assets of EUR 4.6 million.  
With our allocated Green EUR Bond proceeds, we support pro-
gress towards the Paris Agreement and aspire to have a trans-
formative impact on the UN Sustainable Development Goals: 
#7 on affordable and clean energy and #13 on climate action.

5.2 Impact Report 
The Impact Report discloses the environmental impact of the 
Green Eligible Projects financed under our Green Financing 
Framework.  
► Annual renewable energy generation (MWh), in to-
tal and compared to plans: for every project, an audit 
is conducted by an external party to determine what the 
output will be like on a monthly basis. Thanks to our in-
house monitoring system we are able to track the an-
nual renewable energy generation (MWh) compared to 
these audits. In our periodic reports, we disclose the ac-
tual energy generation of our  PV power plant commis-
sioned, including those PV power plants that represent 
the investments of proceeds from our 6.50% Green EUR 
Bond 2021/2027. 
► Capacity of renewable energy power plants con-
structed (MWh), in total and per renewable energy 
technology (solar power, concentrated solar): we are 
able to track this breakdown as we are building our pro-
jects in house. 
► Estimated annual greenhouse gas emissions 
avoided (tCO 2e): the CO 2e avoided connected to the 
green electricity generated by our proprietary portfolio 
are based on the  International Financial Institutions 
Technical Working Group on Greenhouse Gas Account-
ing (IFI TWG) 2022 report, which can be found here.   
► Energy storage and other energy solutions  – capac-
ity and technology of electricity storage installed 
(MWh): the capacity associated to projects will be pro-
vided by our project development teams, which are de-
termined based on individual project characteristics. 
These data are subject to evolution over the time, until 
the end of the construction process.
