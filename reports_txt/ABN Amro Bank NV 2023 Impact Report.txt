About this report
The purpose of this report is to show the impact of 
ABN AMRO’s activities on the bank’s main stakeholder 
groups: clients, employees and investors, as well as on 
broader society.
The Report is based on results from ABN AMRO’s 2023 
impact measurement and contains four sections: 
•
 R
esults (which outlines the main results from our 
2023 assessment)
•
 Anal
ysis (which provides further analysis in three key 
areas – mortgages, biodiversity and corporate 
lending by sector)
• Ho w we use impact thinking (which sets out 
how ABN AMRO uses results from its impact 
measurement as an input to management decisions)
•
 ABN 
AMRO Impact Statements (including the 
bank’s Integrated Profit & Loss Statement)
In addition, there is a Note on Methodology, which 
provides more detail on the methodology used to 
compile this report. Please note that this report should 
be read in conjunction with other ABN AMRO 
publications, including the bank’s 2023 Integrated 
Annual Report, available online at abnamro.com. 
Welcome to ABN AMRO Bank N.V.’s sixth annual Impact Report. 
The Impact Report and the underlying methodology 
(including the monetised impact values and the 
integrated profit and loss statement) should be seen as 
a publication that helps us to better understand the 
impact we make as a bank and which could support us 
in future CSRD compliance. This Impact Report is not 
intended to meet CSRD requirements that are 
applicable to the bank (as per 2024 Integrated Annual 
report), as the goal of the Impact Report is different. 
The methodology, scope and definitions used in the 
Impact Report were designed for a different purpose 
than ESRS compliance and so are not fully aligned with 
the definitions used in ESRS, more detailed information 
on the differences can be found on page 38.  
This Impact Report should therefore be seen as a 
complementary view on the impact of the bank, next 
to the Integrated Annual Report, which is our main 
report for ESRS compliance in the future.

Welcome to our 
2023 Impact Report
This is ABN AMRO’s sixth annual Impact Report. Our 
reporting has grown in importance and sophistication 
– we have become better at measuring the impact of 
our activities. Over the past six years, I am proud of 
what we have been able to achieve.
Understanding impacts is important – first, because it 
gives us better insight in the effects we have on our 
stakeholders. By understanding the positive and negative 
effects, we can work to reduce the negative ones – and 
we do, through our approach to risk management and 
by working closely with clients and partners.
It also helps us to identify opportunities – and to seize 
these opportunities by directing more attention to areas 
where we know we have a positive impact, particularly 
through our loans and investment services, or where 
we can reduce the risks by seizing the opportunities.
Because we realise the importance of understanding 
impact, we have been working hard to embed Impact 
Thinking throughout our organisation.
In the recent years we made many impact reports 
which helped us to assess the high-level sustainability 
consequences of our loan portfolio. To make it more 
concrete for our clients we needed to dig deeper and 
to understand the consequences per sector.
We are using Impact Thinking increasingly with our 
Social Impact Fund to make investment decisions – we 
have found that it provides valuable insights for us as 
investors and for the companies in which we are 
investing, to help them build and grow their businesses.
In recent years, we have seen regulators take more 
interest in key information beyond the traditional P&L. It 
is the recognition of the (positive) role banks play in 
society, but also of the new risks banks face, especially 
as a result of worsening climate change. Our 
experience in measuring and reporting also helped us 
to respond quickly to new regulatory requirements.
We realise that impact is not just about a series of 
numbers. Thinking and managing in terms of impact is 
about a cultural shift. It is about Impact Thinking – in 
other words, making sure we take impact into account 
when making our decisions: impact on the bank, of 
course, but also through our clients and the impact on 
those who depend on us. Ultimately, Impact Thinking 
will make the bank stronger.
And in making the bank stronger, we will be better able 
to manage risk, better able to seize opportunities for 
growth, better able to support and protect our clients 
and contribute to a fairer, more sustainable society in 
line with our purpose: Banking for better, for 
generations to come.
Robert Swaak 
CEO of ABN AMRO
“ Ultimately, Impact Thinking  
will
 make the bank stronger”
“Because we realise its importance, we have been working hard  
to embed impact throughout our organisation.”

Methodology and approach
Our 2023 assessment
Our activities often have a significant impact on 
stakeholders – not just our clients and those working 
for the bank, but also on our shareholders and 
investors, on suppliers to the bank and other business 
partners, as well as on broader society. 
We realise that this impact may be positive or negative. 
By providing mortgages, for example, we are offering 
borrowers the benefits of home ownership. But by 
having to repay mortgage loans, some clients may 
experience financial distress. 
Similarly, by lending to companies, we may add to 
economic growth and job creation but could also 
contribute to climate change or biodiversity loss. 
Input to and complementing European 
sustainability reporting standards
The Impact Report’s measurement approach draws 
from impact methodologies such as the Impact-
Weighted Accounts Framework (IWAF), the basis of 
which was established in 2019. We use external data 
sources such as social and environmental databases, 
government data and academic literature to estimate 
the impact of the bank. As such, the results presented 
1 See page 44 for how we define our stakeholders.
in this report are used as one of several inputs to the 
double materiality assessment as part of European 
Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). For more 
information on how this has been used please  
see page 7. 
The two frameworks partly overlap in their underlying 
concepts however there are several key differences, 
such as the topics in scope and methodological 
features used in the Impact Reporting methodology 
such as monetisation and attribution (see page 38 in 
the Annex for further details). 
CSRD and the Impact Report methodology 
complement each other. CSRD will unlock a wealth of 
data on environmental and social topics. In the future 
the impact methodology can serve as a tool to leverage 
this data for decision making. For example, the impact 
methodology can be used by the bank to support 
Sector bankers in specific sectors to measure client 
impact across topics and provide support in managing 
this impact.
Using Impact Thinking in  
our decision-making 
Integrating impact thinking in our decision-making 
allows us to identify potential risks and opportunities, 
both for ourselves and our stakeholders1. Since we 
launched our first Impact Report in 2018, interest in 
Impact Thinking has grown, both within ABN AMRO 
and the banking sector.
While managing risks, assessing impact helps us 
identify potential social and environmental risks. 
Identifying these risks means we can take action, 
deliver on our sustainability ambitions, avoid financial 
losses, or damage to our reputation, as well as 
protecting our clients. For example, we look at the 
potential contribution to the loss of biodiversity, 
including which sectors and business lines have the 
biggest footprint and explore what we can do to 
contribute to solutions.
Assessing impact is also helping ABN AMRO meet new 
regulatory requirements. Regulators are beginning to 
put more emphasis on companies’ social and 
environmental disclosures. 
ABN AMRO is one of the Netherlands’ leading banks. We provide  
loans and other financial services to individuals and businesses, both  
in the Netherlands and elsewhere in north-west Europe.

Our impact statements
Methodology and approach
As of 2024, CSRD and ESRS require companies – 
including ABN AMRO – to disclose material Impacts, 
Risks and Opportunities.
We are using impact measurement to support the 
impact investing portfolio of our Sustainable Impact 
Fund (SIF). SIF makes direct investments in companies 
and projects involved in the energy transition, in the 
circular economy, and in social areas like inclusion and 
health & wellbeing. 
Finally, we are continuously working on improving the 
granularity and coverage of our impact data client 
level. This will help us, and our banking clients make 
more tailored decisions specific to their circumstances. 
This year we started a case study in the textile sector to 
look what it takes to further implement our Impact 
methodology on sector level. Currently such detailed 
data is difficult to come by, but we expect that to 
change as new reporting regulations come into effect. 
You can read more about our approach to Impact 
Thinking on pages 20-25.
Support for our double materiality assessment
During the past year, we started using impact 
data in our new double materiality assessment. 
An important data source for our Impact data was 
the Impact Institute’s Global Impact Database. 
This data proved useful not only in helping 
identify impacts, but also in linking these impacts 
to the ESRS – the reporting standards underpinning 
the EU’s new Corporate Sustainability Reporting 
Directive (CSRD). Double materiality assessments 
became mandatory with the CSRD’s introduction 
at the beginning of 2024.1 
  
For more information, see our 2023 Annual 
Integrated Report, available online.
1  These assessments measure materiality from two perspectives: 
impact materiality – i.e., issues that impact people and the environment 
and financial materiality – i.e., matters that effect the company’s 
development, financial position, financial performance, cash flows, 
access to finance or cost of capital over the short-, medium- or 
long

Methodology and approach
How to read our Impact Statements
Our assessment examines impact through two lenses: first, who is impacted? Second, what kind of impact is it?
This assessment is based on a series of 57 impacts, ranging from the benefits of home ownership and health & 
safety in the workplace through to the effects of cybercrime and use of natural resources. 
Each impact is measured and assigned a euro-equivalent value; this allows us to compile an Integrated  
Profit & Loss Statement (IP&L). Impacts are shown by stakeholder group (who is impacted?) and by ‘capital’ 
(what kind of impact is it?).1 
A dashboard summary of our IP&L may be found on page 9. 
This approach also allows us to identify external costs – i.e., those costs that are not currently priced into the 
bank’s transactions, such as environmental pollution or harm to labour and human rights. More than 90% of 
these costs occur downstream, primarily as a result of ABN AMRO’s lending and investment activities. It is 
important to note that impacts in the value chain of ABN AMRO are estimated based on external data sources 
and models. At this point, primary data on the actual impact created by clients and investees (and their value 
chains) is not readily available.
We appreciate that measuring value creation is not an exact science. We work hard every year to strengthen 
our approach and methodology. Currently, we use euro-equivalent ranges to show impact rather than 
specific amounts. 
For this report, we are comparing our 2023 results with 2022 figures restated to reflect changes in our 
database and to incorporate new data.

Methodology and approach
ABN AMRO provides financial services that benefit different 
stakeholders, but at the same time, this is also expected to result in 
negative impact, mostly for society. This dashboard shows how we 
create value for stakeholders by capital:
Clients Employees Investors Society
2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022
Commercial
Includes value of housing and other banking 
and investment services, fees, commissions and 
other income, as well as payments to suppliers, 
employees and investors, the value of data 
protection and other bank systems and processes 
Human
Includes employees’ and contractors’ time, 
skills and productivity, health & safety, and 
the well-being effects of employment
Social
Includes customer loyalty and our impact on social 
issues, particularly downstream, such as child 
labour, underpayment, and financial distress 
experienced by clients unable to repay mortgages 
or other loans
 
Natural
Includes use of natural resources, as well as 
contribution to climate change and environmental 
pollution
Human capital 
for investors has 
increased driven by 
higher profits by the 
bank. This leads to 
a high return on 
human capital for 
investors.
The chart above shows impact by affected stakeholder group and type or capital 
(commercial, human, social and natural); these capitals are taken from the Integrated 
Reporting <IR> framework. Commercial is a combination of the <IR> Framework’s 
manufactured, financial and intellectual capitals. All impacts are shown in euro-equivalent 
ranges. In the chart above, we have highlighted the main changes compared with 2022.
Who are ‘Society’?
Society is one of our most 
important stakeholder groups. 
It includes suppliers, 
governments and all people 
and businesses working in our 
clients’ supply chains.

Our impact statements
Methodology and approach
We did not see significant year-on-year 
changes in our impact
Results from our 2023 assessment do not differ greatly 
from our 2022 results. This is due mainly to the fact that 
there were no significant changes in our operations or 
business portfolio since the wind-down of our former 
non-core portfolio, started in 2021. Results were 
influenced by changes in economic conditions, most 
notably higher interest rates but these were not 
significant enough to be visible in our dashboard 
summary.
We continued to create positive 
commercial value for all stakeholders
As in previous years, we continued to create value in 
terms of commercial capital for all our stakeholders, 
through our reliable financial products and services, 
salaries and benefits paid to employees, and dividends 
for investors. During 2023, higher interest rates created 
value for investors, largely through increased net 
interest income for the bank. Society continued to 
benefit from the bank’s digital payment systems and 
tax contributions. 
A significant amount of negative impact 
still occurs in our value chains
Our 2023 results also show estimated negative 
impacts, occurring primarily downstream at our clients 
or within their supply chains. Because they are our 
clients, we are partly associated with their impacts. 
These impacts relate to social and environmental issues 
such as climate change, low pay and human rights 
violations. 
These costs are borne mostly by society, we aim to 
reduce them where possible by upholding minimum 
standards in our loans and investment services. 
Through our Climate Strategy, we will also bring our 
lending and investment portfolios into line with targets 
set out in the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.

Impact Summary
We create significant positive commercial value for all stakeholders but this still comes at  
a cost for people and the planet. In the figure, spheres represent euro-equivalent impact ranges.  
See page 27 for impact range information. 
In this figure we focus on commercial capital and external costs for employees and society. These external costs are mostly social and natural capital effects. 
For this reason not all stakeholder and capital groups are included in this visual.

External costs within our value chain
There are unintended external costs resulting from our 
activities. These are costs not currently priced into the 
bank’s transactions, such as the cost of environmental 
pollution or infringement of labour rights. Most are 
incurred downstream through our lending and asset 
management. 
As a matter of policy, we do not finance activities linked 
to tobacco, tar sands, oil & gas exploration in the Arctic, 
new thermal coal plants or companies involved in 
human rights abuses or widespread deforestation. 
Findings from our 2023 assessment 
Results from our assessment showed that most 
external costs were estimated to be similar to those 
in 2022. 
Among the leading external costs were estimated to be 
again downstream contributions to air pollution, 
climate change, underpayment, risk of money 
laundering, use of scarce materials and 
gender inequality. 
The chart below shows external costs in 2023 by both 
stakeholder group and capital; it also identifies where 
in our value chain these costs occur:

Mortgages and the housing market
Our largest portfolio
We are one of the Netherlands’ leading mortgage 
lenders. We create value through home ownership, but 
recognize that our mortgages also have adverse 
effects: through for example increased climate change 
from energy use and stress among clients who may 
face difficulties repaying their loans.
How we are minimising the  
negative impacts
• W e have included residential mortgages as a target 
sector in our Climate Strategy, aiming to reduce 
carbon intensity by 34% by 2030 compared to 2021.
•
 With our
 expertise we will help homeowners and 
buyers increase their homes’ energy performance 
outlining costs, subsidies and potential savings 
associated with energy efficiency measures.
•
 In
flation and rising energy costs increase financial 
pressures on homeowners, for some, increasing 
the difficulty to repay loans. To relieve financial 
difficulty for clients we offer budget coaching 
and debt counseling. We do not offer this service 
exclusively to mortgage clients, but also to other 
clients in personal banking.
Clients pay interest for mortgages and get, in return, a 
mortgage loan. In addition, they experience the following 
effects: 
  Clien t value through home ownership: Clients also benefit 
financially from home ownership as opposed to renting. 
Renting is generally more expensive than buying a house in 
the Netherlands. With rising interest rates on mortgage loans 
in 2023, costs for mortgage holders have increased, reducing 
the financial benefit from home ownership slightly (impact 
indicator 25).
  Clien t value through change in house value: They may also 
experience a change in the value of their property – between 
2022 and 2023 house prices in the Netherlands have been 
declining, which results in a negative impact for home-owners 
(impact indicator 2).
  Social bene fits of homeownership: There are other social 
benefits from owning your own home – increased life 
satisfaction, for example (impact indicator 49). 
  Financial distr ess due to difficulties in repaying mortgages: 
Some clients experience distress if unable to repay their 
mortgages (impact indicator 48). 
  Impact on na ture: Houses also cause environmental damage, 
contributing to air pollution, climate change and consumption 
of scarce natural resources. Less construction of new housing 
reduced emissions and material use in 2023. Overall, this 
leads to a small decrease in climate change, air pollution and 
energy use impacts associated with our mortgage portfolio 
(impact indicators 51-53).

Banks as stewards of capital can advance 
sustainable change
Banks play an important role in combating climate 
change through their ability to allocate capital. 
In this Sector Analysis we only focus on the negative 
impacts of the portfolio, to create more insights 
where improvements are possible. A large part of 
our impact arises from our corporate lending services. 
Tackling and reducing this impact is an important 
step in supporting the fight against climate change, 
biodiversity loss and other environmental and 
social issues. 
Understanding our impact
Through our corporate lending portfolio, we facilitate 
companies in their growth, leading to positive 
commercial capital impacts but also negative 
environmental and social impacts such as air 
pollutants, scarce material, and land use, as well as 
underpayment.
In 2023, a total negative impact of €280 million was 
estimated to be indirectly generated through our 
corporate lending portfolio. We have identified that this 
effect is mainly determined by the following five 
drivers: air pollution, climate change, and to a lesser 
degree, use of scarce materials, land use, and 
underpayment. Impact is mainly driven by transport 
and storage, as well as agriculture, forestry and fishing, 
which are also identified as priority sectors in our 
Climate Strategy.
In all sectors, air pollution is the biggest negative 
impact; this is in a large part due to nitrogen and 
particulate matter emissions which have detrimental 
health effects on humans. Contribution to climate 
change is also a major impact; this is in large part due 
to the remediation costs associated with preventing 
a changing climate. In general, environmental impact 
drivers cause more than 90% of all negative impacts 
in these sectors.
The impact of ABN AMRO’s corporate loan portfolio 
does not change significantly between years. Instead, 
we look at the relative magnitude of impacts and key 
drivers by sector alongside estimations of impact 
intensity. This provides actionable and steerable 
information for portfolio managers, sector bankers and 
other relevant stakeholders.

Methodology and approach
Impact breakdown in the top three sectors
Impact occurs throughout the value chains of clients. 
For example, a shipping company has direct impact 
through the operation of ships, it has upstream impact 
from the production of transported goods, and 
downstream impact from their use and disposal. 
A share of each value chain step is then attributed to 
ABN AMRO’s clients and then the bank itself. Knowing 
where this impact occurs across the portfolio can  
be a first step in engaging with clients to reduce  
their impact. For our most impactful sectors, this is 
distributed in different ways across the value chain.
The manufacturing sector includes the production of a wide range of 
products including metal products, food products as well as chemical 
and petroleum products. In this sector the majority of the impact is 
estimated in the value chain of our clients. Next to environmental issues 
such as air pollution and climate change, social issues are prevalent, 
including underpayment and gender inequality. These social and 
environmental effects are mainly linked to the extraction of resources for 
the production of goods such as mining and farming. Downstream of our 
manufacturing clients, impact arises from the transportation of materials 
and use of produced goods.
Environmental and social impact in our client’s value chain
Upstream Direct Downstream
Top three sectors Description
Manufacturing
Manufacturing companies, 
e.g. food producers, 
producers of wood, textile 
and metal products.
Producers of input for 
manufactured products  
e.g. mining companies,  
cotton farmers and  
forestry companies.
Transport and users of 
produced goods e.g. 
transport companies, use  
of products by businesses.
Agriculture, forestry, and fishing are also expected to account  
for a significant portion of our negative impact. The majority of this 
impact arises directly at our clients and is mainly linked to air pollution. 
Animal rearing and the use of fertilisers are important drivers of this 
environmental damage. In the value chain of our clients, the production 
of agricultural inputs, such as feed for animals as well as the 
manufacture of food products drive approximately 40% of total impact.
Agriculture, forestry  
and fishing
30% 35%
35%
Agricultural companies e.g. 
livestock farms and crop 
field farms.
Suppliers of agricultural 
inputs e.g. agrochemical and 
machinery companies, grain 
and soy used for animal feed.
Companies downstream  
of agricultural companies 
e.g. manufacturing of food 
products, transportation, 
and super markets.
Significant impact is esimated in the transport sector. A third of this 
impact occurs directly at our corporate lending clients and is mainly 
linked to air pollution. The shipping industry is, in particular, responsible 
for significant volumes of pollutants such as nitrogen and sulphur 
oxides. Two thirds of the impact of our clients occur upstream and 
downstream in their value chains. This is mainly linked to the 
production and use of transported goods, such as for example the 
growing of feed for agricultural production.

To avoid double counting between the impact of the sectors, we use attribution. For example, a transport company operates in the value chain of a manufacturer of goods 
as it transports produced goods. As a value chain partner, it also receives a share of the impact of production. This is a part of the methodology and emphasises the concept 
of shared association with impacts across the value chain. For further insight see the Note on methodology - As used in the Impact Report 2023.Figures in the graphs above have been rounded.

Impact on biodiversity
The biodiversity crisis
Scientists with the leading IPBES platform are warning that one million species of 
plants and animals worldwide are facing extinction1 – at a faster rate than ever before 
in human existence. A more recent estimate shows the figure may in fact be 
underestimated, as the number of insect species under threat appears to be closer to 
two million2. 
The loss of biodiversity could weaken the ability of ecosystems to provide ecosystem 
services. These include such things as crop pollination, carbon storage, water and air 
purification and protection against diseases. More than half of the global economy 
depends on these services to a medium or high degree, making this a long-term risk 
for the bank, our clients and society. Research by the European Central Bank shows 
that 75 percent of all eurozone bank loans are issued to companies with a high 
dependency on at least one ecosystem service3.
Biodiversity loss constitutes a highly important topic for ABN AMRO – we aim to 
minimise any unintended impact on biodiversity as a result of our activities.
What is the Impact?
Through our lending and wealth management, we provide capital to allow companies 
to grow. However, growth comes with higher resource use, which can contribute to 
further depletion of natural resources and put increased pressure on biodiversity. 
Previous analyses of our portfolio carried out together with Impact Institute show that 
the greatest damage inflicted on biodiversity by the bank – as a service provider – 
occurs through our clients4.
The main drivers of biodiversity loss we measure are: 
•
 Con
tribution to climate change from increased greenhouse gas emissions, often 
arising through sectors such as energy production or transportation
•
 Land use,
 often to accommodate agriculture
•
 Air
 pollution, arising from industrial production
•
 W
ater pollution, from for example, cattle farming5

these are also causers of biodiversity loss worth mentioning here.

How we use Impact Thinking
Our impact statements
Methodology and approach
These environmental pressures affect the health of ecosystems. This happens directly 
through habitat loss from land use or the emission of damaging pollutants. 
Biodiversity loss also occurs indirectly through for instance, pollutants that alter the 
ecological balance.
Our 2023 biodiversity results show that through our lending and wealth management 
activities, an estimated total deterioration of 30 thousand bio-hectares1 occurred. 
This is roughly equal to the size of Rotterdam.
Expressed in monetary terms, this loss amounts to an estimated EUR 105 million2. This 
represents the value of ecosystem services lost due to a reduction in species abundance 
and diversity, in a particular biome, in our case, mainly in the Netherlands. The vast 
majority of this impact comes from two key drivers, namely contribution to climate 
change and land use. Nearly 80% of the total impact comes from Dutch clients and 
suppliers, a reflection of the bank’s strategic focus on the Netherlands and Northwest 
Europe. We also have impact on biodiversity through clients in Greece, Belgium, the 
United Kingdom and Norway. The sector with the highest negative impact on biodiversity 
is agriculture, mainly through environmental pollution caused by nitrogen from manure 
as well as land use required for the production of crops and the rearing of cattle. In 
addition, the transport sector is associated with significant biodiversity loss. Shipping is 
responsible for a large share of emissions such as nitrogen oxide and sulphur dioxide.
What are we doing to minimize our negative impacts?
ABN AMRO can support nature most effectively by helping clients in their transition 
and therefore by minimizing their negative impact. This means, that we do not grant 
loans for activities on our Exclusion List, such as deep sea mining. We also discuss with 
our clients their impact on nature, for example with farmers to reduce their 
environmental impact, retailers to adopt more circular working practices, and food 
producers to limit their deforestation impact. 
We took further steps in 2023, for example by designing an action plan3 to integrate 
this topic more deeply into the heart of our operations. The plan will generate nature 
goals that are co-owned by various departments of the bank and relate to activities 
1 Bio-hectar es refer to the size of the pristine land cover in a particular biome, for example a bio-hectare in the Netherlands 
refers to a hectare of shrubland and grassland.

such as lending and investing. As well as reducing the negative impact of us and our 
clients on nature, with our plans we can help clients anticipate pending legislation. 
The plan also includes a targeted approach, focusing first on the agricultural sector, 
which we started working on in the fourth quarter of 2023. The approach is based on 
a vision for the medium term linked to a concrete action plan with goals for the 
coming years, which we work on further in 2024. The comparable approach will be 
applied to the built environment, starting in 2024.
Finally, we are mapping the impact, interdependencies and risks associated with the 
erosion of ecosystems. On the basis of the environmental risk heatmaps developed in 
2022, a broader analysis of the entire corporate loan book was conducted in 2023. 
The analysis weighs physical risks per sector (such as crop failures due to drought) 
and transition risks (such as major investment requirements to comply with rules 
and regulations).
Due to rounding, figures in this graph may not add to 100%.

Risk identification
We used impact data to identify risks in our climate, 
environmental and social risk heatmaps. These risk 
heatmaps identify potential climate, environmental and 
social risk hotspots in our corporate lending and 
residential real estate portfolios. 
Risk identification is based on the potential impact of 
sectors in which our clients operate (also known as the 
inherent potential risk). This is not the same as the 
actual impact made by our clients, which may be 
smaller as a result of the measures we take to mitigate 
adverse human rights risks. 
For the social risk heatmap, we only focused on the risk 
of adverse impact. The climate and environmental risk 
heatmaps identified the risks of adverse impacts, which 
we then combined with data on sector-relevant policy 
and technological developments to arrive at a measure 
of transition risk. You can find more information on this 
in the ABN AMRO Annual Report 2023. 
Risk measurement
In the area of risk measurement, we used impact data 
in our cross-sector environmental risk scenario analysis. 
In this analysis, we assumed that European water and 
air pollution and nature conservation regulations will 
be implemented and enforced strictly in the 
Netherlands over the coming seven years. 
Using sectoral environmental impact data from Impact 
Institute, Dutch Emission Registration, and geographic 
data from PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment 
Agency and the National Institute for Public Health and 
the Environment, we simulated the cost and business 
continuity risks for our clients. Costs were calculated by 
assuming the internalisation of external environmental 
costs of pollution and business continuity risk was 
calculated by assuming permit limitations for clients that 
are both in high impact sectors and operate in highly 
sensitive natural areas. You can find more information on 
this in the ABN AMRO Annual Report 2023.
Impact data informed our risk heatmaps which  
we use to enhance our strategic decision making.
In 2023 we used environmental and social impact data in several  
sustainability risk identification and measurement processes.

The true value  
of investing  
in transitions
Using the Impact measurement and valuation 
methodology, quantitative results demonstrate that 
through these investments, ABN AMRO Sustainable 
Impact Fund generates a 39% positive impact return. 
ABN AMRO Sustainable Impact Fund was launched in 
2021, with a commitment of EUR 500 million. It builds 
on the efforts and knowledge of preceding funds, the 
ABN AMRO Social Impact Fund and the ABN AMRO 
Energy Transition funds, and aims to help accelerate 
the transition towards a sustainable economy.
For us, impact investing is not a modern form of 
philanthropy or a feel-good activity. It is about 
transition: changing the world by changing the way we 
make money. It is about providing capital which allows 
for daring new business models, innovative 
technologies, the break-up of traditional value chains 
or the development of new market structures. We aim 
to realise a lasting positive and scalable impact for 
climate, people and planet, while at the same time 
making a profit. Examples of investments are 
electronics manufacturer Fairphone, sustainable 
detergent and soap brand Seepje, and the Danish 
sustainable fashion brand Colorful Standard.
Impact measurement and impact thinking has long 
been central to the strategy of ABN AMRO SIF. Prior to 
investment, portfolio companies undergo an Impact 
due diligence together with the traditional legal and 
commercial due diligence procedures. This includes 
a review of the companies potential to create and 
demonstrate positive impact as well as identifying 
potential negative impact risks. 
We use impact thinking to estimate the social  
and environmental impact of our investments.
ABN AMRO Sustainable Impact Fund (SIF) published their first Impact Report1  
in 2023, showcasing the impact results achieved over 2022 for all 14 companies 
in the portfolio.

Results from the SIF Impact Report
Impact of our Sustainable Impact Fund
Results show that the fund generates a 39% positive 
impact return. The Impact Return is the ratio of the sum 
of the impacts of the companies in 2022 over the total 
investments in these companies.
Our assessment shows that our fund contributes most 
to the energy and environmental transition through 
avoided greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution and 
scarce material use. In addition, society and employees 
have benefitted from job creation and fair wages 
through the activities of the companies in our portfolio. 
While our portfolio companies contribute to 
environmentally and socially sustainable solutions, 
their procurement and production processes have 
a negative impact on the environment through the 
contribution to climate change and air pollution.
Calculating the impact
Calculations are done using the Impact Weighted 
accounts framework (IWA framework). The IWA 
Framework is based on the same Impact methodology 
as this Impact Report. 
This methodology highlights the importance of 
not only considering financial performance, but 
considering environmental and social performance 
as well. This means that on top of a company’s usual 
financial costs or P&L, the climate, environmental 
and social costs are also taken into consideration. 
The negative impacts plus the financial costs are 
jointly called the true costs. This delivers transparency 
regarding where these true costs are, i.e., where 
impact has been made and where improvements 
are still possible.
All information in this article can also be found in  
this publication.

Impact Thinking throughout the bank
Measuring  
impact at client  
level
We are moving towards capturing 
impact on a client level, starting with 
a pilot on the textile sector.
ABN AMRO uses an impact methodology to 
continuously improve its insight into where it makes the 
greatest impact. Knowing this in terms of both sectors 
and clients enables us to open the conversation with 
clients that perform very well on certain topics but 
could improve on others. In this way, we want to give 
clients the opportunity to leverage impact information 
much more proactively, and to base investment choices 
not just on financial aspects but also their social impact.
Textile industry pilot 
The textile sector has already introduced various 
initiatives and tools to increase transparency and make 
production more sustainable. But identifying the 
relevant social and environmental indicators is not 
easy: the textile chain is complex, and impact is 
strongly affected by factors like the client’s business 
model, choice of materials and production location, 
and the large number of subcontractors involved. 
Information about the impact of textile production is 
certainly available at the level of individual clients, but in 
other parts of the chain it is often fragmented and long 
production chains (outside the EU) can make it very 
difficult for clients to get a clear picture of the situation. 
The textile sector makes use of certificates to provide 
insight into different topics and parts of the chain. 
Because these certificates tend to focus on specific 
social or environmental indicators rather than looking at 
the whole chain, the data provided does not fully match 
the broad scope of our impact methodology.
Increasing availability of client level data
In the coming years, legislation will be rolled out 
around the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive 
(CSRD), under which large companies will be required 
to report on sustainability-related topics. Although 
many of our clients in the textile sector are too small to 
be in scope for the CSRD, increasing supply of client 
data will be useful in impact assessments for other 
sectors. We are working to further develop our thinking 
and tools to incorporate client level data into our 
engagement with clients and portfolio management.
Moving towards integrating client level data  
will help us steer on impact.

distress is an important topic in the Netherlands as six 
in ten households sometimes have difficulties making 
ends meet. This is partly due to inflation and rising 
energy costs and can give rise to financial distress. 
Financial distress in private households in turn impacts 
society, for example by causing economic downturn or 
by putting additional pressure on the health care 
system. ABN AMRO’s Financial Health department is 
there to help clients facing these problems, making 
them financially resilient or preventing them from 
getting into debt. 
Proactive
There are many reasons why people may get into 
financial trouble, such as divorce, illness, job loss or 
outstanding student loans. Many clients facing money 
problems don’t raise the alarm until it is too late, with 
predictable consequences. That’s why we want to help 
our clients as early as possible. Our debt assistance 
advisers and budget coaches advise our clients about 
measures that boost income and help them gain 
overview of their incomes and expenditures. Clients 
can also get in touch with a savings coach through the 
ABN AMRO app and learn where they could save costs 
during a coaching session. 
The younger, the better
A survey carried out by Deloitte showed that 45 percent 
of young people aged 18 to 25 are financially unhealthy 
or vulnerable. Prevention and financial awareness are 
important: the younger people become aware, the 
better. We are therefore focusing on this target group, 
by giving guest lessons at schools and by offering the 
Gimi app, a fun way to teach children about money. 
These initiatives help the next generation build 
financial knowledge and skills. 
Banking is about people
Our Financial Health department offers support 
across all life phases. This aligns with our purpose: 
“Banking for better, for generations to come”. We are 
there for our clients every step of the way, in good 
times and in bad times. Our department helped 
21,000 unique clients this past year. In doing so, 
ABN AMRO is looking to contribute to a society 
in which everyone can take part, where equal 
opportunities and financial inclusion are the norm.
Our Financial Health department works 
towards reducing negative impact on clients.
Our Financial Health department is 
helping Personal Banking clients  
who are facing financial distress.

We report our impact in ranges – 
these ranges do not use a linear 
scale, so should not be added or 
multiplied.

AMRO’s Contribution to the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals
Each of these statements shows estimated impact in 
euro-equivalents by both stakeholder group and 
capital. More information on impact statements can be 
found on page 42 and in the Methodology section. All 
statements relate to ABN AMRO Bank N.V. and include 
both direct and indirect impacts. The IP&L Statement is 
our principal value creation statement; it provides an 
overview of the bank’s impact, including whether value 
has been created, lost or transferred. This Statement 
acts as the basis for the other statements.
All impacts are shown in ranges (see table opposite). 
Positive impact is shown in light green, negative in 
coral red. Where no lines are included, this is largely 
due to a lack of available data. For more information on 
our methodology and approach, see pages 36-45.

Methodology and approach
Our contribution to the 
UN Sustainable Development Goals
Through our activities, we contribute positively to the 
UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). There are 
seventeen SDGs in total. We support every goal, but 
there are three where we believe ABN AMRO has most 
to contribute as a provider of loans, banking and 
investment services: 
•
 SDG 8: Dec
ent work and economic growth
•
 SDG 1
2: Responsible production and consumption
•
 SDG 1
3: Climate action
For two of these – SDG 12 and SDG 13 – we are 
working to reduce the bank’s negative impact by 
collaborating closely with clients to reduce their 
contribution to climate change and to use natural 
resources and other materials more responsibly. 
According to our 2023 assessment, our contribution 
to these three strategic SDGs was unchanged from the 
previous year:

To compile this Statement, we assessed all impacts from our IP&L Statement 
against the UN SDGs. In some cases, where relevant, impact has been shared 
across more than one SDG. Results from our 2023 assessment show that 
ABN AMRO has measurable impact against 14 of the 17 SDGs. Please note 
that this table, unlike previous tables, shows positive or negative impact only, 
not the estimated size of impact. For more information on our approach to 
the SDGs, see our Integrated Annual Report, available online.

1. Consider the value chain
The first step to understanding our impact, is to 
understand our value chain. While we are responsible 
for the carbon emissions that arise at our offices and 
through our business travel, we are also associated 
with the emissions that arise in our value chain. This 
means we need to understand the impact arising 
upstream, at our suppliers, at our bank and 
downstream, impact arising at our clients, and at their 
clients or at the companies they invest in.
2. Measure our impact footprint
An impact footprint tells us about the size of the 
impact. For contribution to climate change the footprint 
is Carbon Dioxide equivalent (CO2 eq) emissions. This is 
the amount of gas emitted into the air that contributes 
to climate change. CO2 is included as are gases such 
as methane and nitrous oxide. Footprints are estimated 
using a combination of direct data gathered by the 
bank and secondary data which estimates how much 
CO2 eq emissions occur at clients or suppliers and 
within their value chains.
3. Monetise impact
Next, we apply a monetisation factor which reflects the 
desirability of an impact. Large negative monetisation 
factors demonstrate that an impact is very undesirable. 
We aim to use monetisation factors developed in 
alignment with international norms and standards and 
while this process can be argued to be subjective, 
monetisation offers a transparent and consistent 
Explained through an example, contribution to climate change.
approach for allowing us to weigh, compare and 
aggregate very different impacts. The monetisation 
value used here (-€0.17/kg) is the abatement cost for 
the 2-degree global warming target in the long term. 
This is in line with the Paris Agreement.1 
4. Attribute to the bank
The final step is attribution. While ABN AMRO creates 
some impact directly (see carbon emissions from their 
own buildings and travel), the majority of impact is

indirect. Since ABN AMRO is more directly associated 
with the impact arising at the bank, we attribute a 
higher share of these emissions to the bank, than we 
do of the carbon emisssions arising in the value chain. 
The share of emissions in the value chain is calculated 
by considering ABN AMRO’s added value, whilst 
avoiding any double counting. This means that the 
carbon emissions recorded here should not appear in 
the impact statements of other companies.

Key conceptual similarities and differences between the Impact Report and ESRS  
under CSRD
The Impact Report draws from impact methodologies such as the Impact-Weighted Accounts Framework (IWAF). 
While the Impact Report and CSRD/ESRS in part overlap, they also have important differences. The table below 
describes how key concepts are integrated in both the Impact Report and ESRS under CSRD.
Concept Key similarities and differences
Impact-based Reporting on positive and negative impacts is the core of both the Impact Report and ESRS. The Impact 
Report classifies the impacts under 6 capitals: Financial, Manufactured, Intellectual, Human, Social and 
Natural Capital, while ESRS reports under three areas: Environmental, Social and Governance. There are 
several topics which overlap between ESRS and the Impact Report, however not all ESRS impact topics 
are covered in the Impact Report (and vice versa).
In particular, governance is not included as an impact area in the Impact Report, as in Impact Thinking it 
is not considered as an impact in itself. Good or bad governance can influence the size of other impacts 
(e.g. a strong due diligence process for instance, can reduce the chance of deforestation and 
biodiversity loss within client value chains).
The Impact Report also presents impacts in monetary terms to integrate impact into business language 
and ensure comparability and cohesion in understanding for employees, investors and other 
stakeholders. In addition, monetary valuation enables trade-offs between social, environmental and 
financial topics by expressing them in the same language. Under CSRD monetisation is not required.
Double materiality Under CSRD a double materiality approach is required to order and select sustainability matters. This 
means the effect on both ABN AMRO and on stakeholders is considered in the selection of relevant topics.
Following the Impact methodology, we aim to give a bank-wide view on how the bank’s activities affect 
its stakeholders (clients, employees, investors and society). The Impact Report includes the quantitative 
estimation of all impact indicators.
Value chain The Impact Report estimates impact on stakeholders. As such, impact is estimated for all organisations 
throughout a value chain.
In the impact methodology, impacts are attributed across the organisation’s value chain to avoid double 
counting. Under CSRD on the other hand attribution is not prescribed.

How we measure impact on biodiversity
In this publication we base the biodiversity impact 
calculations on four drivers, the same ones that we use 
in the report to calculate our impact on natural capital. 
The key drivers considered are:
•
 Con
tribution to climate change
•
 Air
 pollution
•
 W
ater pollution 
•
 Land use change
Other
 drivers of biodiversity loss such as direct 
exploitation of natural resources and invasive species 
are not considered in our methodology. Reason for this 
is limited data availability.
Capturing biodiversity footprints
The four drivers are an aggregation of relevant 
indicators that are measured as either a direct physical 
footprint on biodiversity or as an indirect loss of 
biodiversity. 
Climate change and pollution are quantified with GHG 
or other emissions leading to environmental impacts, 
while land use change is measured by the use of land 
for economic activity in hectares, compared to land 
used for primary vegetation. 
Emissions and land use change have an effect on 
species abundance. To capture this effect on biodiversity, 
values are converted to biodiversity hectares (bio-ha). 
One bio-ha unit translates to the loss of one hectare 
with pristine biodiversity in a respective biome. 
Monetisation
Footprint results are monetised through the value of 
the ecosystem services lost. This allows to compare 
biodiversity loss with other impacts. 
The graph on the next page illustrates the steps 
associated with this measurement process in more 
detail.

Illustration of our approach to measuring the impact on biodiversity
The figure below illustrates the different steps taken to capture biodiversity impacts.  
Biodiversity loss is captured through four key drivers, namely climate change, air pollution, 
water pollution and land use. These drivers are captured through different indicators and 
translated into footprint results, indicating biodiversity loss. Footprint results are converted  
into monetised impacts using the value of the associated ecosystem services lost. This 
results in a total monetised biodiversity impact.
Other drivers are currently not 
captured in our methodology  
due to limited data availability

Glossary and acknowledgments
To the right we provide a more specific example 
of how we measure part of our biodiversity impact. 
The diagram shows the main components used to 
assess the impact of using previously undisturbed 
biomes (e.g. forests, grasslands) for cropland.
Broadly there are two stages to the calculation:
1
 Measur
e the footprint 
In this step, the reduction in species is measured per 
sector, crop and biome. For example, the total loss of 
species within the cereal grains sector, when 
naturally occurring forests are used for the 
production of wheat. This is biome and crop specific 
as they carry unique MSA (mean species abundance) 
values, or in other words, the amount of biodiversity 
is not the same across different cropland and 
biomes. This is divided by the total output per crop 
(measured in terms of economic value).
2
 Mone
tisation 
In this step, a monetary value is added to the impact. 
This is based on the value of ecosystem service loss 
associated with the biodiversity. More information on 
this methodology can be found in the Land use, Land 
use change, biodiversity and ecosystem services 
publication by True Price and Wageningen Economic 
Research.

Our approach to reporting
Our general approach
Wherever possible, this Report aims to follow the 
principles and concepts set out in the Impact-Weighted 
Accounts Framework (IWAF) published by the Impact 
Economy Foundation (IEF) as well as Impact Institute’s 
Framework for Impact Statements (FIS). Definitions, 
criteria and other requirements are drawn from the 
Impact Institute’s Integrated Profit & Loss Assessment 
Methodology (IAM) – core version. 
In addition to this Report, there is a separate, more 
detailed Note on Methodology, available online.  
Impact Statements
All Impact Statements, on pages 28-35, are in the form 
of an IP&L, showing value created or lost during the year 
for each of the bank’s main stakeholder groups. 
All assessments are based on chosen impacts; there 
are 57 impacts to represent the scale and breadth of 
the bank’s activities. Prior to inclusion, all impacts 
are monetised and assigned a euro-equivalent value. 
Impacts are shown by stakeholder group 
and/or capital. 
We use capitals taken from the <IR> Framework, 
though this year we have decided to combine 
manufactured, financial and intellectual capital into 
commercial capital to reflect the value created through 
our core activities. Definitions of these impacts may be 
found on pages 46-49. 
Our capitals are defined as follows: 
Commercial
A combination of the three capitals in the IP&L
•
 Manuf
actured: Fixed assets, including 
house values and the value of banking and 
investment services. 
•
 Financial:
 All money and financial assets. 
•
 In
tellectual: All internal systems, 
procedures, protocols and other forms of 
intellectual property. 
Human
• Individuals ’ time, skills and productivity  
(including the well-being effects of 
employment and workplace health and 
safety).
Social
• Social  ties, norms, networks and stakeholder 
relations (including the bank’s impact on 
social issues such as child labour, gender 
discrimination, low pay and financial distress 
among clients unable to repay loans).
Natural
• Social  ties, norms, networks and stakeholder 
relations (including the bank’s impact on 
social issues such as child labour, gender 
discrimination, low pay and financial distress 
among clients unable to repay loans).
Selecting impacts
To identify and select impacts, we use several sources, 
including:
•
 R
esults from similar exercises carried out by peers
•
 Existing impact studies fr
om ABN AMRO and other 
organisations
•
 Inputs fr
om subject-matter experts within the bank
The IAM lists impacts by groups or classes. Of these, 
most were in scope for our 2022 assessment, similar to 
the previous year. Other impacts were added from 
outside these lists – these were either specific to the 
banking sector or to relevant events (such as the 
Covid-19 pandemic). At the same time, some impacts 
were excluded, or their scope reduced, because of a 
lack of data. Examples of this are impacts related to 
individuals and society such as harassment, 
discrimination on the basis of race or disability, 
displacement of indigenous groups or other 
communities and freedom of opinion and expression. 
In addition positive impacts, especially related to 
biodiversity restoration and conservation are not 
included in this report. In other cases, scope was 
limited to reliable data only (for example, results for air 
and water pollution include only pollutants for which 
there is data on both emissions and valuations).

Scope and boundaries
Our assessment covers both direct impacts and 
impacts to which ABN AMRO contributes only indirectly 
(the latter may be client activities, for example, made 
possible by loans or investment services granted by the 
bank). 
This assessment covers: 
•
 9
5% of the bank’s activities in terms of internal 
impacts (i.e., those impacts already priced into the 
bank’s transactions). 
•
 8
0% of activities in terms of external impacts 
(i.e., those impacts not priced in, such as the effects 
on climate, environment, or human rights, reflected 
as external costs).
Updating our 2022 results
Impact Institute’s Global Impact Database (GID) has 
been updated to include most recently available data. 
The update resulted in minor changes to some impacts. 
Most notably, it led to a change in the impact of forced 
labour and contribution to final goods and services in 
the value chain.

Defining our stakeholders
We define our stakeholders as follows: 
Any group or individual the bank affects through its 
activities or products and services who, in turn, may 
affect the bank’s ability to achieve its goals.
Using this definition, we recognise four main stakeholder 
groups: clients, employees, investors and society: 
Clients
• Per sonal & Business Banking clients
•
 W
ealth Management clients
•
 Corpor
ate Banking clients
Employees
• F ull-time and part-time employees,  
sub-contractors
Investors
• Shar eholders, bondholders
Society
• Supplier s and external consultants, other 
business partners, local communities, 
governments, regulators and NGOs
Estimating impact
To estimate impact, we use both bottom-up and top-
down analysis. Bottom-up uses ABN AMRO data; top-
down uses both ABN AMRO and other external data to 
provide a more complete assessment (this applies to 
the bank’s corporate client, wealth management and 
supplier portfolios where it is not feasible to build 
bottom-up models since these relate to other 
companies or value chains). 
Within a value chain, it is possible that several 
organisations will contribute to a specific impact. In 
these cases, the total impact is divided among these 
organisations in a way that avoids double counting, but 
still ensures the entire impact is accounted for. To do 
this, impacts are categorised as follows: 
•
 Ca
tegory 1: impacts that may be attributed fully to 
ABN AMRO (because the activities in question are 
controlled directly by the bank). These are primarily 
internal impacts. In this case, there is no attribution 
of impact to other organisations. Examples include 
salaries paid to employees, payments to investors or 
suppliers, or payments made by clients in return for 
banking and other financial services. 
•
 Ca
tegory 2: impacts that may be attributed to 
several organisations, but for which one organisation 
is primarily associated with. Most external impacts 
fall into this category. In this case, most of the impact 
(at least 50%) is attributed to this one organisation. 
Examples include occupational health & safety, 
financial distress among clients unable to repay loans 
or mortgages, or contributions to climate change. 
In addition to the above, there is a third category 
relating to impacts that may be attributed to several 
organisations, but which arise at no organisation in 
particular. We identified no Category 3 impacts in our 
2023 assessment. 
Internal and external data sources
Internal data: data compiled by the bank itself, 
including ABN AMRO’s 2023 Financial 
Statements. Where 2023 data was not available, 
the most recent period was used instead. In 
some cases, full-year data was extrapolated from 
data from either the first three quarters or eleven 
months of the year.
External data: External data: economic, social 
and market data, including national statistics, 
international databases and academic research. 
Data was also taken from the Impact Institute.1
Four-step process
Our impact measurement is based on a four-step 
process (as set out in the FIS): 
•
 F
rame – define initial expectations and objectives
•
 Sc
ope – decide which activities and impacts should 
be included
•
 Measur
ement and valuation – collect all relevant 
data, calculate and monetise impact and define a 
value creation model, based on both bottom-up and 
top-down analyses
•
 R
eporting – analyse and confirm results
Our process is overseen by a Steering Committee, 
comprising members of ABN AMRO’s communications, 
strategy and sustainability teams. All findings are 
submitted to internal experts for review and approval 
prior to publication. 
1 This includes factors used to calculate euro-equivalents, data from the 
Impact Institute’s Global Impact Database and social and environmental 
data to assess supply chain impacts.

Compliance with Integrated Profit & Loss Assessment Methodology
This Report is written in accordance with the IAM. The table below shows how we comply with the IAM’s main 
principles and concepts: 
Principles and concepts ABN AMRO’s approach 
Impact contribution Our IP&L Assessment covers impacts from ABN AMRO’s own operations and its wider value chain.
Reference scenario Impact is reported as an absolute (rather than measured against an alternative scenario). Marginal 
impacts are not in scope.
Valuation Impact is shown in euro-equivalents, reflecting its value to stakeholders. Well-being impacts relate to 
the well-being of individuals. All individuals are weighted equally. Impacts affecting basic rights are 
based on estimated costs of remedying any infringement or violation.
Realised impact Our IP&L Assessment provides an overview of value created or lost in 2023 by both stakeholder group 
and capital.
Representativeness Most of the bank’s activities and impacts are included; B2B and B2C are assessed in separate analyses.
Balance This report aims to provide a balanced overview of both positive and negative impacts.
Conservativeness To assess impact, we use a best-estimate valuation. Where there is uncertainty, we generally select the 
more conservative option. This, in effect, minimises positive impacts and maximises negative.
Functional unit Our assessment relates to ABN AMRO Bank N.V.
Stakeholder scope This assessment covers the bank’s four main stakeholder groups (clients, employees, investors and society).
Capital scope All six <IR> capitals are covered by our assessment (human, social, natural and commercial, which 
combines manufactured, financial and intellectual).
Netting and aggregation External costs are not netted unless shown unaggregated elsewhere in the Report.
Further information on our approach may be found in our separate Note on Methodology, available online.

Description of impacts
This assessment is based on 57 impacts, as below: 
Commercial Description
Manufactured
1 Contribution to final goods and services  
in value chain
When the organisation engages in lending and investment, this contributes to the creation of goods and services that have value for final users 
(positive impact).
2 Client value through change in house value When homeowners see the value of their houses increase (or decrease) during the reporting period, this is shown as an increase (or decrease) in 
manufactured capital.
3 Client value of money transfers Client value of money transfers created by the bank through the provision of financial infrastructure (positive impact).
4 Client value of money storage and management Client value of money storage and management created by the bank through the provision of financial infrastructure (positive impact).
5 Client value of other infrastructure services Client value of other infrastructure services such as securities and custodian services provided by the bank (positive impact).
6 Value of infrastructure services provided by suppliers Value of infrastructure services provided by the bank’s suppliers, such as payments, securities and custodian services (negative impact).
7 Balance of value of goods received from suppliers 
and provided to buyers of divested assets
The balance of goods received from suppliers (represented by a negative change in manufactured capital for suppliers) and the divested assets of 
ABN AMRO to buyers of the assets (represented by a positive change in manufactured capital for buyers in society). A positive value indicates that 
the value of divested assets is larger than the value of goods purchased from suppliers, resulting in a net positive change in manufactured capital 
for society. A negative value indicates the value of goods purchased from suppliers is larger than the value of goods divested, resulting in a net 
negative change in manufactured capital for society.
8 Client value of housing Client value of living in a house as (co-) facilitated by the bank through mortgage provision (positive impact).
9 Gross increase in tangible assets Gross increase in value during the year of tangible assets such as property, plant and equipment (positive impact).
10 Depreciation of tangible assets Decrease in value through depreciation during the year of tangible assets such as property, plant and equipment (negative impact).
Financial
11 Payments by clients Payments from clients to the organisation (experienced as a negative impact on financial capital for clients).
12 Payments made by other stakeholders Payments from stakeholders other than clients to the organisation (experienced as a negative impact on financial capital for these stakeholders).
13 Payments to suppliers for expensed goods  
and services
Payments from the organisation to suppliers for payments included as expenses in the Income Statement (experienced as a positive change in 
financial capital for suppliers).

Financial
14 Employee payments Payments from the organisation relating to employee expenses, including gross salary and a number of social security and pension contributions 
(experienced as a positive change in financial capital for employees and the government through taxes).
15 Income tax payments Payments from the organisation to the government relating to income tax obligations (positive impact on financial capital for the government).
16 Interest payments Interest payments from the organisation to their clients, bondholders and others (positive impact in financial capital for these clients, bondholders 
and other stakeholders).
17 Net profit/loss If an organisation makes a net profit for a reporting year, this increases the organisation’s stock of financial capital and there is a positive change in 
capital. Part of this may, in turn, be used to pay dividends to shareholders. If the organisation makes a net loss, this reduces its stock of financial 
capital, and there is a negative change in the capital.
18 Corrections for non-financial profit items Various non-financial capital changes (e.g. depreciation) are recognised as income and expenses in the Income Statement. In the IP&L Assessment, 
these changes are recognised under their respective capitals. This group consists of changes to balance financial capital.
19 Balance of payments to suppliers for investments  
and from buyers for divested assets
The balance of payments from the organisation to suppliers for investments (not included as expenses in the Income Statement) and payments 
from buyers of divested, capitalised assets. A positive value indicates that payment to suppliers for investments is larger than payments received 
from buyers, which is a net positive change in financial capital for society. A negative value indicates that payments received from buyers are larger 
than payments to suppliers for investments, which is a net negative change in financial capital for society.
20 Cost of capital The cost of capital provided to the organisation by clients, equity holders, bondholders and others (negative impact).
21 Value of capital The value of capital provided to the organisation and to the organisation’s stakeholders (positive impact).
22 Value of services (financial) provided by suppliers When an organisation receives goods in some form from its suppliers, these represent negative changes in financial capital for suppliers.
23 Consumer client value of lending services  
(non-mortgage)
Value of (non-mortgage) lending services delivered by the organisation, which are experienced as positive changes in financial capital for consumer 
clients.
24 Business client value of lending services Value of lending services delivered by the organisation, experienced as positive changes in financial capital for business clients.
25 Consumer client value through home ownership Clients of the bank experience savings and other financial capital benefits from home ownership, represented as a positive change in financial 
capital for clients.
26 Change in share price not captured  
in comprehensive income
A positive (negative) change in the organisation’s share price – to the extent this is not captured in comprehensive income – generates a positive 
(negative) change in financial capital for shareholders.
27 Added value of prevented bankruptcies due  
to Covid-19 financial support measures
Added value loss avoided because of bankruptcies prevented by Covid-19-related financial support provided by the bank to clients (positive 
impact on financial capital for clients and society).
28 Contribution to tax collection through  
payment systems
Additional tax revenue that is collected from governments as a result of digital payment systems provided by the bank (positive impact for society).
29 Other financial impacts Other changes in financial capital to the organisation and its stakeholders relating to the organisation’s operations.

(indirect impact).
35 Unintended incidents with personal information Unintended incidents regarding data and client privacy are represented as negative impacts and external costs.
Human Description
36 Well-being effects of employment The increase in employees’ well-being caused by employment through, among other things, effects on self-esteem, autonomy, social relations,  
and social status (positive impact when contributing to employment; negative impact when contributing to unemployment).
37 Creation of human capital Increases in the expected value add generated due to improved productivity as a result of working at the organisation.
38 Value of employee time spent on work The value of time employees spend on work, representing a negative (opportunity) cost for employees, since during the time they work they cannot 
do other valuable activities.
39 Value of services provided by suppliers Value of services purchased by the organisation, representing (predominantly) negative changes in human capital for suppliers of the services.
40 Occupational health and safety incidents Fatal and non-fatal occupational incidents and diseases in the workplace, constituting negative impacts and external costs. This applies both to 
occurrences at the organisation itself (direct impacts) and those in the value chain (indirect impacts).
41 Effect on health and safety due to Covid-19 Covid-19-related illnesses in the workplace, representing a negative impact for employees. Further, the spread of the virus from employees to 
others outside the organisation represents a negative impact for society.
Social Description
42 Decrease in cash-related crime Decrease in harm to clients from robberies and fraudulent banknotes due to the provision of a digital payment infrastructure (positive impact).
43 Change in brand value and customer loyalty Changes in brand value and customer loyalty, represented as changes in the organisation’s social capital (since these are assets that help the 
organisation attract and retain clients and employees).
44 Gender inequality Gender inequality refers to unequal access to highly skilled jobs on the basis of gender. In addition, this impact considers the difference in salaries 
between women and men. A gender pay gap, as either a direct or indirect impact, constitutes a negative impact and an external cost.
