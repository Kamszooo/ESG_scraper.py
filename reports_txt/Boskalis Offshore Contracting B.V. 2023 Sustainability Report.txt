CHAIR’S  
STATEMENT 
Boskalis can look back proudly on 2023 with an impressive 
performance across all three divisions; all the more so in light of 
the economic and political turmoil in many parts of the world. 
We ended the year with an exceptional set of financial results, 
recording revenue of EUR 4.3 billion and EBITDA of EUR 1 billion, 
marking 2023 as the best year in our long history. Over the last  
12 months, we have continued to make a critical contribution to the 
energy transition, while also protecting populations against the 
consequences of climate change. At the same time, we continue to 
invest in the sustainable growth of Boskalis and prioritize 
innovation to tackle the sustainability challenges of today.
As we look back on our first full year since we became fully part of the HAL 
portfolio, our commitment to our Sustainable Growth strategy remains stronger 
than ever. In 2023, we strengthened the governance around ESG and we updated 
our materiality process with our first double materiality assessment. Reflecting on 
the outcome of that process, it is pleasing to see that among the sustainability 
topics ranked as most important by our stakeholders are the energy transition and 
climate adaptation – both activities at the heart of our strategy. Where, for some, 
these topics may present a significant risk or imply negative impacts, for Boskalis 
they are both important opportunities and serve as key drivers of our business. 
PROTECTING AGAINST THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
As populations in the Netherlands and across the globe come under growing 
pressure from extreme weather events and rising sea levels, our expertise in the 
field of climate-adaptive solutions is becoming increasingly relevant. This became 
particularly visible in late 2023 when significant parts of the Netherlands were at 
risk of flooding following extreme precipitation in northwestern Europe. Investments 
in the Netherlands over the past decade in climate adaptation solutions such as 
the Flood Protection Program and Room for the River, and our own contributions 
such as the ongoing work on the multi-year project to reinforce the Markermeer 
dikes north of Amsterdam, are proving to be both necessary and effective.
Post year end we secured a contract for the protection and replenishment of a 
stretch of eroded coastline in Togo, West Africa, and as part of the West African 
Coastal Areas Management (WACA) program. The contract was awarded by the 
government of Togo and was made possible through an innovative financing 
package. This project is a follow-up to a previous cross-border Togo-Benin WACA 
project that Boskalis successfully completed in 2023.
ADVANCING THE ENERGY TRANSITION
Boskalis continues to advance the energy transition by developing infrastructure 
for renewable energy. Over the last decade we have worked on more than 
100 offshore wind projects covering Europe, the United States, and Taiwan. 2023 
was our busiest year yet, and we were involved in 29 wind farms worldwide, 
representing 50% of our Offshore Energy division revenue. Our activities included 
4


Page 7:
marine survey, unexploded ordnance removal, seabed preparation, 
and the transportation and installation of turbine foundations, 
substations, and subsea cables. We completed our first wind project 
in the United States with thirteen monopile foundations and an 
offshore substation for the South Fork Wind development off Rhode 
Island. The project was unique in many ways with the Bokalift 2 
installing her first monopiles following the installation of an advanced 
Motion Compensated Pile Gripper Frame earlier in the year. We were 
also busy in Taiwan with the completion of the Changfang & Xidao 
wind farm and ongoing support on the Yunlin project, as well as 
multiple activities related to the Moray West development off the east 
coast of Scotland.
INNOVATION
Along with our craftsmanship and years of experience, at Boskalis 
we are constantly looking to innovate. This may take the form of 
modern and efficient upgrades to our existing equipment, designing 
and investing in efficient low-carbon next-generation assets, 
alternative contract structures with our clients and partners, or the
groundbreaking work methods we develop on projects. As we look to 
extend our capabilities as a business, we also seize the opportunities 
available to us to limit our impact on the environment. In October 
2023, we announced the order of a large state-of-the-art trailing suction 
hopper dredger that will be equipped to run on methanol. 
ROAD TO NET ZERO 
During 2023, we made good progress on our emission reduction 
efforts and completed a study into how we can measure and monitor 
our progress towards net zero by 2050. We support the net zero 
2050 transition pathway for international shipping set by the 
International Maritime Organization (IMO) in July 2023. This industry 
pathway includes a mid-term reduction ambition to reduce carbon 
intensity by 2030. In line with this pathway, we aim to achieve a 
10% reduction in carbon intensity relative to 2023 through several 
energy efficiency measures and the use of renewable fuels. A carbon 
intensity ratio, developed in-house, which is in line with the IMO 
intensity ratio will, allow us to monitor progress against our ambition 
and track the energy efficiency of our vessels. 
COMMUNITY IMPACT
I continue to take pride in our work with local communities on our 
projects around the world and, in particular, the tremendous efforts 
taken in the Philippines in support of the Manila International Airport 
project. I was also pleased to see a confirmation of this in the positive 
assessment that followed an independent review commissioned by the 
Dutch government focused on the project’s environmental and social 
(E&S) risks. A report submitted last July by independent consultants to 
the Dutch Ministry of Finance described the project’s E&S monitoring 
process as “structured, robust and intensive”. Along with our client, 
we have developed and executed several E&S action plans to ensure 
the project meets international standards and we are proud of the 
numerous positive interventions that contribute to the socio-economic 
development of the Philippines. 
CARE FOR OUR PEOPLE
Safety is our top priority and through our No Injuries, No Accidents 
program we ensure that it receives the full and undivided attention of 
every one of us. Although we can look back on a successful year as a 
company, there is also a shadow that hangs over 2023 following two 
fatalities at our operations. On behalf of the Board of Management, 
I express our sincere condolences to the respective families of our 
colleagues. Under the leadership of the Board of Management, our 
priority in 2024 will be to intensify our focus on safety in the workplace. 
During the year good progress was made in establishing our new 
corporate office in Abu Dhabi. I am confident that this regional hub 
will help us secure the talent needed to meet the exciting challenges 
that lie ahead. Meanwhile, our focus remains on supporting managers 
to develop their teams and giving our employees the knowledge and 
skills to progress their careers within the company. Following last 
year’s Creating our Horizon employee engagement survey, we have 
focused on stress and well-being within the workplace. Over the 
upcoming period we will be taking steps to facilitate dialogue and 
more proactive interventions on this important topic.
LOOKING AHEAD
After such a strong year, the challenge becomes to sustain this level 
of success over the upcoming period. The outlook in many of our 
market segments is good and, with a well-filled order book, I look 
ahead with confidence. I am also optimistic thanks to the great team 
of people we have at Boskalis and who were at the heart of 
everything we achieved in 2023.
On behalf of the Board of Management, I would like to thank all of 
our colleagues for their remarkable dedication and contribution over 
the past year. I would also like to thank our clients, partners and our 
shareholder for their part in making 2023 such a successful year for 
Boskalis.

OUR BUSINESS 
IN A CHANGING WORLD
In monitoring and developing our 
corporate strategy we keep a clear 
eye on the long-term trends that 
underpin the Boskalis business model. 
Population growth and rising levels  
of prosperity are the overarching 
trends that propel our business, 
resulting in a need for more energy, 
as well as marine and inland 
infrastructure, to support economic 
growth and increasing levels of world 
trade.
By the year 2040, the global population is anticipated to surpass nine billion, with 
nearly 70% of people, along with associated assets and infrastructure, residing on 
less than 1% of the world’s land area. This concentrated population will often be 
in close proximity to water, with some areas being reclaimed land. Simultaneously, 
growth in emerging markets is expected to outpace that of advanced economies, 
and the average Gross Domestic Product per capita is forecast to rise globally by 
approximately 45% over the next two decades. This growing and more affluent 
population living in coastal regions underpins the drivers of our business: world 
trade, energy consumption and climate change.
The World Bank underscores that infrastructure services are fundamental to 
development, supporting essential services that align with countries’ economic, 
social, and environmental objectives. Specifically, the construction of trade-related 
infrastructure is recognized as a pivotal element in progress towards achieving the 
United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Global trade is projected 
to continue its growth, with a notable impact on interregional shipping in Asia. 
Boskalis stands to benefit from this growth, as well as the trend towards larger 
vessels with deeper drafts, necessitating investments in port infrastructure.

These demographic and economic trends heighten the worldwide 
demand for energy. While some of this demand can be met by 
existing power generation, substantial investments in new energy 
sources will be imperative. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has 
estimated that USD 44 trillion will be needed for new energy supply 
infrastructure between now and 2040. At the same time, addressing 
climate change requires a substantial shift in investment away from 
fossil fuels towards renewables.
The pace and trajectory of the energy transition will determine the 
scale and focus areas for capital investment. Despite the growth in 
renewables, traditional energy sources, such as oil and gas, are 
expected to remain significant components of the global energy mix. 
Irrespective of the speed and path of the transition, the impacts of 
climate change, including rising sea levels and more frequent extreme 
weather events, will persist, driving demand for climate adaptive 
measures. Given that 75% of major world cities are situated on the 
coast, an estimated annual investment of USD 77 billion will be 
necessary to keep flood risks at their current levels. Without this level 
of expenditure, the cost of flood damage is projected to increase 
exponentially by the end of the century.
In summary, the mid- to long-term macro trends relevant to Boskalis 
are conducive to its business model. The structural growth and 
increasing prosperity of the global population, particularly in coastal 
areas, fuel the demand for raw materials and energy, fostering 
global trade. Concurrently, climate change necessitates substantial 
investments in transitioning to renewable energy sources. Despite 
the climatic changes resulting from current and near-term emissions, 
addressing these effects through adaptive measures will require 
significant investments. These macro trends collectively fuel demand 
for maritime infrastructure, positioning them as key drivers of sustainable 
growth for our business. Boskalis’ portfolio of activities will therefore 
remain highly relevant over time, presenting ample opportunities to 
contribute to addressing the major societal challenges of our era.

OUR APPROACH
SUSTAINABLE GROWTH 
Our focus on sustainable growth lies at the heart of our business strategy. Through 
the strategy we seek to incorporate sustainability across our activities, a process 
which is informed by our periodic materiality assessment and our broader 
management of our environmental and social impact. Our Sustainable Growth 
strategy has been developed and is overseen by the Board of Management.
Our strategy is structured around three activity clusters and the value they bring  
to society with the objective of creating sustainable growth:
 
  Advance the Energy Transition: we help expand access to renewable power and 
facilitate the energy transition by developing infrastructure to deliver affordable 
and clean energy; 
  Create Innovative Infrastructure: we facilitate world trade, support economic 
development, and create infrastructure and new land for society; and  
  Protect through Climate Adaptation: we help protect populations and the natural 
environment from the consequences of climate change, such as rising sea levels 
and extreme weather conditions, through our coastal defense and riverbank 
protection activities. 
A fourth area – our marine salvage business – creates additional benefits by 
salvaging vessels and their cargo whilst protecting seas and oceans from 
pollutants and environmental damage.
Purpose
We create and protect prosperity and advance the energy transition. 
Mission 
We strive to be the leading dredging and marine contracting experts, 
creating new horizons for all our stakeholders.

Page 13:
GOOD STEWARDSHIP 
Good Stewardship is the first, overarching, pillar supporting our 
business strategy and fundamental to the success of the company. 
Good Stewardship dictates the effective management of risks and 
opportunities related to our business and is thereby pivotal to our 
ability to achieve sustainable growth. Focal topics are identified from 
both the outcome of our periodic materiality assessment, as well as 
our structured approach to managing our broader social and 
environmental impact. They include the following:
Responsible Business Conduct: our focus on integrity and business 
ethics which is underpinned by our Responsible Business Principles, 
policy framework and business ethics program. Our Responsible 
Business Principles, are detailed in the Boskalis Code of Conduct 
and in our Supplier Code of Conduct. We align ourselves to the 
United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the UN 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the OECD 
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the conventions of the 
International Labour Organization. 
Safety and Occupational Health: we aim to provide a safe, injury- 
and accident-free working environment, while supporting the broader 
well-being of our employees and subcontractors. Our long-standing 
No Injuries, No Accidents (NINA) health and safety program is an 
important part of the Good Stewardship pillar. 
Biodiversity and Ecosystems: we also aim to be an industry leader in 
the development of nature-based solutions to protect and enhance 
coastal ecosystems. Through our structured approach to managing 
environmental risks we aim to prevent and mitigate negative impacts 
on marine life or local habitats, such as those linked to invasive 
species, turbidity or pollution.
Social and Community Impact: the active management of our social 
engagement in the regions and communities where we work. The 
majority of our work takes place offshore, however, our operations 
can impact local communities at the coast or inland. This impact may 
be either positive – through the creation of jobs and opportunities for 
trade and economic growth – or, potentially, negative, through 
disturbance or changes to the local environment. Wherever possible, 
we enhance the positive impact we can have and mitigate or offset 
negative outcomes of our work. 
Emissions: We have committed to becoming climate neutral across our 
global operations by 2050 and support the net zero 2050 transition 
pathway for international shipping set by the International Maritime 
Organization (IMO) in July 2023. We have also set mid-term targets 
for certain parts of the organization. As such, we aim to further 
reduce emissions and drive our competitive advantage through our 
ability to offer accessible, low-carbon solutions to our clients. See 
pages 34 to 37 for more details on our emission reduction program.
Good Stewardship also guides our interventions to enhance the 
positive and prevent or minimize any negative impacts of our 
operations. We focus our efforts on the above topics to develop new 
technologies and more sustainable ways of executing projects for our 
clients. To support our progress on these sustainability topics, we have 
articulated high-level ambitions and set measurable targets where 
possible.
HUMAN EXCELLENCE 
Our people are considered our most important asset and a 
determining factor for our success. Our approach to human capital is 
therefore a key pillar of our business strategy and pivotal to our ability 
to achieve sustainable growth while managing the impact of our 
activities on our people and the world around us. Through the Human 
Excellence pillar within our Corporate Business Plan, we are 
committed to developing the skills and career ambitions of our people 
and creating the right conditions for everyone to reach their full 
potential. To achieve this, we foster effective leadership and ensure 
that employees are in control of their own personal development, 
giving them the time and resources to prioritize their performance and 
progress. By doing so, we put ourselves in a position of strength to 
meet the sustainability challenges and objectives of our activities and 
ensure the sustainable growth of our business.
DISTINGUISHING ASSETS 
Together with our human capital, Boskalis’ strength lies in its ability to 
deploy proprietary, distinguishing assets. During the current business 
plan period 2022 to 2024, we expect to invest EUR 1.5 billion in 
assets, comprising a combination of new builds, vessel modifications, 
and acquisitions of existing vessels for both the dredging and offshore 
energy divisions. During 2023 we signed a contract with Dutch 
shipbuilding company Royal IHC to build a large trailing suction 
hopper dredger with a capacity of 31,000 m3 that will be ready to 
run on methanol as an alternative fuel. Thanks to its advanced design 
and state-of-the-art technology, this vessel marks a significant step in 
making Boskalis’ dredging fleet more sustainable (for more details 
please see page 24).
In the first half of 2023, we converted a former transport vessel into a 
subsea rock installation vessel. The modified vessel, the Seapiper, is 
equipped to install rock protection for both the cables and foundations 
relating to various offshore wind projects in the years ahead. 
Within the Offshore Energy division, Boskalis has built up a versatile 
fleet, mainly by acquiring vessels and in certain cases modifying 
them. The advantages of acquiring and modifying existing assets 
include the ability to extend the lifetime of vessels; a more sustainable 
approach when compared to a new build. During the current business 
plan period, Boskalis intends to selectively expand its offshore fleet 
11


Page 14:
with assets geared to serving the offshore renewables market in 
addition to the traditional offshore market. Before the end of the year, 
we also completed the retrofit of the first of numerous offshore vessels 
with an Energy Storage System, or ‘power pack’. The conversions will 
reduce the vessels’ fuel consumption and associated carbon dioxide 
and nitrogen oxide emissions by an average of up to 20% during  
DP operations. For further information please see page 34.
DOUBLE MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT
Boskalis conducted its first materiality assessment in 2015. Since then, 
the assessment has evolved and been updated on a biennial basis in 
line with international reporting standards, including the Global 
Reporting Initiative (GRI). The process of identifying topics of potential 
importance has included peer analyses, direct engagement with key 
stakeholders such as clients, industry experts, suppliers, and NGOs, 
as well as perception surveys and (social) media analysis. While the 
overall approach has remained fairly consistent over the years, the 
assessment in 2023 marked a significant development since it was 
the first time that we applied the principle of double materiality as 
defined within the European Sustainability Reporting Standards 
(ESRS). The most important steps and results of the Boskalis 2023 
double materiality assessment (DMA) are set out below.
In 2023, Boskalis formed an ESG Steering Committee, chaired by our 
CEO, to oversee the process of the DMA in addition to other ESG 
matters. The Steering Committee held a total of six meetings in 2023. 
A review of Boskalis’ 2021 materiality assessment and stakeholder 
engagement process was conducted as the point of departure for 
identifying and defining the relevant topics for the DMA. As a part of 
the 2021 materiality assessment, stakeholders were given the 
opportunity to provide feedback on topics they considered important 
but had not been addressed in the assessment. A review was also 
completed of the current business activities, client types and 
geographies served by Boskalis. The list of topics was further 
verified against the corporate strategy, international ESG reporting

frameworks and standards (including ESRS), sector trends and ESG 
client questionnaires in order to validate the strategic themes for the 
assessment. Definitions of all the topics were reviewed to help ensure 
a neutral (non-leading) framing. The final list of 17 sustainability topics 
and accompanying definitions was approved by the ESG Steering 
Committee.
We then commissioned an independent third party to formulate a 
questionnaire and complete an online assessment to assess the 
materiality of the impacts, risks and opportunities as the basis for the 
sustainability statement. The process sought the views of almost 
600 individuals across eight stakeholder groups, including clients, 
suppliers, NGOs, partner organizations and experts, and young or 
prospective employees. Nearly 100 members of Boskalis’ senior 
management, including all members of our Board of Management 
and Supervisory Board, were also invited to participate.
Through a carefully structured questionnaire, both external and 
internal stakeholders were asked to rank the sustainability topics that 
they considered to be most and least relevant for Boskalis from both 
an impact and financial perspective, according to the so-called 
‘MaxDiff’ methodology. MaxDiff is short for Maximum Difference 
Scaling which is a statistical survey technique commonly used to 
assess preferences among a set of items. The third party analyzed the 
survey response data and the impacts, risks and opportunities were 
given a quantitative score and respective ranking. In terms of 
outcomes, one of the third party’s key observations was the high level 
of consistency between stakeholder groups. The relative importance of 
the topics is presented in the resulting materiality matrix on page 12. 
The outcome of the DMA is broadly consistent with the previous 
process completed in 2021 which is encouraging from the perspective 
of Boskalis’ ESG strategy, KPI setting, and sustainability reporting.
WHAT WE HAVE LEARNT
The outcome of the 2023 DMA illustrates the relative importance of a 
shortlist of 17 sustainability topics to our business and our internal and 
external stakeholders. The outcome and resulting double materiality 
matrix is closely aligned with that of our previous assessment in 2021 
and the impacts, risks and opportunities catered for within our current 
Corporate Business Plan. Changes compared to the impact materiality 
assessment conducted in 2021 include the increased primacy that 
both internal and external stakeholders attached to two of our core 
business activities, namely, Climate Adaptation and Energy Transition. 
For Boskalis, Climate Adaptation involves safeguarding populations 
and the environment from the impacts of climate change, such as 
rising sea levels and extreme weather events, through projects like 
coastal defense and riverbank protection. Our Energy Transition 
activities focus on advancing the energy transition by establishing 
infrastructure that facilitates the delivery of renewable, reliable, and 
affordable energy. The 2023 assessment also saw the topic of 
Innovation rise in prominence among our stakeholders reflecting the 
importance of constantly developing new methods and technologies 
that increase our activities’ efficiency and environmental sustainability.
The relevant topics are embedded within our business strategy, on the 
basis of which we seek to formulate key performance indicators and 
targets in order to monitor and address specific risks and impacts and 
pursue opportunities for the company. It should be noted that for a 
significant portion of our 17 sustainability topics, there exists an 
inseparable blend of risks, opportunities, and positive and negative 
impacts. Therefore, where a particular sustainability topic qualifies as 
material, it can be from either one, some, or all of these impact 
perspectives.

revenue. This revenue was generated across 
29 different wind farms through a range of 
services
Boskalis advances the energy transition by creating infrastructure that helps deliver 
renewable, reliable, and affordable energy. Access to lower-carbon energy is 
considered a global imperative for sustained socio-economic development and, as 
part of our core business, we deliver a broad range of services that are crucial to 
developing renewable energy sources while maintaining sufficient energy supply. 
At the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Dubai (COP28) in late 2023 
more than 120 countries signed a pledge to triple the world’s installed renewable 
energy generation capacity to at least 11,000 gigawatts by 2030. We facilitate 
the delivery of low-carbon solutions such as wind energy and over the last decade 
have worked on more than 100 offshore wind projects covering Europe, the 
United States and Taiwan. We have a strong and successful track record in 
transporting and installing offshore wind farms, mainly relating to foundations and 
cables and, in 2023, these activities accounted for 50% of our Offshore Energy 
division revenue. 
Developers in the offshore wind industry have faced a challenging environment in 
2023 caused by a combination of factors, including regulatory uncertainty, supply 
chain disruptions, and the rising cost of materials and industry services. Meanwhile, 
rising global interest rates have pushed up the cost of borrowing when it comes to 
financing offshore developments. However, in spite of these industry headwinds, 
of Boskalis’ total Offshore Energy order book, a record amount is related to 
offshore wind activities. 
The last 12 months have been busy for Boskalis in the offshore wind market. In 
2023, we have been involved in 29 offshore wind projects worldwide with a 
broad range of activities, including the installation of 83 wind turbine and 
sub-station foundations, subsea cable installation, scour protection, transportation 
of foundations and substations, geophysical and geotechnical survey and 
preparations of the seabed.
In July the crane vessel Bokalift 1 successfully installed the last of 62 jacket 
foundations for the Changfang & Xidao offshore wind farm in Taiwan, where 
Boskalis was also involved in the construction of the Yunlin wind farm. Over the 
course of three summer seasons working on Changfang & Xidao we have 
transported and installed a total of 186 pin piles as well as the jackets 
approximately 15 kilometers off Taiwan’s western coast. The completed windfarm 
has a total capacity of 600 MW.
In recent years, Boskalis has built a strong position in the United States with local 
representation, serving the fast-growing offshore wind market off the US East 
coast. A significant portion of the installation work for the South Fork Wind and 
Revolution Wind projects was awarded to Boskalis in 2021. The Bokalift 1, 
Bokalift 2 and our rock installation vessel Rockpiper were also active at the Moray 
West wind farm in the North Sea.
Several new projects were acquired during the year, including the large Baltica 2 
offshore wind cable project. The wind farm development is located in the Polish 
section of the Baltic Sea, approximately 40 kilometers off the coast of Poland. 
With a total capacity of up to 1.5 GW it will be the country’s largest renewable 
energy project to date.

The increasing pace of development of floating offshore wind 
technology opens up new opportunities for Boskalis. The benefits of 
floating wind farms include the ability to install them in much deeper 
water than fixed farms, therefore opening up many new prospects, 
particularly in light of ambitious decarbonization targets being set by 
governments around the globe. In 2023 Boskalis completed a pilot 
project in Ishikari Bay off the coast of northern Japan which involved 
the installation of a pole of more than 60 meters that would serve as 
one of three piles needed for a so-called Tension Leg Platform (TLP) 
– the foundation for a floating offshore wind turbine. Although more 
common in the oil and gas industry, TLPs can be adopted for floating 
wind farms in deeper waters. The pilot project yielded important 
knowledge about installation methods and logistics that can be 
applied on future projects.
In addition to our facilitating activities in the renewables industry, our 
decommissioning expertise helps reduce the environmental footprint 
of the offshore oil and gas industry, ranging from preparation and 
removal of offshore platforms to onshore disposal and recycling. For 
much of the year we carried out decommissioning work at depths of 
up to 150 meters in the North Sea. On behalf of our client, more 
than 22 kilometers of flowline and umbilical were safely brought to 
the surface along with several heavy construction piles, manifolds, 
and drilling templates. More than 500 concrete mattresses that had 
been installed on the seabed decades ago to protect the installed 
cables and pipelines were also removed. Over the course of the 
project more than 4,000 tons of waste was recovered from the sea, 
of which 97% was either treated, recycled or re-used. 
At Boskalis we see that a transition to cleaner energy is driving 
growth in renewables, but the growing demand for energy means 
that the dependence on fossil fuels is expected to continue in the short 
to mid-term. At COP28 countries reached a deal to transition away 
from fossil fuels in an attempt to reach global net zero emissions by 
2050. The same agreement also stressed the need for transitional 
fuels to support the energy mix as the world makes this vital switch. 
We foresee that natural gas in particular, with its lower carbon 
intensity, will serve as an important transition fuel and thereby 
Boskalis has an important role to play by providing our services as 
part of the energy transition. Services include survey, IRM, seabed 
intervention, offshore transport and installation, and dredging-related 
activities. These services and our associated assets are flexible and 
market agnostic, meaning Boskalis can simultaneously support 
transitional energy projects, rig decommissioning, and offshore wind 
activities to meet cross-sectoral client demand.
UNITED STATES: SOUTH FORK WIND FARM 
During 2023 Boskalis completed its first contract in the United States 
for the transportation and installation of monopile foundations and an 
offshore sub-station for the 132 MW South Fork Wind development 
off the state of Rhode Island. The development is owned by a 50:50 
joint venture between Ørsted and Eversource and will provide clean, 
renewable energy to Long Island.
Over the summer of 2023, we installed thirteen foundations which 
were all transported from Europe. In line with local regulations and 
Boskalis’ own Biodiversity Framework the project included a detailed 
Marine Mammal Observation (MMO) program which saw the 
deployment of trained and certified MMO-observers and the use of 
thermal cameras. Active steps were taken to reduce the noise levels 
from the piling site and our activities were immediately ceased if any 
sea mammals entered the vicinity.
The South Fork Wind turbine foundations are some of the largest in 
the world, up to 104 meters in length with a bottom diameter of 10 
meters and weighing more than 1,800 tons. South Fork Wind is the 
first US-commissioned offshore wind farm in US Federal waters and it 
will supply 70,000 households with green power.
SCOTLAND: MORAY WEST WIND FARM
In 2023 Boskalis was active in the construction of the Moray West 
offshore wind farm off the east coast of Scotland. On behalf of its 
client, Boskalis has been contracted to execute several activities –
geophysical surveys, transporting the foundations (monopiles), 
preparation of the seabed, and installation of foundations – that 
contribute to the development of this renewable energy project. The 
contract was awarded by Ocean Winds, the 50:50 joint venture 
between EDP Renewables and ENGIE that is dedicated to offshore 
wind energy.
The Moray West offshore wind farm is located in the Moray Firth and 
the 882 MW development will have the capacity to power up to 
640,000 homes in the United Kingdom. A total of 60 offshore wind 
turbines and two substations are required, all fixed on monopile 
foundations. Based on the large turbine size (14.7 megawatts) and 
water depth (up to 54 meters), extremely large monopiles weighing 
up to 2,000 tons each are being used for this development.
Boskalis has been able to offer its broad range of capabilities in this 
project and during 2023 carried out an offshore geophysical site 
survey that also included a survey for identification of unexploded 
ordnance. Prior to the installation of the foundations, Boskalis also 
completed seabed preparation activities by installing a layer of rock 
that will act as a filter and scour protection for the monopiles.

CLIMATE 
ADAPTATION 
For over a century Boskalis has been providing protection against the forces of 
nature. The growing consequences of climate change mean our expertise in the 
field of climate-adaptive solutions is becoming increasingly relevant on a global 
scale. Rising sea levels, together with a growing number of extreme weather 
events caused by climate change, threaten the safety and livelihoods of more than 
one billion people worldwide. 
Our innovative, sustainable solutions to develop coastal and shoreline protection 
contribute to SDG 13, Climate Action and, where possible, also include so-called 
nature-based solutions which make use of natural processes and materials. During 
the year we worked on 19 climate adaptation projects which accounted for 7% of 
the company’s revenue.
Among the countries forecast to be significantly impacted by rising sea levels in 
the coming decades is Bangladesh, where a significant coastal population is 
already vulnerable to storm surges and other extreme weather events. The World 
Bank forecasts that by 2050 an additional nine million people will be at risk due 
to climate change. In Mozambique, coastal adaptation and nature-based solutions 
are deemed to be investment priorities as the country seeks to bolster its climate 
resilience along its 2,700-kilometer coast. The country’s economy relies heavily on 
marine activities such as fishing and blue tourism.
In the Netherlands, Boskalis has a strong track record in coastline maintenance 
and constructing flood defenses. Research for the national Delta Program and the 
Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management (I&W) concluded in late 2023 
that the dikes and dunes that currently protect the coastline will need to be 
bolstered in the coming decades if they are to remain effective. Sea levels may 
rise by as much as three meters in the run up to 2100, requiring dikes up to ninety 
meters wide to protect the country’s interior. From 2040 onwards, it is forecast that 
further sand replenishment will be needed to maintain coastlines and protect  
Dutch fresh water supplies from the encroaching sea.
FINANCING CLIMATE ADAPTIVE SOLUTIONS 
Since the Paris Agreement of 2015, climate adaptation has risen on the global 
agenda. However, while significant work is being done towards enhancing 
adaptive capacities, efforts towards emission reduction continue to receive the 
lion’s share of global climate finance. Adaptation finance remains far below the 
scale necessary to adequately respond to the impacts of climate change, and 
almost all of it comes from the public sphere. This is especially the case for flood 
protection and coastal zone management which, although they provide vital 
public benefits, struggle to create tangible direct returns for investors. 
At the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Dubai in late 
2023 pledges totaling almost USD 200 million were made to the United Nations 
Adaptation Fund. However, progress towards the goal of doubling adaptation 
finance contributions to USD 40 billion by 2025 remains slow. Private sector 
investment is critical to closing the adaptation financing gap. In recent years there 
has been widespread discussion about ways to mobilize and facilitate private 
investment to support objectives related to climate change adaptation and 
resilience. The implementation of regulatory and policy measures (such as the 
Paris Agreement and the EU Green Deal) and the global focus on climate issues

have led to significant interest among banks, funds, investors, and 
insurers in sustainable opportunities and climate-resilient projects.  
But despite this growing interest, the need to meet investment criteria 
for bankable projects means that deploying commercial capital 
remains challenging.
Boskalis continues to seek financially feasible opportunities that create 
sustainable protective measures for the environment and communities 
living in coastal areas. We leverage our global network and engage 
with industry partners and stakeholders such as governments, financial 
(development) institutions, and developers to share our expertise and 
explore opportunities to support the implementation of sustainable and 
climate-adaptive solutions.
Post year end Boskalis secured a contract for the protection and 
replenishment of a stretch of eroded coastline in Togo, West Africa. 
The coastal protection project is part of the West African Coastal 
Areas Management (WACA) program and follows on from a previous 
Togo - Benin cross-border coastline project which Boskalis successfully 
completed in 2023.
This new contract was awarded by the government of Togo and was 
made possible through an innovative financing package. The Dutch 
impact development institution, Invest International, is providing an 
official development assistance foreign aid grant, alongside a loan 
from the French development agency, AFD. The contract carries a 
combined value of approximately EUR 50 million.
The West African coastline suffers from significant erosion, resulting in 
coastal retreat, threatening vital infrastructure and the livelihoods of 
the local population. In Togo, the average erosion rate is more than 
two meters per year, with much higher rates observed locally. Under 
the project, 22 new groins will be constructed in conjunction with a 
beach replenishment program over several coastal segments covering 
about seven kilometers.
CLIMATE ADAPTATION IN ACTION
Over the last 12 months, we have been involved in several climate 
adaptation projects in the Netherlands where the value of our 
expertise was clear to see when large parts of the country faced a risk 
of flooding following the extreme autumn rainfall in northwestern 
Europe. Investment over the past decade in climate-adaptive solutions 
through Dutch initiatives such as Room for the River and the National 
Flood Protection Program are proving to be both necessary and 
effective. Under the latter, we made strong progress in 2023 on the 
multi-year project to reinforce the Markermeer dikes north of 
Amsterdam which protect around 1.2 million people living in the 
hinterland. The Markermeer dikes are part of the Zuiderzee dikes that 
for centuries have protected the hinterland from the former Zuiderzee 
and the present Markermeer lake. More than 30 kilometers of the 
dikes no longer meet Dutch standards for water safety. During the 
year, the reinforcement of the first northern section of the dike was 
completed. Boskalis is actively involved in the National Flood 
Protection Program and is currently also working on the planning 
phase of a major dike reinforcement and river widening project – 
Meanderende Maas – in the province of North Brabant.
Work was also executed at various locations around the Netherlands 
to strengthen many other dikes. The coastlines of North Holland 
(Bergen) and Texel, Vlieland and Ameland in the Wadden Islands 
were also maintained and strengthened.
In January 2023, Boskalis was awarded the contract to further 
develop climate-resilient infrastructure on the island of Gulhifalhu in 
the Maldives. Gulhifalhu lies around four kilometers to the west of the 
Maldives’ capital, Malé. Its development is part of the Ministry of 
National Planning, Housing and Infrastructure’s plans to improve the 
port infrastructure, relieve the overcrowded capital and make this part 
of the Maldives resilient to coastal erosion.
Boskalis’ work, which serves as a climate-adaptive solution, will also 
make this part of the Maldives more resilient to rising sea levels. In this 
second phase of the island’s expansion, not only is new land being 
reclaimed but subsequent rock revetment work will also be completed 
to protect the shoreline.
Boskalis has successfully executed several climate-adaptive dredging 
and land reclamation projects in the Maldives, including reconstruction 
work on the islands of Vilufushi and Villingili following the devastating 
tsunami in late 2004 and the initial development of Gulhifalhu in 
2010 and 2012. Boskalis also successfully executed the first phase of 
the expansion of Gulhifalhu in 2019 and 2020.
In Singapore, the first polder in the region is being realized by 
Boskalis – “creating climate change resilient land below sea level”. 
The project includes several innovations with the highest standards in 
terms of flood protection and water management. These innovations 
provide valuable knowledge that can be used in the development of 
new polders elsewhere.

In 2023 Boskalis completed the protection and 
replenishment of more than 40 kilometers of 
coastline across eastern Togo and western Benin in 
West Africa. The coastline had suffered from 
significant erosion, resulting in coastal retreat that 
threatened vital infrastructure and the livelihoods and 
food security of the local population. A beach 
replenishment program was completed using more 
than one million cubic meters of sand. Meanwhile, 
on the Benin side of the border, a 6.4 million cubic 
meter sand engine was constructed - a concept 
co-developed by Boskalis and successfully applied in 
the Netherlands over the past decade.

CONNECTING  
THE SDGS 
At Boskalis our purpose is to create 
and protect prosperity and advance 
the energy transition. Through our 
strategy and responsible business 
practices, we contribute to the UN 
Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) which form the blueprint to 
achieve a better and more sustainable 
future for our planet. 
In 2015, the United Nations developed 17 SDGs comprising a common set of 
17 goals and 169 sub-targets. The goals call for worldwide action among 
governments, business and civil society to end poverty, ensure prosperity for all 
and protect the planet. We aim to help realize these goals where we can through 
our business. 
To identify which SDGs are most relevant to our activities and where Boskalis has 
the most to contribute, we completed an SDG assessment using the approach of 
the SDG Compass, a guide for business action developed by the Global Reporting 
Initiative, the UN Global Compact and the World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development. In line with this approach, we determined the extent to which we 
can contribute to the SDGs and the risks and opportunities they present throughout 
our value chain. This included assessing the impact our activities could have on 
the SDGs and rating our contribution to each of the 169 sub-targets. As a result, 
five SDGs have been identified as being most relevant to Boskalis: 
SDG 7:  Affordable and Clean Energy 
SDG 8:  Decent Work and Economic Growth 
SDG 9:  Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure 
SDG 13:  Climate Action 
SDG 14:  Life Below Water

Page 25:
MAPPING OUR SDG CONTRIBUTION BY REVENUE 
For the purposes of measuring and reporting our contribution we 
mapped the relevant proportion of Boskalis’ revenue against the 
SDGs indicated. Based on this exercise, around 80% of our business 
activities contribute directly to one of four SDGs, thereby supporting 
the aims of either SDGs 7, 9, 13 or 14. In addition to these SDGs that 
are directly linked to our activities, we also contribute to SDG 8 
represented by a total Group revenue of EUR 4.3 billion and our total 
employee base. 
Boskalis plays an important role in advancing SDG 8 through our 
contribution to an economy and the creation of jobs – directly and 
indirectly – through our projects and the supply chain. According to 
the International Labour Organization, the foundation of contributing 
to SDG 8 is that the work and jobs created are productive and deliver 
a fair income, provide safety and security, offer prospects for 
development, allow freedom of expression and organization and 
equal opportunities and treatment for men and women. 
We pride ourselves on being a good employer, offering opportunities 
for our employees to develop and grow. In line with our efforts to 
attract and retain employees, we are focusing more on the long-term 
retention of project-based personnel. We often attract local employees 
for the duration of a project. In an attempt to retain these employees, 
to build on their expertise and offer them growth potential, we are 
looking to expand our international operational pool. 
We are committed to our human rights and labor principles as a 
fundamental part of the way we do business. We promote the same 
principles in our relationships with clients and other business partners 
and apply the Suppliers Code of Conduct to our suppliers. 
In mapping our positive impact through revenue, we recognize that 
managing negative impacts of our operations on the SDGs is equally 
important in our sustainability journey. We describe the work we are 
doing on this in more detail in other sections of this report.
We contribute through 
projects and services 
primarily related to adaptive 
measures against climate 
change such as protection 
of land from flooding, sea 
defenses, development of 
polders and dike-related 
activities 
In 2023, these accounted 
for approximately 7% of 
Group revenue
We contribute through 
projects and services 
primarily related to the 
salvaging of vessels and 
associated pollution 
prevention
In 2023, these accounted

Group revenue
Projects frequently contribute to multiple SDGs, however, in the revenue allocation to the above SDGs, a project was attributed to only one SDG.  
The revenue for a project is therefore not counted double or split over more than one of these SDGs.
We contribute through 
projects and services 
that are pivotal to the 
maintenance and/or 
development of maritime 
infrastructure such as ports, 
land reclamation for 
society and inland infra 
such as road-related 
developments 
In 2023, these accounted 
for approximately 38% of 
Group revenue
 
We contribute through 
offshore wind energy 
projects that help advance 
the energy transition, 
(natural) gas projects as 
part of the transition and

  Completed transformation of the Bokalift 2 
with installation of an advanced Motion 
Compensated Pile Gripper Frame
  Executed the fourth edition of our 
WaveJump Innovation Challenge 
Besides our craftsmanship and longstanding experience in the maritime industry, 
Boskalis’ strength lies in its capacity for innovation that centers on the continuous 
development of modern and efficient equipment and groundbreaking work 
methods. As an organization we are constantly challenged by our clients to 
realize unique projects on a global scale, while by the same measure we seek to 
stretch our clients’ ambitions by offering new and innovative solutions. We aim to 
create business value through the successful implementation of knowledge and 
creative ideas that improve operational efficiency, reduce risk and develop 
sustainable solutions for our markets.
INNOVATIVE EQUIPMENT
One of Boskalis’ key qualities is its innovative ability to develop assets and 
equipment that extend our capabilities, incorporate efficiencies and help limit our 
impact on the environment. A key area of focus is the expansion and modification 
of our Offshore fleet to meet the growing demands and complexities of the 
offshore renewables market. At the same time we actively seek opportunities to 
design, trial and adopt technologies on our vessels that support our own transition 
away from fossil fuels to using cleaner sources of energy. 
MODIFYING THE BOKALIFT 2 
In May 2023, we completed the transformation of the Bokalift 2 in Schiedam, 
the Netherlands. Under our own management and direction, the vessel has been 
converted over four years from a drilling vessel to a modern groundbreaking crane 
vessel that is highly suited for the offshore wind market. As the final part of this 
transformation, an advanced Motion Compensated Pile Gripper Frame was 
installed. The new tool works in tandem with the Upending Hinge that was 
installed in late 2022 and is used to turn the monopile from a horizontal to 
a vertical position. The gripper frame ensures that monopile foundations with a 
length of more than 100 meters are vertically stationary during piling. The new 
tool can grip monopiles with a diameter of up to 12 meters, which also makes it 
suitable for the next generation of wind turbines. 
NEW ‘METHANOL-READY’ TRAILING SUCTION HOPPER DREDGER ON ORDER
Following an extensive in-house design process, in October 2023 Boskalis 
announced the order of a large state-of-the-art trailing suction hopper dredger that 
will be fully equipped to run on methanol as an alternative fuel. The vessel will 
have a hopper capacity of 31,000 m3 and will be built by the Dutch shipbuilding 
company Royal IHC over the next few years.
The new vessel will be one of the largest trailing suction hopper dredgers in the 
Boskalis fleet. Its dual fuel main engines will be equipped with two-stage turbos 
that can be powered by both conventional fuels and more sustainable alternatives 
such as biodiesel and methanol. The vessel will also be fitted with an onboard 
methanol plant and storage tanks that enable a switch to 100% methanol fuel, 
marking a significant step in making Boskalis’ dredging fleet more sustainable. 
With its many technological innovations, the vessel will be highly efficient and 
will make a significant contribution to reducing our carbon dioxide emissions. 
Other notable features of the energy-efficient vessel design include the full diesel-
electric installation and propulsion via Azipods™. These technological innovations, 
24


Page 27:
combined with the optimized underwater hull design and an 
advanced automation system, will contribute to a considerably lower 
fuel consumption.
With a double suction pipe equipped with underwater pumps and 
two discharge pumps with a combined discharge capacity of 
15,000 kW, the new trailing suction hopper dredger is well suited 
to dredging material and discharging over long distances to a 
reclamation site. This powerful performance also contributes to the 
increased efficiency of the dredging process.
WORKING METHODS
As a project organization, we distinguish ourselves through our 
ability to manage complexity and devise solutions to challenging 
problems. Our expert multidisciplinary teams design and plan 
projects through the application of innovative techniques and 
working methods, as well as with the support of advanced prediction 
models and monitoring systems. Our approach is characterized by a 
set of connected and interdependent phases. These include: design 
optimization based on the functional requirements of the end product; 
value engineering in which we save costs and add value by further 
iterating on our clients’ design; and tailoring our work methods to 
meet milestones, increase efficiencies and reduce impacts.
We also develop and deploy a range of data and digital technologies 
that can support our operations, create efficiencies and manage risks. 
Data-driven decision support and prediction modelling offer our 
teams valuable insight into ways to reduce project durations, for 
example by improving asset deployment efficiency and enhancing 
performance. 
LOGISTICS SIMULATION SOFTWARE
During the last year, we have implemented our own software that 
enables us to run project simulations to monitor and plan for the 
impact of interruptions to our operations. These may come about due 
to equipment breakdowns or poor weather conditions. The software 
supports stronger risk management by helping to determine the 
knock-on effects of these interruptions. The platform has been 
implemented on projects within our Offshore Heavy Lifting department 
which requires a complex logistical chain of vessels and equipment, 
particularly for the installation of wind farm foundations offshore. 
It is also currently being trialed across the Dredging & Inland Infra 
division. 
INNOVATION THROUGH CONTRACTS
Boskalis works with its clients through various innovative contract 
forms whereby we are actively involved in project development 
opportunities. Our project development team has extensive expertise 
in structuring complex infrastructure investments and enables us to 
pursue early-stage engagement on a range of global projects, often 
with local partners. At the same time we seek to forge partnerships 
through which Boskalis, its clients and partners can pool expertise and 
manage risk.
Boskalis’ early-stage involvement gives us greater influence to steer 
projects towards higher environmental and social standards and 
apply best practices for nature-based solutions initiatives. At the same 
time, we help our clients avoid delays and unforeseen costs caused 
by sequential and potentially time-consuming development and 
engineering processes. Where the development process is often 
characterized by investigating unknowns and changing circumstances, 
our approach brings a greater level of resilience, creating more 
sustainable client value and reducing the overall risk profile of the 
project. 
Boskalis has a strong relationship with multiple financial (development) 
institutions, including commercial banks, multilateral development 
banks, and credit insurance institutions. We recently collaborated 
with the Dutch impact development institution Invest International with 
whom we have developed an innovative financing package for a 
climate adaptive coastal protection project in Togo, West Africa (for 
more details of this project, see page 19). 
THE NETHERLANDS: MARKERMEER DIKES
Where project complexity demands more creative ways of working 
with clients, Boskalis is also a leader within the industry. We are 
currently working on a multi-year project to reinforce over 33 kilometers 
of dike around the Markermeer lake between the towns of Hoorn and 
Durgerdam north of Amsterdam. Due to the highly challenging 
technical scope and an uncertain regulatory environment around dike 
reinforcement on a cultural heritage site, we embraced the innovative 
concept of entering an alliance contract with our client, the Hollands 
Noorderkwartier district water board (HHNK). Under the contract, 
HHNK and Boskalis – together with its partners – are working together 
to design and construct the necessary reinforcements to the flood 
defenses.
The agreement enables both parties to evolve the project scope and 
manage risk as the end-product demands – important factors that 
stood in the way of a more traditional “design and construct” 
agreement. The alliance contract has enabled Boskalis’ early-stage 
involvement in the planning phase, bringing with it knock-on benefits 
for the local area. These include the incorporation of a new cycle path 
across the dike and the creation of a city beach as a leisure facility for 
the town’s residents within the project design.

WAVEJUMP INNOVATION 
CHALLENGE 
The winning team is presented with the trophy at 
this year’s WaveJump Innovation Challenge

Page 29:
During the year Boskalis ran the fourth edition of its WaveJump 
Innovation Challenge, an opportunity for employees to put forward 
and develop their own innovative ideas and designs. The initiative 
provides an accessible platform for entrepreneurship and to devise 
solutions to the challenges our teams face on projects. Successful 
ideas are then accelerated via the program to move from idea to pilot 
to ultimately become a valuable solution for the company.  
“By looking for ideas inside the organization, we aim to add value to 
Boskalis,” explains Sander Steenbrink, general manager of Research 
& Development. “Not only with the innovations themselves, but also 
through the entire process. Because the focus is also on sharing 
innovations, inspiring each other, establishing connections, and 
teamwork. All those elements combined make this an exciting 
program.”  
More than a hundred ideas were submitted and reviewed during the 
year, including many that tackled sustainability challenges facing the 
company. A shortlist of six went through the acceleration phase 
before the live pitch in the final round. The winning group presented 
the idea of developing a Prefabricated Vertical Drain from a natural, 
sustainable material. The idea was presented by two colleagues who 
are working as geotechnical engineers on the Pulau Tekong project 
in Singapore. 
The program is not only an excellent platform for employees to share 
their ideas, but also a means of bringing a more powerful offer to our 
clients, while helping us manage the impact of our work on the world 
around us. 
“At Boskalis we are very good at problem solving on projects,” 
says Steenbrink. “In WaveJump, however, we approach problems 
differently. We first look at the relevance and the target group: what 
can the idea deliver and what is the added value for Boskalis? We 
help teams by pointing them in the right direction. As important, we 
also teach them how to pitch the idea. You have to be able to put 
your idea into words convincingly in a short time and get people 
interested in your story.”

HUMAN  
EXCELLENCE 
Our people are considered our most important asset and a determining factor for 
our success. Our approach to human capital is therefore a key pillar of our 
business strategy and pivotal to our ability to achieve sustainable growth while 
managing the impact of our activities on our people and the world around us.
Under the Human Excellence pillar of our strategy, our objective is to strategically 
expand our workforce while fostering an environment in which employees feel 
both connected and engaged and can maximize their talents. To accomplish this, 
we prioritize effective leadership and empower employees to take control of their 
personal development, providing them with the necessary time and resources to 
enhance their performance and progress. There are five main cornerstones within 
Human Excellence: Performance & Development, Internal Mobility, Talent 
Sourcing, Vitality, and Diversity & Inclusion.
In 2023, we dedicated our efforts to further integrating Human Excellence 
within our organization. We organized monthly targeted events, workshops, and 
webinars as part of our talent development tools and processes, designed to raise 
awareness of and advance the objectives of this strategic pillar.
PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
To meet the challenges of an evolving commercial landscape and support our 
people in realizing their career ambitions, we delivered training programs and 
personal development opportunities across the company. The focus remains on 
equipping managers with the right skills to develop their teams, while providing all 
employees with the necessary knowledge to support sustained career progression. 
MANAGER ESSENTIALS
To support project leaders and first-time managers across the business, we 
launched the Manager Essentials program which helps participants develop their 
leadership style, acquire the necessary coaching skills, and build a strong network 
within the company. The training supports new leaders globally in developing and 
exerting personal influence for greater team engagement and accountability. 
Separate course components cover individual leadership qualities such as values, 
skills, leadership, and communication style, as well as team and situational 
leadership where participants explore themes such as trust, feedback, and the 
conditions for optimal team collaboration and performance. 
PROJECT PROFESSIONAL PROGRAM
This year we ran our Project Professional Program aimed at advancing high-
potential employees towards project management level. The program, which 
continues into 2024, builds skills in areas such as leadership, team development, 
strategy, and change management. Participants also gain knowledge from 
Boskalis experts about key components of a project including contract 
management, project finance and control, and stakeholder management.  
PROJECT MANAGEMENT LEADERSHIP PROGRAM
The Project Management Leadership Program is targeted at senior project 
managers in critical roles on large and medium-sized projects within the Dredging 
Ambition

& Inland Infra division. The program seeks to add structured learning 
to the long-term practical experience that characterizes this level of 
role, preparing project managers for more complex responsibilities. 
The training is tailored to the individual and takes place within a 
project environment, enabling practical application and an immediate 
return on the learning investment. 
PROJECT MANAGEMENT COMMUNITY
During the year we continued to forge active communities of project 
managers and directors within our Dredging & Inland Infra and 
Offshore Energy divisions. The communities consist of approximately 
50 project managers, including those from our home markets, and 
foster important levels of knowledge-sharing and peer-to-peer 
experience development. The communities support a need to meet the 
challenges of an evolving commercial landscape and increased 
competition. Relevant themes and practical examples are determined 
by the community members themselves.
INTERNAL MOBILITY
Engagement with our employees tells us internal mobility remains a 
valuable component within Human Excellence and an effective method 
to increase talent retention. During 2023, we sought to increase the 
support and guidance offered to employees around future career 
opportunities within Boskalis. In November we held our Navigate Your 
Career event to maintain our focus on the growth and development of 
employees while also encouraging them to take control of their own 
professional development.
Through various inspiring workshops, a career discussion with the 
CEO, and networking sessions in different departments, employees 
gained practical insights and advice about making their next steps 
within Boskalis. As part of efforts to prepare employees effectively, 
professional development workshops were delivered covering 
presentation and public speaking skills, working with artificial 
intelligence, and planning one’s career path. The event was held 
across the Papendrecht campus as well as in our offices in Singapore 
and Abu Dhabi. The majority of sessions were also accessible online.
TALENT SOURCING
Maximizing our ability to attract and retain the skills we need in a 
constrained labor market, remained a key challenge in 2023. A 
well-filled order book coupled with more complex projects necessitate 
the acquisition and retention of more sophisticated skill sets and 
strategic competencies – and in greater numbers – to expand our 
horizons and meet client requirements. 
Against this backdrop, in 2022 we established a new regional talent 
hub in Abu Dhabi which serves to attract and integrate talent from the 
Middle East and Asia regions. This gives us greater flexibility in 
delivering key business functions, as well as remote and operational 
project support. For further information please see pages 30 to 31.
During the year, our graduate recruitment focused on increasing our 
intake of talent with vocational training as opposed to those with a 
university degree. This approach seeks to feed an increased demand 
within the organization for the skillsets those with vocational training 
can offer – particularly within our Dredging & Inland Infra division 
and Fleet. At the same time, it enables Boskalis to tap into this young 
talent pool at an earlier stage in the career path, giving us an 
advantage in the tight labor market.  
VITALITY
Boskalis recognizes the prevalence of concerns related to mental 
health and stress within the workplace, particularly in a context where 
staff may spend prolonged periods on vessels or at project sites away 
from home. Last year we engaged a third party to conduct a validated 
survey with staff and run focus groups to discuss mental well-being 
and topics of concern within our Dredging activities. 
During 2023, four groups of managers in our Dredging and Offshore 
Energy divisions took part in a series of pilot workshops on 
“Recognizing and acknowledging stress”. Following an evaluation of 
the process, a toolkit will be rolled out in 2024 that seeks to create 
standardized interventions to create a common language and talk 
about work pressure and mental well-being within team environments.
Following last year’s success, in September 2023 we ran the second 
edition of the Boskalis Worldwide Vitality Challenge. More than 
1,000 employees across our global offices, vessels and project sites 
took part in the three-week initiative, joining organized sports events, 
webinars and competing to increase their daily step count via an 
interactive app. The focus was on having fun, building team morale, 
and connecting people across Boskalis locations within a sociable 
and active environment. On a practical level, the Challenge supported 
people to better incorporate their exercise routines and a healthier 
lifestyle within their busy work schedule. 
DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) was the focus of a designated section 
within Boskalis’ most recent employee engagement survey. Based on 
the survey findings, during 2023 we worked with a specialist 
consultancy to conduct off-site dialogue sessions with employees on 
social safety. 
The sessions sought to generate a deeper understanding of social 
safety issues and identify potential initiatives and avenues to increase 
awareness and understanding of the topic. The process has been 
guided by the D&I Taskforce which will assess the outcomes of the 
process in early 2024 ahead of next steps.

A NEW TALENT HUB  
IN ABU DHABI 
Our new office in Abu Dhabi has opened its doors to almost 
280 employees representing more than 20 nationalities
30


Page 33:
Boskalis has an orderbook filled with exciting projects around the 
world. To successfully execute these increasingly complex projects we 
continuously invest in new talent and the development of our people. 
As part of our efforts to ensure a supply of sufficient skills and 
competencies to meet our needs we have established a major new 
talent hub in Abu Dhabi.
This fast-growing hub was opened in 2022 and focuses on global 
talent acquisition and management in support of our projects, 
company departments and business units. It is built on the Boskalis 
culture focusing on entrepreneurship and individual development and 
already hosts several key departments, including Legal, ICT, Tendering 
and Engineering, Fleet Management, Financial Shared Services, 
and our Travel Desk. Each one operates as an integral part of their 
respective functions at our headquarters in the Netherlands: the talent 
hub is known within Boskalis as “Building 7” – a new ‘neighbor’ to 
the six buildings on our Papendrecht campus.
“We need talented people to fulfil all the ambitions that Boskalis has 
and to meet the needs of our clients globally,” explained Human 
Resources Director, Lodewijk Wijngaard. “This new hub gives us 
access to an enormous labor market: not just in the Middle East but 
also in Southeast Asia – two large regions where we work regularly.” 
We have taken a step-by-step approach to growing the office, 
carefully integrating our HR and training systems and extending 
flagship initiatives like Young Boskalis from the Netherlands. At 
year-end approximately 280 employees were on the Building 7 
payroll.
The office is an important building block within Human Excellence 
and our broader Sustainable Growth strategy. It helps to better meet 
specific project needs, particularly during the start-up phase. 
Knowledge, skills, experience and systems can be made immediately 
available, freeing up time for project managers and project teams. 
With more than 20 nationalities already represented, the hub brings 
together a range of talent and working cultures. Through this new 
base Boskalis is progressing its evolution from its historical roots in the 
Netherlands and Europe into a more diverse and multi-cultural 
organization that, in turn, supports our growth within emerging 
economies in the Middle East and Asia. 
“We wanted to create a base that makes Boskalis much stronger as a 
company,” explained Wijngaard. “Its international nature and the 
global experts within our team in Abu Dhabi – and the opportunities 
they bring – is a source of significant energy and motivation and will 
enable us to do that.”

HEALTH AND 
SAFETY 
NINA
Safety is our top priority in everything we do. We want to ensure that our people 
and the people we work with return home safely every day. To help us achieve 
this goal, more than a decade ago we developed our NINA (No Injuries, No 
Accidents) safety program. Thanks to the sustained commitment, our safety record 
has improved significantly over that period. Despite this positive trend, our 2023 
safety performance was marred by two fatal accidents that occurred within our 
operations. We express our sincere condolences to the respective families of our 
two colleagues. 
Under the leadership of the Board of Management we will invigorate the 
principles of our safety program in 2024. Based on an analysis of relevant safety 
data, including incident reports and lessons learned, we have identified a distinct 
set of further interventions to intensify the training provided to employees and 
subcontractors, with an emphasis on increasing safety knowledge and skills.  
We aim to do this through the enhancement of safety instructions and practices 
during projects and on board our vessels. Our plans for 2024 also include a 
detailed evaluation of current safety trainings and onboarding processes to 
determine essential safety knowledge for specific roles. We will also ensure levels 
of operational safety support that help to better identify risks and any non-
compliance as the first steps towards more effective mitigation measures. 
POLICY FRAMEWORK
Under our Human Rights and Labor Policy we take care of the safety, security 
and health of everyone involved in our activities. We show our commitment to 
prevent accidents. Boskalis offers, promotes and continuously improves safe 
and healthy working conditions through the NINA safety behavior program. 
All of our employees and subcontractors working under our supervision are 
covered by our health and safety management system which conforms to the 
ISO 45001 standard. The policy is reviewed every two years and its 
implementation is monitored through quarterly reports to the Board of 
Management. The policy is publicly available on our website and shared 
directly with relevant stakeholders.
NINA, OUR BEHAVIOR-BASED SAFETY PROGRAM 
NINA consists of two main pillars: values and rules. As such, the program 
develops people’s awareness of their own responsibility towards safety and 
stimulates a working environment in which safety responsibilities and potentially 
hazardous situations are both discussed openly and reported. 
Over the year we registered a Total Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR) of 0.30 while 
our Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIF) was 0.03. For further details of our 
safety performance under the NINA program please see page 65. 
NINA is embedded across the organization in the form of safety ‘moments’ at 
the beginning of meetings, safety references as part of regular division and 
group communications, and structured training on the rules, values and safety 
communication of the program. Safety must remain foremost in people’s minds 
through regular staff engagement activities and training at all levels. This year 
some 4,000 employees participated in different types of safety awareness 
Ambition

training. The focus on values and behavior is intended to be long-
lasting in addition to being rule-driven. 
Our NINA program is most evident in our operations. At the start of 
a project, employees, subcontractors and client representatives receive 
a site-specific safety training, an interactive NINA induction session, 
and a NINA start-up, challenging everyone to think about the health 
and safety risks associated with that project. On longer projects there 
are refresher and reflection sessions, and NINA Workboxes are 
introduced on different topics where there is a need. Our NINA 
trainers travel regularly to projects all over the world to ensure the 
program is embedded throughout our operations and our NINA tools 
are available in more than 20 languages.
We target a Lost Time Injury Frequency and Total Recordable Incident 
Rate of zero. Our safety targets are set by the Board of Management 
in consultation with the Director of Safety, Health, Environment and 
Quality (SHE-Q). The Director SHE-Q reports directly to the CEO, 
while the Board of Management engages directly with the workforce 
on health and safety matters in several ways, including site visits to 
projects and vessels, the quarterly internal reporting process, via the 
Works Council and the periodic employee engagement survey (most 
recently completed in 2022). 
STRENGTHENING SAFETY LEADERSHIP
In 2023 we continued the roll out of our safety leadership training, 
known as The Expedition. The aim of the training is to strengthen our 
safety culture through developing safety leadership skills and using our 
leaders’ full potential to increase safety risk awareness. The training is 
run over six months and enables teams and individuals to develop 
their safety leadership skills in two key areas: supporting long-term 
teambuilding around safety issues and helping team members to 
maintain responsibility for their own and one another’s safety within 
the project environment. The training has been run across our 
business, on projects within all divisions, as well as with colleagues 
in Fleet Management and on board our vessels. During 2023, more 
than 500 people participated in the program. In 2024, we will 
complete an evaluation of the training’s impact on the safety culture 
within the company. 
NINA WORKBOX SERIES
During the year we increased the number and frequency of NINA 
Workboxes delivered among our operational teams. The NINA 
Workbox Series is a practical tool that emphasizes the risks and 
dangers that contribute to certain injuries or are associated with 
specific activities, giving greater depth to the NINA rules. 
The content of the workboxes is based largely on the lessons that can 
be learned from reported accidents and near misses, with the relevant 
information brought back to the organization and put to practical use. 
The workboxes focus either on “Safe Body”, such as protecting hands 
and preventing trips and falls, or “Safe Practices”, including handling 
equipment or mooring a vessel. Every workbox consists of a group 
meeting designed to further increase awareness on a particular theme 
by means of an open dialogue and a practical assignment.
The Hands Workbox was the most frequently run in 2023 with 87 
sessions completed on vessels and projects during the year. Further 
workboxes in this series include Mooring & Unmooring and Lifting & 
Hoisting. To further increase safety knowledge and tackle specific 
risks, we plan to develop “Head & Eyes” and “Heavy Equipment” 
workboxes in 2024.
DO-IT WORKSHOPS
The focus of these workshops is on raising awareness of NINA and 
its key principles by establishing channels of open communication to 
both give and receive feedback on safety matters. The workshops are 
targeted at operational staff on vessels, at site offices and on projects. 
During the year more than 150 workshops were held and the training 
was completed by approximately 1,200 employees and contractors.
SAFETY HAZARD OBSERVATION CARDS
To actively work towards creating a safer daily working environment 
our people are encouraged to report hazardous situations using our 
Safety Hazard Observation Cards (SHOCs) system. Our SHOC 
reporting and data analysis platform supports a proactive approach 
to accident prevention by enabling users to track their reports, include 
their own safety suggestions, and record positive safety behavior. 
Meanwhile, users of the web app and dashboard can determine 
behavioral trends and safety statistics across projects.

EMISSIONS 
In line with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, we are committed to achieving 
climate neutrality across our global operations by 2050. Our goal is to reduce 
emissions and gain a competitive advantage by offering accessible, low-carbon 
solutions to our clients.
The pace at which we move towards our emission-reduction targets depends on 
the opportunities and technology available to different parts of the company. It is 
important to differentiate between areas where we have direct control and 
significant influence over reductions – such as in our onshore operations where we 
have adopted numerous measures to progress the switch to clean sources of 
energy – and where our influence is indirect or reliant on the progress made by 
third parties. Our largest contribution to greenhouse gas emissions comes from our 
vessels. To achieve substantial emission reductions within the fleet we are 
dependent not only on suitable alternatives to fossil fuels, but also their availability 
and the necessary infrastructure to serve our global maritime operations. 
During 2023, we made good progress on our emission reduction efforts and 
completed a study into how we can measure and monitor our progress towards 
net zero by 2050. We support the net zero 2050 transition pathway for 
international shipping set by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in July 
2023. This industry pathway includes a mid-term reduction ambition to reduce 
carbon intensity by 2030. In line with this pathway, we aim to achieve a 10% 
reduction in carbon intensity relative to 2023 through several energy efficiency 
measures and the use of renewable fuels. A carbon intensity ratio, developed 
in-house, which is in line with the IMO intensity ratio will allow us to monitor 
progress against our ambition and track the energy efficiency of our vessels. This 
ratio expresses the emissions relative to the utilized installed power of a vessel.
OUR FLEET
In 2023, our vessels accounted for around 99% of our Scope 1 and 2 carbon 
dioxide footprint – this amounted to 1.33 million MT. For full details on our 2023 
carbon dioxide emissions please see page 60. 
Over recent years we have adopted a range of operational measures and new 
technologies to reduce emissions from our fleet. We continue to pilot and expand 
these initiatives in support of further reductions.
Powerpacks: We are currently in the process of retrofitting numerous offshore 
vessels through Energy Storage Systems. These “power packs” will reduce the 
vessels’ fuel consumption and associated carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide 
emissions by an average of up to 20% during DP operations. They also provide a 
power supply and energy storage facility while the vessels are moored.
Emission dashboards: The development of onboard and remote emission 
dashboards improves crews’ awareness of operational efficiencies and helps 
them conserve fuel. For certain conditions, operational and technical efficiencies 
based on data from the dashboards can lead to a reduction in fuel consumption 
of more than 5%.
Maintenance: During 2023 we piloted a maintenance program with an engine 
manufacturer to determine the optimum maintenance schedule from the point of

view of reducing fuel consumption. We will implement the program 
from early 2024, starting with two of our trailing suction hopper 
dredgers.
Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems: SCRs can reduce the level 
of nitrogen oxide in exhaust gases by up to 90%. In 2023, the 
Strandway became the third hopper dredger to be fitted with a SCR.
Drag reduction measures: Various measures are applied to increase 
fuel efficiency. In 2023 these included the use of alternative hull 
coatings, frequent hull cleaning, limiting volumes of water ballast in 
our vessels and/or optimizing the trim, and polishing propellers. 
Alternative energy sources are also an important means to reduce 
emissions and to transition away from fossil fuels. In 2023, we were 
successful in applying clean or renewable energy in a number of 
areas.
Biofuels: Where possible, Boskalis enables its clients to opt for ‘light’, 
drop-in biofuel to thereby reduce carbon emissions on projects.
Shore power: In late 2023 Boskalis commissioned a large-scale shore 
power facility at its premises in the Waalhaven in Rotterdam where its 
vessels are (de)mobilized for projects. Moored vessels will now switch 
off their diesel-powered generators and use green shore power, 
resulting in an annual reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of 1,600 
tons. The facility also contributes significantly to improving air quality 
by reducing particulate matter and nitrogen oxide emissions.
Renewable fuels: The development of suitable alternative fuels – and 
the expertise and technology necessary for the international maritime 
industry to complete its energy transition – relies on collaborations with 
our industry peers, knowledge institutions, and other partners. Through 
this approach, we are participants in several initiatives investigating 
the viability of renewable fuels – including methanol, ammonia, and 
hydrogen – as well as testing these fuels with leading maritime engine 
manufacturers. In 2023 we executed a pilot project with our maritime 
partners to conduct dredging activities with a vessel fueled entirely by 
hydrogen. For further information on this, please refer to page 37.
ONSHORE EQUIPMENT 
The vast majority of our dry earthmoving activities (Inland Infra) are 
conducted in the Netherlands. During 2023 we continued to invest in 
low-emission equipment in support of our ambitions for all 
onshore projects in the Netherlands to become climate neutral by 
2030. In line with this ambition, in 2023 a detailed investment plan 
was put together aimed at clean fuel alternatives.
In 2023, we invested in electric equipment such as excavators and 
earthmoving trucks, while existing machinery has been converted from 
traditional fuels to electric. We also purchased an Energy Storage 
System that can be deployed to different projects to charge our 
equipment, thereby retaining charging options – and the necessary 
flexibility – in-house.
Since 2012, our operations in the Netherlands have been certified  
as Level 5 (the best level) on the so-called ‘CO2 Performance Ladder  
of the Foundation for Climate Friendly Procurement and Business’ 
(SKAO). This ranking system is used by Dutch government agencies 
and businesses to recognize performance in the areas of energy and 
materials efficiency.
COMMERCIAL OFFERINGS
Wherever possible, we help our clients to adopt sustainable and 
low-carbon solutions. Our approach focuses on two key strategies: 
the use of low-carbon energy sources such as biofuels or, where 
available, renewable electricity for powering our equipment; and the 
optimization of project designs to reduce energy and materials used.
On successful tenders we collaborate with our clients from the earliest 
possible stage, ideally during the project’s design phase. Together, we 
develop a sustainability plan that shapes the project scope and work 
practices, ensuring that it aligns with our shared objectives. This joint 
plan serves to minimize emissions throughout the construction phase 
and the facility’s lifespan. 
COMMUTING, WAREHOUSES AND OFFICES 
To reduce our emissions associated with commuting, we encourage 
the use of public transport to our head office in Papendrecht by 
offering a regular shuttle service – by electric minibus – from the local 
train station. We have also adopted broader measures – through 
company policy and the provision of more than 250 charging points 
– to reduce our emissions from car commuting and accelerate the 
take-up of (plug-in hybrid) electric vehicles among our workforce.
We have also installed solar panels at several of our premises and in 
2023 added panels on buildings at our headquarters in Papendrecht 
and in Capelle aan den IJssel. Our facilities in the Netherlands 
resulted in the generation of 1,923 MW of renewable electricity 
during 2023. We have also prioritized the energy efficiency of our 
buildings and offset all electricity we purchase in the Netherlands with 
Dutch Biomass NTA 8080 certificates, thereby neutralizing the 
associated Scope 2 emissions. 
Within our sphere of influence and where we have direct control to do 
so, we continue to take steps to further reduce our carbon footprint. 
Meanwhile, as the technologies and clean fuels required by the 
maritime sector continue to be developed, we are exerting our 
influence and contributing valuable resources to our industry’s energy 
transition.

To progress towards its climate neutral ambition, Boskalis aims to 
increase the energy efficiency of its fleet and its use of renewable 
fuels. However, completing our energy transition relies on the 
development of suitable fuels that can not only meet the energy 
intensity demanded by our vessels but also satisfy broader practical 
considerations such as storage capacity and the highest safety 
standards. 
During 2023, Boskalis carried out a successful pilot project that 
demonstrated the ability of one of its vessels to run on hydrogen and 
conduct dredging activities completely emission-free. The Medusa 2 
– a converted excavator pontoon – was fitted with two interconnected 
containers, one containing hydrogen and the other a fuel cell that 
converts the hydrogen into electrical energy. That energy was then 
used to power an electric crane on board. Running solely on hydrogen, 
the Medusa 2 conducted dredging activities on Maasvlakte 2 in the 
port of Rotterdam for several weeks.  
The pilot yielded valuable information about what it means for a 
vessel to operate on hydrogen and the possible implications if 
applied more broadly within Boskalis and the industry. Data gathered 
from the pilot can be compared with similar work executed with 
diesel-powered cranes. Meanwhile, sharing the outcomes and 
acquired knowledge enables our industry as a whole to progress its 
transition to cleaner fuels. 
The pilot demonstrated not just that a vessel of this kind could be 
powered by a hydrogen-powered fuel cell but, crucially, that the 
renewable fuel could support a crane’s extreme variation in power 
demand during dredging operations. The pilot also identified 
important limitations, such as the vast quantities of hydrogen required 
to power the vessel and therefore the importance of infrastructure to 
refuel. A single 20-foot container of hydrogen was enough for around 
three days of dredging. Operations also depend on a suitable 
location where hydrogen can be loaded effectively and safely. 
The pilot was carried out in collaboration with the Port of Rotterdam 
and ZEDhub which brings together dredging companies, energy 
providers, engine manufacturers and fuel-cell distributors who all play 
a role in the maritime industry’s energy transition.

BIODIVERSITY 
In December 2022 the Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) was adopted by 
the UN Biodiversity Conference which set a number of targets to reverse 
biodiversity loss and restore damaged ecosystems on land and at sea. In line 
with OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the protection of biodiversity 
and the marine environment are central to Boskalis’ environmental and social 
risk management policies and procedures. 
Where our activities occur close to critical habitats or sensitive ecosystems, we 
apply systematic precautionary management and mitigation measures. We 
invest in research and development, ways of working and collaboration with 
third party experts to help protect and enhance biodiversity and marine life. 
Depending on location and the type of work, our activities can have an impact 
on individual species as well as the broader habitat. The most significant 
biodiversity pressures related to our business are reflected in our Biodiversity 
Framework. 
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT MEASURES 
In line with the mitigation hierarchy, we aim to prevent, reduce or mitigate any 
negative biodiversity impacts related to our operations. During the preparatory 
phase, as well as throughout a project’s implementation, we plan, adapt and 
optimize our working methods to align with the environmental sensitivities 
associated with the local situation. We apply our Environmental and Social 
Policy (see page 42) as well as the relevant industry and international standards 
to manage biodiversity risks effectively. 
Environmental training and management systems: in addition to 14001 ISO 
certification across our business units (see page 64), we organize environmental 
awareness training to ensure compliance with pollution prevention methods such 
as IMO MARPOL waste regulations, oil spill prevention, antifouling measures 
and sewage management. We embed our environmental management approach 
within our Way of Working quality management system. 
Enhance environmental opportunities with nature-based solutions: on certain 
projects we can incorporate sustainable design solutions from the earliest 
(tender) stage. These include engaging with our partners and other 
environmental, design or engineering specialists to create cost-efficient solutions 
that not only mitigate the biodiversity risk and impact of the project but also 
serve to protect and enhance the local habitat or ecosystem.  
Technological innovation: we continue to invest in research to bring leading-edge 
solutions to clients seeking an environmentally sustainable project or nature-
inclusive designs. Together with our partners, we have brought several solutions 
to market. These include: modular artificial reefs, large-scale oyster reefs as 
nature enhancements for offshore projects, a seagrass transplanter system and 
green valves for our hopper dredgers.  
Evaluation of environmental risks: the approach we take to managing potential 
environmental impact is in line with our Environmental and Social (E&S) Policy, 
which aligns with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Each 
project is subject to a two-stage assessment process whereby we study the 
situation and local environmental sensitivities and determine the project-related

E&S Impact Scan and E&S Review please see page 42. 
Optimize our work method: we design a work method that meets the 
environmental requirements of a given project and establish a relevant 
Environmental Monitoring and Management Plan (EMMP).  
Adaptive management: during project implementation we monitor our 
environmental performance using in situ measurements and ecosystem 
receptor responses. We adapt and optimize our working methods as 
necessary to prevent, reduce or mitigate environmental impacts and to 
ensure compliance with all relevant regulation.  
Ballast water management: vessels comply with the IMO Ballast  
Water Management Convention which aims to minimize the spread  
of invasive species.
NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS
Solutions that harness nature can provide answers to countless global 
sustainable development challenges, from the environment to the 
economy and society at large. The GBF requires the restoration and 
sustainable use of natural ecosystems. Through the provision of 
nature-based infrastructure, as well as the delivery of restoration 
projects such as De Wieden (see pages 40 to 41), Boskalis is well-
equipped to deliver the sustainable, cost-effective and resilient 
solutions that are needed.
We continue to invest in the development of new technologies and 
work methods and to build an environmental mindset with our teams, 
project owners and stakeholders. One of the ways we do this is 
through our investment in the Ecoshape Foundation which executes the 
Building with Nature program, an innovative approach to hydraulic 
engineering that takes the dynamics of natural systems as the point of 
departure in its project design. Ecoshape is recognized by multilaterals 
such as the UN and World Bank as an expert on nature-based 
solutions and has become an enabler for such projects on the 
international stage. 
BOSKALIS BIODIVERSITY FRAMEWORK 
Our Biodiversity Framework is based on our collaboration with an 
international NGO and detailed work within the business to identify 
our priorities and areas of influence in the field of biodiversity. It is our 
ambition to prevent, reduce or mitigate negative biodiversity impacts 
related to our operations and to lead the industry in the development 
of nature-based solutions to protect and enhance coastal ecosystems. 
We aim to translate our biodiversity ambition into our operations 
across five key areas and associated objectives. The framework and 
an explanation of the priority areas can be found on our website.
During 2023 the Sustainability Department began a process to log 
and analyse current activities under our Framework across both our 
Dredging and Offshore Energy divisions as a first step towards 
developing more structured actions and measurable indicators 
regarding our impacts on biodiversity. This step will enable Boskalis to 
adopt a more holistic approach to managing impacts, further embed 
its offerings around nature-inclusive design and nature-based solutions, 
and better communicate its performance on biodiversity topics to its 
stakeholders.
MEASURABLE DATA INDICATORS 
We have identified two priority areas of our framework – turbidity 
and pollution – that present a potential negative impact on biodiversity 
and have sought to devise meaningful and comparable units of 
measurement to better monitor our performance on these topics. 
In 2023 our assessment of turbidity demonstrated that, of the projects 
carried out that contained a turbidity scope, there were zero turbidity 
exceedances that resulted in operational downtime. 
Our assessment of the priority area of pollution focused on measuring 
our performance against our target of achieving zero oil spills across 
our operations. During 2023, we recorded two spills; one spill 
involved biodegradable oil and therefore had limited impact on the 
marine environment. The second spill – of approximately 200 liters of 
marine gas oil – occurred while a vessel was bunkering in adverse 
weather conditions.

NATURE CONSERVATION

Page 43:
To address some of the biodiversity and climate challenges of the 
modern era, three years ago Boskalis established a service line that 
focuses solely on important habitat restoration projects in the 
Netherlands.  
“Boskalis Natuurbouw” helps both public authorities and non-
governmental bodies realize construction projects whose primary 
purpose is to enhance nature conservation and stem the problem of 
biodiversity decline. At the same time, these generally smaller-scale 
projects help Boskalis to develop more innovative work methods that 
can be applied across the company and also generate circular 
resources such as sand and soils for use on other projects.  
De Wieden – the largest lowland marsh in Northwestern Europe – is 
a nature conservation project in the Dutch province of Overijssel that 
falls under the Natuurbouw banner. Several plant and animal species 
within this nature reserve are under pressure due to the loss or 
deterioration of the local habitat. In line with the objectives of the 
European Union’s Natura 2000, the province of Overijssel is striving 
to restore these habitats and boost the numbers of several rare species, 
including the large fire butterfly and the corn crake and marshland 
birds such as the bittern, spotted crake and great reed warbler.  
To accomplish this, a team of in-house Boskalis ecologists are using 
various techniques. These include widening waterways, constructing 
embankments for higher ground and barriers to regulate water 
flows, and creating more gradual transitions between areas of water 
and land.  
Working with heavy equipment within a protected nature reserve 
presents a number of challenges. Scheduling has therefore taken 
account of the rare flora and fauna that are present and has been 
carefully planned around the birds’ breeding seasons. For their own 
protection, certain species of fish were captured and temporarily 
relocated before work began.  
We also use large steel plates to protect the marshland during 
excavation works and the transportation of material. Since much of 
the wildlife is sensitive to nitrogen – a factor that has contributed to 
the biodiversity decline – it is vital that we limit our own emissions 
during the project. An electric excavator has been deployed to 
minimize nitrogen oxide and carbon emissions while other equipment 
is run on biofuels.

COMMUNITY  
IMPACT 
The majority of our work takes place offshore, however, our operations can 
impact local communities at the coast or inland. This impact may be either 
positive – through the direct creation of jobs and infrastructure that offers 
opportunities for trade and economic growth – or, potentially, negative, through 
disturbance or changes to the local environment. Given the defined services we 
are contracted to provide for our client or the temporary nature of our presence 
in a specific location, we may be limited in the scope we have to meaningfully 
engage with the local community. It can also be hard to create and measure 
long-term impact. Wherever possible we enhance the positive impact and 
mitigate or offset any negative outcomes of our work. Opportunities and risks 
that may be associated with our activities include:
  disturbance as a result of logistics and transportation; 
  supply chain workforce welfare and human rights;
  impact on local livelihoods, indigenous peoples or cultural heritage; 
  local job creation; 
  training and education of the local workforce.  
The approach we take to managing potential social impact is in line with 
our Environmental and Social Policy, which aligns with the principles of the 
International Labour Organization and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational 
Enterprises. Each project is subject to a two-stage assessment process as 
follows: 
The Environmental & Social (E&S) Impact Scan enables us to apply a consistent 
approach to E&S management and thereby identify the projects that need our 
attention. The Scan was last updated in 2023 to cover a broader set of E&S risks 
and opportunities and project requirements to better support early engagement 
with our clients and the incorporation of the outcomes within the project process. 
The Scan is part of our ISO 9001 quality management system, the Way of 
Working, and supports the early recognition of environmental and social risks 
and opportunities associated with our intended designs and activities. By 
conducting the Scan at the beginning of the tender phase or at an early stage in 
a project’s development, we can more effectively incorporate the findings into the 
project process as well as improve allocation of specific resources and expertise.  
The Environmental & Social Review process standardizes the way we review 
environmental and social risks and opportunities in projects, once they have 
been highlighted by the E&S Impact Scan. The process structures requirements, 
risks and opportunities based on the IFC Performance Standards framework. 
This way Boskalis is better able to systematically review environmental and social 
requirements and prioritize and address potential environmental and social risks 
and opportunities. 
In some cases our work is a small part of a larger project scope that has 
wider-reaching social impacts. As a contractor this can present a dilemma as we 
may have limited influence over our client or the local social or political context. 
In these situations we work in line with the principles set out by the OECD 
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, exerting leverage to encourage social 
impact management practices in the chain. There are five areas to our social 
impact approach: 
 
42


Page 45:
SOCIAL RISK & OPPORTUNITY ASSESSMENT 
We aim for the early identification of social risks and opportunities 
as part of our standard risk and opportunities approach. This helps us 
to create the necessary awareness and support an effective social 
management strategy at the project level.  
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Depending on the local stakeholder landscape, we develop a 
stakeholder management plan that may include on-site community 
liaison officers to engage with local communities and support 
stakeholder consultation processes.  
GRIEVANCE MANAGEMENT
Boskalis strives for open and clear communication with our various 
external stakeholders and is open to suggestions, ideas, complaints, 
grievances and criticism. The Grievance Policy describes how we 
offer our external stakeholders the possibility to bring forward any 
grievance without the risk of any retaliation. Grievances may be 
treated on a confidential basis upon request and can be made 
anonymously on a 24/7 basis. At project level, Boskalis frequently 
offers a targeted local grievance mechanism to ensure transparency 
and engagement with our local stakeholders. Such grievance 
mechanisms are based on the Grievance Policy.  
COMMUNITY CONTRIBUTION AND LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
We recognize our ability to stimulate positive community impacts 
through local job creation, local procurement, skills development and 
training, as well as the benefits of the new infrastructure that we 
create. Where possible, we seek to benefit communities by 
maximizing these elements in our projects and through measures 
such as capacity-building and skills transfer we also help create 
opportunities for the community in the longer term. 
COMMUNITY WELFARE AND HEALTH AND SAFETY
Our human rights and labor principles are a fundamental part of 
the way we do business. Through our safety behavior program, 
No Injuries, No Accidents (NINA) we take care of the safety, security 
and health of everyone involved in our activities. 
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL AWARENESS 
In order to increase awareness and engagement on social and 
environmental impact we run various targeted training programs 
within the company. 
 
An interactive online sustainability and social impact training focusing 
on contracting and delivered to business leaders and specific project 
teams. The course covers our sustainability approach, Environmental 
and Social Policy and relevant (international) guidelines, alongside 
practical steps to apply these on our projects. During 2023 we 
updated the training program and added specific Offshore Energy 
components to ensure it meets the needs of both divisions. The training 
concludes with a live session on a division-specific case study. The 
new training was rolled out during the fourth quarter.  
An E&S management training for representatives within the Dredging 
& Inland Infra division. The training has been developed by the 
UK-based NGO Earth Active and builds on the above sustainability 
and social impact training to further develop team members’ expertise 
in applying international standards (including IFC Performance 
Standards and ISO 14001) and wider sustainability principles. 
Training sessions were held in May 2023 for leading roles within the 
business, including tender managers. 
Marine Environmental Awareness Course: this newly-revised course 
was delivered to vessel captains, chief officers, and 2nd and 3rd 
officers across our Offshore Energy and Dredging & Inland Infra 
divisions. The course is split into three compulsory components: 
e-learning modules, practical workboxes and an in-person workshop. 
Topics include sustainable shipping, marine environment, waste, 
emissions, energy and climate change.
SUSTAINABILITY LEADERSHIP
In March 2023, a total of 15 business leaders from Dredging & 
Inland Infra, Offshore Energy and Salvage came together off site for a 
Sustainability Week led by the Director Sustainability. The purpose of 
the week was to increase awareness on sustainability topics and a 
range of initiatives within different parts of the business as part of 
broader efforts to exchange experience and lessons learned. Since 
March, there has been regular and active engagement between the 
Sustainability Department and this group of leaders which has 
provided support to the development of a number of in-house 
sustainability initiatives.

Page 47:
During 2023 our New Manila International Airport Project in the 
Philippines received a positive assessment of its management of 
environmental and social (E&S) risks following an independent review 
commissioned by the Dutch government.  
In December 2020, Boskalis was awarded a contract by San Miguel 
Aerocity for the development of a land platform in Manila Bay on 
which the new airport will be built.
The scale and location of the project brings with it extensive E&S 
complexities which were identified through a series of assessments 
and due diligence studies in accordance with international standards 
resulting in an Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) that was 
agreed between our client and the financiers of the project. 
Certain aspects of the approach to managing the impacts of the 
project have been the subject of criticism by NGOs, most recently in 
2023. However a report submitted by independent consultants to the 
Dutch Ministry of Finance last July concluded that the E&S monitoring 
process put in place to oversee the approach to E&S management “is 
structured, robust and intensive”. The report added that the quarterly 
monitoring report on the progress of the ESAP compiled by the 
financiers’ own E&S consultants was “extremely comprehensive”.  
Over the last two years we have worked with our partners and client 
to devise and implement a range of E&S safeguards that support the 
effective management of the project’s risks and impacts. These include 
a stakeholder grievance mechanism within local communities in 
Manila Bay, supplemented by active dialogue and communication via 
designated community interlocutors. Our wider social program has 
included the creation of local jobs together with targeted training 
programs and capacity-building, safety support for impacted fishing 
communities, and a range of conservation projects. Meanwhile, 
Boskalis has developed detailed biodiversity management plans that, 
wherever possible, mitigate or compensate for impacts on the natural 
habitat at the project site.  
We continue to support our client in advancing solutions for the E&S 
challenges associated with the project and are proud to contribute to 
the new airport and the future socio-economic growth it will bring to 
Manila Bay and the wider region.

our operations. We have a Human Rights and Labor Policy that sets 
out the guiding principles for Boskalis to conduct its business, which 
is developed in line with the United Nations Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and 
applicable national and international labor laws, including the 
conventions of the International Labour Organization. We seek to 
identify adverse impacts related to human rights and labor caused 
by our business activities before they occur and take appropriate 
steps to avoid, cease, minimize or mitigate them.
SANCTIONS POLICY
Boskalis does not perform any activities that are subject to 
international and/or national sanctions and does not have dealings 
with sanctioned persons. In addition, we follow the laws concerning 
export control for military and dual-use goods and services. The 
guiding principles regarding sanctions are laid down in the Boskalis 
Code of Conduct and our Sanctions Policy.
TAX POLICY
The payment of taxes forms an important part of our contribution to 
the countries and communities in which we operate. Our approach to 
tax supports the purpose and the corporate business strategy of 
Boskalis. Our Boskalis Code of Conduct and the underlying Tax Policy 
reflect our guiding principles that we are responsible taxpayers 
managing our tax affairs accurately and transparently to the letter and 
the spirit of the applicable tax laws and regulations. Boskalis supports 
the OECD initiatives to promote tax transparency and reform of 
international tax regulations to end tax avoidance strategies and to 
come to fair tax systems. As part of the biennial review of the tax 
policy, we conduct various dialogues with external stakeholders.
SPEAK UP POLICY
Boskalis has a Speak Up Policy in place that offers employees and 
directors the possibility to report (suspected) misconduct within the 
company to a confidential and independent counselor without the risk 
of any retaliation. The Speak Up Policy is developed in line with 
international and national applicable laws and the OECD Guidelines 
for Multinational Enterprises. Under the Speak Up Policy a report of 
(suspected) misconduct can be made on any subject of a general, 
safety, financial, operational, social or employment nature, 
including but not limited to violation of health- and safety procedures, 
discrimination, racism, (sexual) abuse, fraud, bribery, or other criminal 
acts and environmental misdemeanors. Employees also have the 
possibility to consult a female counselor. Such a report can be made 
anonymously and on a 24/7 basis. The counselor shall take the 
reported suspected misconduct into consideration immediately and 
gain information in relation to this. Based on this information the 
counselor shall decide which actions are appropriate and necessary, 
including a possible investigation on the reported misconduct. The 
employee who has in good faith reported the suspected misconduct to 
the counselor, in accordance with the Speak Up Policy, shall not risk 
any retaliation or detriment as a consequence of making a report.
GRIEVANCE POLICY
Boskalis strives for open and clear communication with our various 
external stakeholders and is open to suggestions, ideas, complaints, 
grievances and criticism. The Grievance Policy describes how we 
offer our external stakeholders the possibility to bring forward any 
grievance without the risk of any retaliation. Grievances may be 
treated on a confidential basis upon request and can be made 
anonymously on a 24/7 basis. At project level, Boskalis frequently 
offers a targeted local grievance mechanism to ensure transparency 
and engagement with our local stakeholders. Such grievance 
mechanisms are based on the Grievance Policy. 
RESPONSIBLE SOURCING
OUR SUPPLY CHAIN 
Our relationships with our suppliers are fundamental to the success of 
our business and the realization of our sustainability ambitions. Our 
contractual expectations of our suppliers’ approach to environmental, 
social and governance risks reflect our own high standards and are 
outlined in our Supplier Code of Conduct. 
Each year we perform an Implementation Scan at a selection of our 
contracted suppliers to monitor compliance with the Supplier Code of 
Conduct. These scans are conducted through either in-person visits or 
online meetings with a (digital) tour of the relevant facility. 
Our central procurement office maintains relationships with 
approximately 1,700 direct suppliers. Of these, 80% are based in 
the Netherlands, 11% in other European countries and 9% outside 
Europe. The number of our suppliers varies from year to year based 
on the profile of our current projects. In 2023, 258 of our suppliers 
were strategic partners, who together accounted for around 90% of 
central purchasing volume. 
PRE-QUALIFICATION PROCESS 
Boskalis implements a standard and transparent pre-qualification 
process that our suppliers are required to complete prior to doing 
business with us. The pre-qualification process includes acceptance of 
our Supplier Code of Conduct and completing our sustainability 
questionnaire which is designed to increase engagement with 
suppliers and subcontractors on a range of environmental, social and 
governance issues. Our pre-qualification process is included in our 
Way of Working quality management system. Based on objective risk 
48


Page 51:
criteria, suppliers may also be required to complete a detailed 
pre-qualification assessment in one or more of the following areas: 
Health and Safety, Quality, Environmental, Corporate Social 
Responsibility, Financial/Insurance, or Supply Chain Management.
OUR SUPPLIER CODE OF CONDUCT 
Besides selection criteria such as quality, delivery and reliability, our 
central procurement department requires suppliers to accept and 
adhere to our Supplier Code of Conduct (please see page 46 for 
more details). Our approach incorporates the principles of the Dutch 
Expertise Network for Procurement and Supply Management (NEVI) 
Code of Conduct, which helps procurement professionals deal with 
the ethical dilemmas they face as part of the procurement process. In 
2023, 82% of our strategic suppliers (by spend) signed or endorsed 
the Supplier Code of Conduct. In addition to the Supplier Code of 
Conduct, we work with our suppliers on a number of collaborative 
sustainability initiatives, such as:
  research, validation and implementation of cleaner engines; 
  environmentally friendly fuels; 
  energy savings; 
  human rights and responsible business conduct; 
  sustainable dismantling of our vessels; 
  cradle-to-cradle and recycling concepts. 
IMPLEMENTATION SCANS 
In addition to the pre-qualification process completed by our  
suppliers, Boskalis also commissions a third party to conduct annual 
Implementation Scans at a selection of our contracted suppliers to 
verify compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct. Since 2012, 
Implementation Scans have been carried out at 175 suppliers, with 
61 visits to foreign suppliers located in 20 countries, including 
Vietnam, China, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, Turkey, and 
Tunisia. Past experience suggests that this process contributes to 
improvements in the sustainability standards and processes adopted 
by our suppliers.
The scans comprise a sustainability questionnaire based on our 
Supplier Code of Conduct, as well as a separate audit and risk 
assessment. The reporting format is based on the socially responsible 
procurement method of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and 
Supply. Where any causes for concern are identified by the scan, our 
suppliers receive a set of recommendations which support improvements 
in their sustainability approach.
2023 IMPLEMENTATION SCAN RESULTS 
This year 20 suppliers were reviewed. Of these, 15 were new 
suppliers and five were suppliers that had been reviewed previously. 
Of the recurring visits we found that all suppliers but one had 
improved their risk profile since the previous scan and all five now 
rank in the highest category based on the impact/risk assessment 
methodology. Please see the results of the 2023 Implementations 
Scans on page 66.
As well as the overall risk assessment for each supplier, we receive 
a qualitative report from our third-party auditors. This covers the 
steps our suppliers have taken or are developing on sustainability, 
including but not limited to safety, environmental management, 
effective governance and responsible business conduct, protecting 
human rights and limiting their carbon emissions. The reports also 
indicate how our business partners are approaching sustainability 
risks with their own suppliers. In this way, we gain a more complete 
understanding of the risks and opportunities through our value chain 
and develop a platform to both strengthen our supplier relationships 
and improve performance in the future.
SUSTAINABLE RECYCLING 
Our approach to ship dismantling is embedded within our 
Environmental and Social Policy and is focused on safe and 
sustainable dismantling. We follow existing international legislation 
and regulations in this area and have been repeatedly recognized as 
an industry leader by the NGO Shipbreaking Platform. Our vessels 
are dismantled by third parties and prerequisites for our policy 
include: strict safety requirements, a hard surface on which to 
dismantle the vessel, and responsible disposal of waste. For each 
vessel, the possibilities for responsible dismantling locally are assessed 
and weighed against the environmental and other costs of transporting 
it over a long distance, for example to a certified ship dismantling 
yard in Europe. Where relevant, agreements are made with local 
yards in close consultation with the NGO Shipbreaking Platform to 
adapt business processes in such a way that they meet Boskalis’ 
stringent requirements.
During the ship dismantling process, knowledge is shared with local 
yards. Vessels are dismantled at certified shipyards in accordance 
with the Hong Kong Convention and Boskalis’ own standards. For 
500 GT+ vessels that will be dismantled or are offered for sale, we 
draw up an Inventory of Hazardous Materials (IHM). In the event a 
vessel is sold, we incorporate the sales contract for future dismantling; 
the new owner must also do so in accordance with the Hong Kong 
Convention. In 2019 the EU Ship Recycling Regulation (EU SRR) came 
into effect. The EU SRR sets out strict procedures for the recycling of 
European flagged ships, both covering the method of waste processing 
as well as designating specific facilities for the recycling procedures. 
The EU SRR coexists next to the EU Waste Shipment Regulation, which 
applies to non-EU flagged ships which are situated within the EU. 
Boskalis follows these regulations.
In 2023, a limited number of relatively small Boskalis vessels were 
dismantled at certified yards in Europe.

GOVERNANCE 
Boskalis operates with the Board of Management and the Supervisory 
Board a two-tier Board model, which means that management and 
supervision are segregated. For a comprehensive overview of the 
company’s Governance please see pages 34 to 37 of the Annual 
Review.
The Board of Management is responsible for the day-to-day 
management of the business, the continuity of the company, and for 
setting out and realizing the company’s strategy. The Board of 
Management is responsible for setting the company’s objectives, 
managing risks and opportunities, implementing the business policies 
and for the overall performance. The Board of Management is 
accountable to the Supervisory Board and the General Meeting of 
Shareholders. In performing its tasks, the Board of Management is 
guided by the interests of the company and its activities, the 
markets the company is operating in, and takes into account any 
relevant interests of parties involved with the company. The Board of 
Management performs a periodic double materiality assessment to set 
priorities in topics important to the business and its stakeholders. The 
outcome of this assessment is used in the formulation of the company’s 
strategy for the long-term and, in particular, sustainable growth. 
Please refer to pages 10 to 13 of this Sustainability Report.
The Supervisory Board is responsible for supervising the Board of 
Management on the formulation and implementation of the strategy 
for the long term. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board is responsible 
for supervising management performance regarding the general 
affairs of the company and advising the Board of Management. The 
Supervisory Board is supported in its work by three core committees: 
the Audit Committee, the Nomination & Remuneration Committee and 
the ESG Committee. For a summary of the activities of the Supervisory 
Board, please refer to pages 16 to 19 of the Annual Review.
At Boskalis there is close collaboration between the Supervisory 
Board, its committees and the Board of Management. The Board of 
Management and the Supervisory Board are jointly responsible for 
looking after the interests of our stakeholders.
At least one General Meeting of Shareholders takes place every year. 
Its tasks include the adoption of financial statements, and it holds 
authority with regard to the appointment and dismissal of Supervisory 
Board members and the members of the Board of Management.
The interests of employees are promoted by the Works Council, which 
provides ongoing employee representation as required under the 
Dutch Works Councils Act.
LONG-TERM STRATEGY
Boskalis focuses on its long-term strategy and the continuity of the 
company through its purpose and mission. The purpose of Boskalis is 
to create and protect prosperity and advance the energy transition. 
The mission is that the company strives to be the leading dredging 
and marine contracting expert, creating new horizons for all its 
stakeholders. This view of the Board of Management on the long-term 
strategy is translated into a corporate business plan, which is formulated 
by the Board of Management on a thorough review of Boskalis’ 
markets and business lines. The Supervisory Board is fully engaged in 
the formulation of the strategy and the Corporate Business Plan and 
oversees its implementation. 
For a detailed description of Boskalis’ long-term and Sustainable 
Growth strategy please refer to pages 10 to 13 of this Sustainability 
Report and pages 10 to 13 of our Annual Review .
CULTURE
At Boskalis our purpose is to create and protect prosperity and 
advance the energy transition. We seek to foster a culture in which 
our employees identify strongly with our purpose and embrace the 
core values of the business. A strong culture builds cohesion and 
enables our people to develop and achieve mutual goals, thereby 
contributing to the long-term success of the company.
We are committed to promoting an inclusive culture aligned with our 
core values of safety, teamwork, professionalism, entrepreneurship 
and responsibleness. To support such a working environment, we rely 
on the leadership and tone set by senior management as well as 
regular engagement with our staff. This is further bolstered by aligning 
our performance review framework around our core values. Through 
periodic employee engagement surveys, we monitor aspects of our 
culture and the extent to which they align with our values and purpose. 
Boskalis places a strong emphasis on integrity and business ethics, an 
area where we are further increasing our engagement with staff 
through training and e-learning around our Code of Conduct. As a 
project-based organization, with a global footprint, we rely on the 
highest ethical standards and levels of trust among individuals and 
teams working in complex operating environments. The Supervisory 
Board has been involved in the formulation of the Boskalis Code of 
Conduct and discusses its implementation and effectiveness with the 
Board of Management on a regular basis. Further information on the 
Boskalis Code of Conduct, its underlying policies and the core values 
are to be found on pages 46 to 49 of this Sustainability Report.
The culture within the company, the values, the Boskalis Code of 
Conduct and the work and safety culture programs are also standard 
topics on the agenda of the meetings with the Works Council. Members 
of the Supervisory Board are regular attendees at these meetings.

In the opinion of the Board of Management and the Supervisory 
Board, the culture within Boskalis supports its purpose and mission to 
create long-term value for all stakeholders and delivers good
results in compliance and effectiveness.
DIVERSITY
Boskalis relies on a team of dedicated, experienced professionals to 
achieve its ambitions. That is why Boskalis is committed to creating a 
diverse and inclusive workplace that challenges and inspires the 
employees to build their careers and achieve their potential within 
Boskalis. Boskalis is an international employer that attracts and selects 
the best talent from around the world to maintain its position as a 
frontrunner in the industry. The importance of diversity is reflected 
within the Boskalis Code of Conduct and the underlying Human Rights 
and Labor Policy.
Boskalis does not accept discrimination in the workplace and has a 
strong practice throughout the organization of equal opportunities for 
all regardless of race, color, nationality, ethnic or social background, 
age, religion, political opinion, gender, pregnancy, sexual orientation, 
marital status, disability, trade union membership or any other 
characteristics protected by applicable law. To create a more balanced 
representation of gender on the work floor, Boskalis aims to attract, 
retain and promote women for and throughout the organization. 
Boskalis ensures that its job descriptions are gender neutral. The 
recruitment process is based on an Objective Assessment Model, 
setting profiles based on competencies without prior knowledge about 
the applicant to prevent unconscious bias on gender, age or ethnicity. 
Internal and external recruiters are specifically tasked to identify and 
submit capable female candidates. In the management development 
and trainee programs special attention is paid to eligible female 
candidates.
In line with the Boskalis Code of Conduct and the underlying Human 
Rights and Labor Policy, the Supervisory Board has drawn up a 
diversity policy and plan for the composition of the Board of 
Management, the Supervisory Board and the senior management 
explaining the company’s broad view on diversity, whereby the 
principle of the best person for the job is leading. This Diversity Policy 
is in accordance with the Act to improve gender diversity in the 
boards of Dutch companies and to include a plan on the incorporation 
of more diversity within the Board of Management, the Supervisory 
Board and the senior management.
As described in the Diversity Policy, the composition and size of the 
Board of Management are based on the profile and strategy of the 
company. The expertise, experience and various competencies of the 
members of the Board of Management should contribute to this profile 
and strategy. The goal for the composition of the Board of Management 
is to aim as much as possible for a diverse composition, whereby for 
every appointment the principle of the best person for the job is 
leading. The employee population of Boskalis, partly due to the nature 
of the business activities, is predominantly male, especially in the core 
processes on the fleet and in the projects. The current Board of 
Management with four male members can be seen as a reflection of 
that employee population. In the year under review no changes 
occurred in the composition of the Board of Management. The 
Supervisory Board has decided to aim to improve the gender diversity 
of the Board of Management with the appointment of at least one 
female member to the Board of Management in or before 2025.
Ultimo 2023, 14% of the senior management team of Boskalis is 
female. Boskalis has decided to adopt a target to improve gender 
diversity of its the senior management; with this target the percentage 
of female leaders will be increased to 20% in or before 2025.
The composition and size of the Supervisory Board are also based on 
the company’s profile and strategy. As stated in the profile of the 
Supervisory Board and the Diversity Policy, the expertise, experience 
and various competencies of members of the Supervisory Board 
should contribute to proper supervision of the company’s management 
and general performance. The goal for the composition of the 
Supervisory Board is to aim as much as possible for a diverse 
composition, where possible taking into account the statutory 
requirements and the requirements related to education and 
experience contained in the Diversity Policy. Per ultimo 2023 this 
resulted in four members of the Supervisory Board being male and 
two members being female. In view of the objective of achieving a 
balanced representation on the Supervisory Board, emphasis is 
placed on diversity when drafting the profile for new members of the 
Supervisory Board. In the year under review no changes occurred in 
the composition of the Supervisory Board. The current composition of 
the Supervisory Board is in line with the Act to improve gender 
diversity in the boards of Dutch companies. The Supervisory Board 
will continue to adhere to the requirements of the Act to improve 
gender diversity in the boards of Dutch companies in its future 
selection and appointment procedures for the Supervisory Board.

ABOUT THIS  
REPORT 
PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF THE REPORT 
We have been reporting on our sustainability approach, performance 
and results in a separate annual Sustainability Report since 2009. The 
scope of our sustainability reporting is based on the information 
requirements of our key stakeholders. Our key stakeholders have an 
influence on our license to operate and may be significantly impacted 
by our activities. In order to ensure that our approach to sustainability 
meets with the priorities of our stakeholders we update our materiality 
analysis on a periodic basis, most recently in 2023. We also keep 
track of key environmental, social and governance developments 
within our industry, as well as our reporting obligations as a company. 
The Sustainability Report sets out the key elements of our updated 
business strategy and how we integrate sustainability across our 
activities, a process informed by our materiality assessment and our 
broader management of our environmental and social impact. The 
report provides details about how we manage the risks and 
opportunities related to our principal sustainability topics and, where 
possible, gives measurable indicators of our performance and impacts.
The Sustainability Report includes sustainability data from entities that 
are fully or majority owned by Boskalis and from joint ventures in  
which Boskalis has a controlling interest. Boskalis also relies on a 
significant number of subcontractors to perform daily activities. Boskalis 
acknowledges its responsibility for the safety of its subcontractors  
and they are therefore included in its safety performance reporting. 
Divestments are reported in accordance with the financial reporting 
rules for consolidation. This means that acquisitions are reported as 
from the moment control (ownership) is acquired. Divestments are 
reported up to the moment that control is relinquished. 
The Sustainability Report may contain forward-looking statements. 
Such statements are based on current expectations, estimates and 
projections of Boskalis’ management and information currently 
available to the company. Such forward-looking statements are not 
certain and contain elements of risk that are difficult to predict and 
therefore Boskalis does not guarantee that its expectations will be 
realized. Boskalis is under no obligation to update the statements 
contained in this report. 
REPORTING PROCESS 
The Sustainability Report is compiled by a multidisciplinary team 
under the responsibility of the Board of Management. Its content 
was discussed with the Supervisory Board. The consolidation of 
sustainability data takes place at successive levels, starting with the 
projects and local office organizations, moving up through the 
relevant business units and staff departments and ending with the 
consolidated group reports. This is based on quarterly reporting via 
a dedicated online SAP-based reporting tool, which is monitored by 
our Group Accounting & Reporting department, in close consultation 
with our Sustainability Department and Corporate Communications 
department that are jointly responsible for the production of the 
Sustainability Report. In addition, as in previous years, a number of 
internal audits were conducted on material sustainability topics and 
indicators in 2023. Although we are confident that our internal 
audit ensures a reasonable level of data reliability, we have our 
sustainability information verified by an external assurance provider. 
REPORTING PRINCIPLES 
Our Sustainability Report and sustainability data are prepared in 
accordance with our reporting principles, which are based on national 
and international reporting guidelines. KPIs are developed for key 
strategic topics and/or areas that are viewed to be material based on 
our materiality assessment and an interactive dialogue with stakeholders. 
EXTERNAL VERIFICATION 
The information contained in this report faithfully represents the 
outcome of systematic data gathering and analysis. As in previous 
years, Boskalis appointed an external assurance provider to verify its 
key sustainability metrics. Please refer to page 68 for the assurance 
report and conclusion of our external assurance provider. 
RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL
Retaining control and balance in our risk-taking is fundamental to our 
pursuit of sustainable growth. This involves the proper identification, 
assessment, and management of risks and opportunities, particularly 
in crucial areas such as tendering, project preparation, and execution. 
The management of sustainability risks and opportunities seamlessly 
extends into our operations and is therefore fully embedded in our 
management systems.
The internal risk management and control systems at Boskalis are 
founded on direct management supervision, tailored to the global 
working environment of the company. One of their cornerstones is our 
company culture, which is characterized by a high degree of 
transparency regarding the timely identification, evaluation, and 
reporting of risks, as well as a remuneration system that is geared to 
avoiding potentially perverse incentives.
At the core of Boskalis’ approach to risk management and internal 
control is a group-wide project management system designed 
according to the principles and guidance of the ISO 31000 standard 
for risk management. The primary objective of this system - which we 
refer to as our Way of Working - is to provide optimal support to our 
staff throughout the project lifecycle, with a specific focus on achieving 
operational excellence, safety, high quality, and sustainable solutions. 
For all business units, external certification bodies have (re-) confirmed 
that the implementation of the Way of Working complies with the most 
recent applicable international (ISO) standards for quality, safety, and 
environmental management systems.
54


Page 57:
Daily management at Boskalis is characterized by short 
communication lines, decisiveness, and hands-on involvement. We 
also prioritize structured periodic reporting and reviews at both the 
Board of Management and senior management levels to oversee the 
progress and development of individual projects and business units. 
Additionally, management reports are thoroughly discussed with 
business unit managers in quarterly meetings, while consolidated 
group reports undergo a quarterly review with the Supervisory Board.
Regular internal audits, conducted under the auspices of our 
Corporate Safety, Health, Environment, and Quality (SHE-Q) 
department, assess the design and operational effectiveness of these 
systems. These audits are discussed at quarterly meetings between the 
Board of Management and business unit management.
In addition to SHE-Q audits, Boskalis maintains an internal audit 
function specifically focused on the company’s management reporting 
processes. This internal audit function adheres to the International 
Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing and the 
Code of Ethics published by The Institute of Internal Auditors.
An annual Corporate Risk Assessment, initiated by the Board of 
Management, systematically evaluates risks inherent to the Group’s 
activities and objectives. The assessment utilizes a comprehensive risk 
classification system, including examples of possible (sustainability) 
risk manifestations and current risk management and internal control 
activities. 
We acknowledge that our internal risk management and control 
systems cannot guarantee absolute certainty in achieving all our 
objectives. The dynamic nature of business and external factors means 
that these systems cannot fully preclude material mistakes, losses, 
fraud, or infringements of legislation and regulations. Therefore, the 
organization remains committed to diligent oversight and continuous 
improvement in its risk management and internal control practices.
POLICIES
Effectively managing our material sustainability topics requires the 
coordinated efforts of several of our (central) functions and 
departments, including Strategy, Safety, Health, Environment and 
Quality (SHE—Q), Sustainability, Research & Development, HR, ICT, 
Legal, Compliance, among others. Projects focused on energy 
transition and climate adaptation are carried out by the respective 
business units within our Dredging & Inland Infra and Offshore Energy 
divisions, increasingly in combination.
As part of our regular Management Planning System (MPS) and 
Management Control System (MCS) methodology and cycle, every 
department, function, and business unit is required – within the context 
of our corporate business plan – to annually develop or revise policies 
and associated performance indicators. This considers relevant 
normative frameworks and guidelines developed by external parties 
including, but not limited to, ISO, International Maritime Organization, 
International Labour Organization, OECD, and United Nations.
Through our regular MPS and MCS methodology and cycle, Boskalis’ 
highest governance bodies closely monitor the timely implementation 
of all these policy aspects. This is done through elaborate reporting 
systems and intensive periodic review meetings with all individual 
departments, functions, and business units.
In addition to senior management, multiple specialized internal and 
external audit and control functions are designated to help ensure the 
correct implementation of our policies.
TIME HORIZONS
Where the time horizons of key actions are concerned, within a sizable 
organization such as Boskalis, a diverse set of key actions is consistently 
being defined and implemented, each with specific and varying time 
horizons corresponding to those particular actions. These (key) actions 
and their timelines are outlined in the detailed (annual) plans of all 
departments, functions, divisions, and business units within Boskalis.
METHODS OF ESTIMATION, MEASUREMENT AND 
CALCULATION 
We use generally accepted protocols to compile, measure and present 
information. We aim to ensure the reliability of our reported data by 
performing internal audits and externally verifying our data. However, 
due to generic challenges in the data collection process and the 
nature of sustainability data, there are limitations associated with 
measuring and calculating data. Here we elaborate on the 
methodology, calculations and inherent limitations of the data. 
HR DATA 
The detailed HR data in this report covers our own employees and 
excludes those of joint ventures and employees seconded from other 
companies to Boskalis (e.g. Anglo Eastern crew). For our detailed HR 
reporting, please refer to page 61.
CO2 DATA 
The CO2 equivalent (CO2eq) data covers fuel consumed by vessels of 
the Dredging & Inland Infra and Offshore Energy divisions as well as 
our onshore dry earthmoving equipment in the Netherlands. 
  Conversion of MT of vessel fuel to CO2eq takes place according to 
the IMO Guidelines on Life Cycle GHG Intensity of Marine Fuels 
(July 2023), using the following conversion factor per MT of fuel:
  – MGO/MDO 3.255 MT CO2eq
  – VLSFO/HFO 3.163 MT CO2eq 
55


Page 58:
  Conversion of MT of fuel for onshore equipment to CO2eq takes 
place according to the conversion factors published by the 
Netherlands’ Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy.
 – Diesel 2.938 MT CO2eq 
  Conversion of m3 of biofuel to CO2eq takes place according to 
DEFRA carbon emission factors, using the following conversion 
factor per MT of fuel:
 – Biofuel 0.04562 MT CO2eq 
SAFETY DATA 
Our safety data covers all our own employees, including 
subcontractors that work under our supervision. Lost Time Injury (LTI) 
expresses the number of workplace accidents serious enough to result 
in absence from work. Lost Time Injury Frequency (LTIF) expresses the 
number of workplace accidents resulting in absence from work per 
200,000 hours worked. The LTIF overview on page 64 shows a 
breakdown for the various divisions. In addition to LTIF, we also 
provide the Total Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR). TRIR is composed of 
LTIs, Medical Treatment Cases and Restricted Work Cases, per 
200,000 hours worked.  
SUPPLY CHAIN DATA 
The supply chain data refers to the procurement spend by the 
strategic suppliers of the Central Procurement department. A total of 
258 of these suppliers are regarded as strategic partners who  
account for about 90% of the Corporate Procurement department’s 
purchasing volume. 
REVENUE PER PRIORITY SDG 
For revenue mapping to the SDG’s, each project, if applicable, is 
assigned an SDG sustainability tag. A project can only have one 
sustainability tag. Even if a project contributes to multiple SDG 
sub-targets, there is no disaggregation of revenue within a project to 
multiple tags; the largest revenue share determines which SDG is 
applicable to any given project. There is one exception: SDG 8 
Decent Work and Economic Growth. In principle, all projects 
contribute to this overarching SDG. Per SDG, the following types of 
projects are presumed to contribute to the SDG goals:
  SDG 7 - Affordable and Clean Energy: includes all activities and 
services primarily related to energy transition including renewables, 
(natural) gas, and all decommissioning related activities; 
  SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure: includes all activities 
and services primarily to the maintenance and/or development of 
maritime infrastructure such as ports, land reclamation, inland infra 
such as road-related developments; 
  SDG 13 - Climate Action: includes all activities and services 
primarily related to adaptive measures against climate change such 
as protection of land from flooding, development of polders and 
dike related activities; 
  SDG 14 - Life Below Water: includes all activities and services 
primarily related to the salvaging of vessels; 
  SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth: in principle, all 
activities and services contribute to SDG 8. 
TURBIDITY EXCEEDANCES 
This relates to the number of exceedances of turbidity limits, that 
resulted in operational downtime, recorded on projects with a turbidity 
scope. Such exceedances must be related to dredging operations as 
opposed to other factors, such as weather. 
SPILLS DATA 
Our spills data covers all oil and fuel spills originating from (majority) 
owned and operated vessels where the quantity of the spill is more 
than a barrel of oil or fuel into the marine environment. 
PUBLICATION DATE 
The Sustainability Report 2023 was published at the same time as the 
Annual Review 2023 on 7 March 2024 on the corporate website.

EU TAXONOMY 
The EU Taxonomy Regulation sets out a basis for a classification system 
with the aim of providing companies, investors and policymakers with 
appropriate definitions for which economic activities can be considered 
environmentally sustainable. To be recognized as such, economic 
activities will have to make a substantial contribution to at least one of 
the EU’s climate and environmental objectives, while also doing no 
significant harm to the others and meeting a prescribed set of minimum 
social safeguards. 
The Taxonomy Regulation establishes the following six environmental 
objectives: 
  Climate change mitigation; 
  Climate change adaptation; 
  The sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources; 
  The transition to a circular economy; 
  Pollution prevention and control; 
  The protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. 
The Taxonomy Regulation identifies environmentally sustainable 
economic activities based on technical screening criteria which are set 
out in so-called accompanying delegated acts. In December 2021, the 
European Council approved the Climate Delegated Act which contains 
technical screening criteria for activities that contribute substantially to 
the climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives. A second 
delegated act – the Environmental Delegated Act – concerning the 
technical screening criteria for the remaining four environmental 
objectives, was published in June 2023.

B. TAXONOMY NON ELIGIBLE ACTIVITIES 73-78% 70-75% 73-78%
TOTAL (A+B) 100% 100% 100%
Companies reporting under the EU Taxonomy should report on the 
‘eligibility’ of their economic activities under the Climate Delegated 
Act. In this context, eligibility means that an activity is included in this 
delegated act and thus has the potential to make a substantial 
contribution to the environmental objectives of the Taxonomy 
Regulation. Companies should also report on the ‘alignment’ of their 
economic activities. Taxonomy-alignment of an activity goes beyond 
eligibility and implies that an activity fully complies with the technical 
requirements and social safeguards enumerated for this activity.

BOSKALIS APPROACH 
FOR MANAGING POTENTIAL  
ADVERSE IMPACT 
 
Our activities add value for our business and our clients. However, 
despite our extensive expertise around the implementation of such 
projects, we are not always in the position to directly influence the 
overall design or implementation strategy of a project. This could 
be the case if we become involved at a later stage in the project 
preparation, as a subcontractor on a project or in the case of countries 
where the inclusion of environmental or social considerations in contracts 
are not mandatory by law. In these cases we strive to proactively take 
measures to identify any environmental and social impact our activities 
may cause before they occur. We then take appropriate action to 
avoid, minimize or mitigate them. In those cases where our influence is 
restricted, we use our leverage by entering into dialog with the 
relevant stakeholders. Where we can, we aim to promote positive 
contributions.  
For reference, the Boskalis approach for managing potential adverse 
impact is illustrated below.
Based on OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.

HOW WE ENGAGED  
Engaging in regular dialogue with internal and external stakeholders is central to our ability to understand their views and expectations. 
Stakeholder engagement is a core part of the periodic materiality process, while additional, regular dialogue also takes place across the 
business in order to better understand the needs of our stakeholders. Our Board of Management are, in turn, informed about the views and 
interests of affected stakeholders in a number of ways, including the materiality assessment process, quarterly reporting from business units and 
departments across the organization, site and vessel visits, its regular engagement with the Works Council, and targeted employee surveys, 
among others. While we have a wide range of stakeholders, our key stakeholder groups are set out below.

INDEPENDENT 
ASSURANCE REPORT 
 To the Stakeholders of Royal Boskalis B.V.
Introduction and objectives of work
Bureau Veritas Inspection & Certification The Netherlands B.V. (Bureau Veritas) 
was engaged by Royal Boskalis B.V. (Boskalis) to provide limited assurance 
over selected performance indicators to be presented in its Sustainability 
Report 2023 (“the Report”). The objective is to provide assurance to Boskalis 
and its stakeholders over the accuracy and reliability of the reported 
information and data.
Scope of work
The scope of our work was limited to assurance over the following information 
included within the Report for the period 1st January to 
31st December 2023 (the ‘Selected Information’):
  Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions;
  Fuel consumption of marine gas oil (MGO), Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil 
(VLSO) and heavy fuel oil (HFO) from the fleet;
  Total Scope 1 & Scope 2 (location-based) GHG emissions;
  Number of employees in Boskalis majority owned entities broken down by: 
- employment contract (permanent or temporary contract) and by gender; 
- employment type (part-time, full-time) and by gender; 
- country and number of nationalities;
  Inflow and outflow of employees in Boskalis majority owned entities broken 
down by age (<30, 30-50, >50) and gender, and outflow by reason;
  Percentage of employees in Boskalis majority owned entities covered by 
collective bargaining agreements broken down by gender;
  Composition of workforce in Boskalis majority owned entities broken down 
by gender and by age (<30, 30-50, <50);
  Number of training hours broken down by gender and by job category 
(management, office staff, project staff, crew/yard staff);
  Human Excellence (text and data);
  Lost Time Injury Frequency (LTIF);
  Total Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR);
  Total number of Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) (includes fatalities);
  Health and Safety (text and data);
  Spend represented by strategic suppliers;
  Percentage of strategic suppliers who have signed the Boskalis Supplier 
Code of Conduct (or who follow a Code of Conduct that is considered 
equivalent to the Boskalis Supplier Code of Conduct);
  Double Materiality Assessment (DMA) (text);
  EU Taxonomy (text and data);
  Spills recorded by Boskalis owned vessels that exceed one barrel of oil; and
  Turbidity exceedances that result in project downtime. 
Reporting criteria
The Selected Information needs to be read and understood together with the 
Boskalis ‘Methods of Estimation, Measurement and Calculation’, a copy of 
which is available in the ‘About this Report’ section of the Report. The  
EU Taxonomy section is reported according to the EU Taxonomy Regulation 
(EU 2020/852) and the Climate Delegated Act (EU 2021/2139 and  
EU 2023/2485).
Limitations and Exclusions
Excluded from the scope of our work is any verification of information 
relating to:
  Activities outside the defined assurance period;
  Positional statements of a descriptive or interpretative nature, or of opinion, 
belief, aspiration or commitment to undertake future actions; and
  Other information included in the Report other than the scope of work 
defined above. 
The following limitations should be noted:
  This limited assurance engagement relies on a risk based selected sample of 
sustainability data and the associated limitations that this entails.
  The review of EU Taxonomy eligibility data is based on a risk sample of 
documentation for projects and capex to review the estimated range of 
eligibility under the Delegated Acts. This review does not include verification 
of financial data (revenue, capex or opex) which are audited separately by 
an external financial auditor.
  For capex, current projections and scheduling estimations for projects have 
been used to confirm eligibility and alignment on a sample basis. As most 
assets can be used flexibly, it is possible that the assets currently considered 
as eligible/ aligned may be used for non-eligible/ aligned projects in future 
years;
  The assessment of EU Taxonomy alignment for Boskalis offshore wind 
projects is based on climate risk and vulnerability assessments being carried 
out. This requirement is considered met as risk assessments are an inherent 
part of the permitting process for offshore wind projects. However, while 
these risks assessments are available at the wind project clients of Boskalis, 
they were not available to review as part of the assurance activities;
  The review of the DMA text was limited to alignment of the double 
materiality process described in the Report with the process followed by 
Boskalis in 2023 and the principle of double materiality as outlined in 
Section 3 ESRS 1 of the European Sustainability Reporting Standards, but 
has not been reviewed against the detailed disclosure requirements or 
recommendations of ESRS 2 or any other Regulations or guidance;
  This independent statement should not be relied upon to detect all errors, 
omissions or misstatements that may exist. 
Responsibilities
The preparation and presentation of the Selected Information in the Report are 
the sole responsibility of the management of Boskalis. 
The responsibilities of Bureau Veritas were to: 
Obtain limited assurance over the Selected Information;
  Form an independent conclusion based on the assurance procedures 
performed and evidence obtained; and
  Report our conclusions to the Boskalis Board of Management.
Assessment Standard
We performed our work to a limited level of assurance in accordance with 
International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 Revised, 
Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial 
Information (effective for assurance reports dated on or after December 15, 
2015), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board.
Summary of work performed
As part of our independent verification, our work included:
1. Conducting interviews with relevant personnel of Boskalis;
2. Reviewing the data collection and consolidation processes used to compile 
the Selected Information, including assessing assumptions made, collection 
processes, and the data scope and reporting boundaries;
3. Reviewing documentary evidence produced by Boskalis;
4. Confirming the accuracy of a selection of the Selected Information to the 
corresponding source documentation;
5. Reviewing Boskalis systems for quantitative data aggregation and analysis;
6. Performing analytical procedures of the Selected Information;
7. Re-performing aggregation calculations of the Selected Information; and
8. Assessing the disclosure and presentation of the Selected Information to 
ensure consistency with assured information.
A 5% materiality threshold was applied to this assurance. It should be noted 
that the procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in 
nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance 
engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited 
assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would 
have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been 
performed.
