Our purpose
Our purpose is to master heat, 
enabling global industries to 
build sustainable modern life.
Our values 
At RHI Magnesita, we believe in an ethical 
workplace, performing our roles with integrity, 
honesty, reliability and in respectful 
collaboration with each other. Extending these 
ethical behaviours to interactions with all of our 
business partners is vital for the long-term 
sustainable success of RHI Magnesita.
Our highlights 
Recycling rate  
12.6%
2018: 3.5%
RHI Magnesita has developed proprietary 
technology for increasing the use of secondary 
raw materials with no loss in refractory 
performance. This reduces customer waste 
and eliminates CO2 emissions which would 
otherwise be released in the mining and 
processing of new raw materials. Since 2018, 
the Group has accumulated over 1Mt of  
CO2 savings.
CO2 intensity reduced by 
12%
2022: 8%
RHI Magnesita has made strong progress 
against its goal to reduce CO2 intensity by 15% 
by 2025, through improving recycling rates, 
switching to alternative fuels and increasing 
its use of electricity generated from renewable 
sources. Our 12% intensity reduction compares 
to a 2018 baseline adjusted for 2023 M&A,  
or 16% excluding M&A adjustment.
Female representation 
in senior leadership
28%
2018: 12%
RHI Magnesita seeks to improve diversity  
to create a more inclusive workplace and  
benefit from a broader range of experience  
and perspectives. Female representation at 
Board level was 29% (2022: 33%) and at 
EMT plus direct reports level gender diversity 
increased to 28% (2022: 21%), against a target 
of 33% by 2025. Board diversity will be restored 
to 33% if shareholders approve the nomination  
of Katarina Lindström to the Board at the  
2024 AGM.

Introduction
Highlights
RHI Magnesita was pleased to receive the 
“Sustainability Disclosure of the Year” award 
for its 2022 reporting from the Chartered 
Governance Institute UK & Ireland, which was 
independently judged against sustainability 
reporting published by all FTSE 250 and  
FTSE 100 index constituents. We are proud  
to maintain high standards and we have  
sought to further enhance our disclosure  
this year in line with market practice and 
developing regulations.
Key highlights include a further reduction in 
CO2 emissions intensity driven by recycling, 
investment into innovative technology solutions 
for carbon capture and utilisation, SOX and 
NOX emissions abatement and a growing 
share of procurement expenditures now 
managed through the EcoVadis ESG platform, 
to incentivise better sustainability practices 
amongst our suppliers.
The Group is undergoing a period of significant 
change with nine acquisitions completed in the 
period since December 2021. M&A presents 
us with new challenges as we extend our 
sustainable business practices into acquired 
entities, seeking to deliver “Sustainable Growth” 
for all stakeholders.
Our purpose
RHI Magnesita’s purpose is to master heat, 
enabling global industries to build sustainable 
modern life. Our advanced products are 
essential for our customers in the steel, cement, 
metals, glass, energy and chemicals industries. 
Through the reliable supply of innovative 
refractory products and services, we enable 
our customers to sustainably deliver the basic 
materials that are essential for modern life. We 
aim to be our customers’ partner of choice on 
their own decarbonisation journeys.
Our sustainability strategy
Our sustainability strategy is based on the ten 
Principles of the UN Global Compact (UNGC). 
RHI Magnesita’s sustainability strategy is 
focused on:
• Excellent workplace Health & Safety.
• Climate change and environmental impact 
mitigation.
• Increased use of secondary raw materials  
to reduce CO2 emissions.
• R&D investment to develop emissions 
avoidance, alternative fuels, and carbon 
capture, storage and utilisation technologies. 
• Partnering with our customers to reduce 
their emissions through innovative  
refractory products or solutions contract, 
including enabling technologies such as 
EAF refractories.
• Sustainable procurement practices.
• Upholding diversity in the workplace.
• Building strong relationships with all 
stakeholders including communities, 
employees and governments.
• Linking debt facilities and management 
compensation to sustainability performance.
Our 2025 targets
Our 2025 sustainability targets are based 
on engagement with internal and external 
stakeholders and encompass CO2, energy, 
recycling, diversity, Health & Safety and NOX 
and SOX emissions. 
Materiality
The Group conducts a formal materiality 
assessment every other year to define the focus 
of its sustainability management efforts and 
the content to be reported. The assessment 
identifies issues judged to have the greatest 
impact on our business, people, communities 
and the environment, and issues that matter 
most to our stakeholders.
The most recent materiality assessment was 
carried out in 2022 and reaffirmed the material 
topics identified in 2019. The assessment 
included an extensive online survey completed 
by internal stakeholders including executive 
Board members and employees and external 
stakeholders including suppliers, investors, 
customers, NGOs and business associations.
Our sustainability objectives are based on our core values. 
We believe that long-term financial success is only 
possible if we also deliver our sustainability goals.”
Herbert Cordt
Chairman
Contribution to the SDGs
We support the UN Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”) and have identified these as the goals our business is best placed to actively support.

Materiality
The assessment also considered RHI Magnesita’s 
risk management approach, to assess potential 
impacts of the material topics. The impact of 
each material topic was rated as low, medium 
or high based on the highest rating of the risk 
assessment, which considers four risk areas 
(compliance, strategy, financial, and operations) 
and the likelihood of occurrence. The potential 
impact on the Group is represented by different 
bubble sizes in the materiality matrix.
Standards, frameworks and  
scope of report
RHI Magnesita is committed to transparency 
and reports its sustainability performance 
according to leading standards and frameworks. 
In the year to December 2023 the main basis of 
our sustainability reporting is GRI Standards.

GOVERNANCE
Sustainability
Governance
Governance structure 
At Board level, a dedicated Corporate 
Sustainability Committee supports the Board, 
acting as an advisory body to ensure the long-
term sustainability of the business. The CSC 
monitors performance against relevant KPIs  
and assesses risks and opportunities associated 
with climate change, environmental, Health  
& Safety, stakeholder relations and other  
ESG risks.
At EMT level, the Chief Technology Officer is 
accountable for driving sustainable practices 
within the organisation and delivering the 
Group’s sustainability targets. The CTO 
actively engages in overseeing and integrating 
technologies and methodologies across various 
aspects of our operations. Strategic decisions and 
technological initiatives contribute significantly 
to the achievement of the Group’s sustainability 
targets, ensuring that innovation and R&D is 
aligned with our commitment to sustainability.
Reporting to the CTO, the Global Sustainability 
Team collaborates closely with the CTO and 
CSC to monitor progress against targets, advise 
on regulatory developments, compile reporting 
materials and engage with external ratings 
agencies. A collaborative approach ensures 
co-ordination with key functional areas such 
as Health & Safety, environment, sustainable 
technology and decarbonisation, recycling, 
finance, risk management and compliance, 
and procurement. This governance framework 
facilitates a comprehensive and integrated 
approach to sustainability.
At the operational level, plant managers 
and regional presidents are accountable for 
the day-to-day performance of the Group’s 
assets, including delivering progress towards 
sustainability goals. Regional presidents report 
to the Chief Customer Officer who in turn 
reports to the Chief Executive Officer. 
This governance structure combines 
transparency and accountability with  
functional expertise. 
Ethics and compliance
In 2023 we continued to embed and evolve 
our compliance policies and procedures. We 
take a zero-tolerance approach to incidents of 
fraud, bribery or corruption in our business. This 
approach is set out in our Code of Conduct, 
which was updated and re-launched in 2023, 
and in our Supplier Code of Conduct. Code 
of Conduct has been streamlined with a 
heightened emphasis on key areas, including 
business ethics, integrity, health and safety, 
anti-corruption, legal compliance, data privacy, 
sustainability, and conflict of interest avoidance. 
This revision aims to ensure stakeholders align 
with our values, incorporating feedback gathered 
from across the Group. All 114 governance 
body members and employees have been 
informed about AC policies and procedures 
and received e-learning to be completed as 
mandatory training. Region-wise breakdown 
indicates the following completion rates: Europe/
CIS/TR at 87%, China & East Asia at 99%, 
Americas (North and South America) at 93%, 
and India & West Asia at 93%. All business 
partners have acknowledged and agreed to 
the Company’s standard contract terms, which 
include adherence to both RHI Magnesita’s code 
of conduct and the supplier code of conduct. 
These documents are easily accessible through 
its website, ensuring a thorough communication 
reach to all business partners.
Comprehensive mandatory online training is 
used for topics such as business ethics, data 
privacy, and sanctions and export controls, and 
regular monitoring of completion rates ensures 
that all office-based employees, including 
new hires, are adequately trained. In 2023 a 
Human Rights module was added to the training 
syllabus and updated Business Ethics training 
was implemented to accompany the Code of 
Conduct re-launch. 
We regularly conduct compliance risk 
assessments, such as fraud risk assessments, with 
results presented to management and the Audit 
& Compliance Committee each year. The regular 
risk assessments conducted at Group, regional 
and plant level cover Compliance risks (including 
corruption risks). The plant risk assessment 
carried out in 2023 included 47 plants and 
mines (100% coverage). We use digital 
registers, workflows and employee guidelines 
to address, document and monitor conflicts of 
interest declarations, gifts and invitations, and 
community investment approvals.
Business partners (e.g. customers, sales 
intermediaries and suppliers) and transactions 
such as mergers or acquisitions are subject 
to a separate due diligence process. All sales 
agents are certified by Ethixbase360 (formerly 
TRACE International), a leading international 
organisation specialised in third-party due 
diligence solutions.
Our focus on human rights and labour rights 
is being expanded to include suppliers via a 
programme of supplier audits. In 2024, we 
will continue to strengthen our human rights 
due diligence processes within the Group and 
in the supply chain. Following recent M&A 
activity, certain German legal entities within the 
Group are now subject to the requirements of 
the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act. 
In compliance with this legislation, a Human 
Rights Officer has been appointed. The Board 
approves an annual statement in accordance 
with the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the 
California Transparency in Supply Chains Act. 
In 2023 particular attention was given to the 
integration of acquired entities in respect of 
ethics and compliance standards. Extensive 
work was conducted during M&A integration 
plans to understand the compliance culture  
of each new entity and work to harmonise  
their approach with Group practices.  
Emphasis was placed on face-to-face 
interaction and discussion to jointly evolve 
Business Ethics approaches. 
We encourage anyone with ethics or 
compliance concerns to report them to an 
independently operated hotline, which is 
confidential and can be used anonymously. 
We are firmly committed to whistleblower 
protection, including to the principle of 
non-retaliation. Reports are independently 
investigated and appropriate follow-up actions 
taken. The Audit & Compliance Committee 
receives regular data on cases submitted via  
the hotline and other channels. 
In 2023, the hotline and additional reporting 
channels generated 166 reports (versus 64 in 
2022). Out of these, eight cases are classified 
under the category ‘Bribery & Corruption’. 
All cases are investigated internally by IA, 
R&C department with external legal support 
if deemed necessary. In case a complaint 
substantiates, RHIM takes appropriate action 
to address the immediate risk and implement 
preventive actions with immediate effect. The 
significant rise in cases results primarily from  
the whistleblowing hotline being used in 
Brazil as a primary channel to escalate human 
resource related concerns. Additional cases 
were reported through recently acquired 
entities and as staff returned to working  
patterns in office locations after COVID-19 
restrictions ended.

Product carbon footprint
To increase transparency for our customers and 
to enable them to accurately calculate their own 
Scope 3 supplier emissions, the CO2 footprint  
of each of our c.200,000 refractory products  
is made available in our Customer Portal.  
The calculations adhere to the ISO 14067 
standard, encompassing “cradle-to-gate” 
greenhouse gas emissions, including raw 
material extraction and processing, refractory 
production and packaging.
The carbon footprint includes all Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 emissions and part of the Scope 3 
emissions associated with the manufacturing 
of the product. The largest share of Scope 3 
emissions arises from the purchase of refractory 
raw materials that are not sourced from within 
the Group. Limited data is available from 
suppliers for the carbon footprint of externally 
purchased raw material, although the Group 
has extensive knowledge of its own raw material 
production process. We are continuing to 
work with suppliers to refine our estimates of 
emissions from purchased raw materials.
CO2 footprint data enables us to (i) better 
address customer needs by providing the most 
suitable technical and sustainable products 
and solutions; (ii) gain a competitive edge via 
sustainability criteria in tender processes, and 
(iii) incorporate sustainability and environmental 
indicators into our product design and 
production cycles.
Low-carbon products
The progressive reduction of CO2 emissions has 
become a fundamental target for our customers 
and RHI Magnesita aims to be the preferred 
refractory partner as this transition is realised. 
We are also committed to developing a circular 
economy in the refractory industry, aiming at 
a zero-waste product life cycle to preserve 
natural resources.
RHI Magnesita has developed low-carbon 
footprint products to address both customer 
priorities: to reduce CO2 emissions whilst 
maintaining refractory performance. In 2023, 
the Group launched a new basic gunning  
mix with high recycled material content. 
Branded ANKERJET X, this low-carbon  
gunning mix achieves an 85% reduction in 
carbon footprint from refractory consumption 
with no loss of performance compared to 
conventional products. 
Increased use of recycled materials improves 
raw material availability, reduces the cost and 
resource-intensive process of raw material 
extraction and processing and significantly 
reduces CO2 emissions, with each tonne of 
recycled material used saving approximately

of CO2 savings from recycling can be found in  
the case studies on pages 66 and 67 .
Digital solutions
RHI Magnesita offers digital solutions and 
associated physical equipment which achieve 
CO2 emission reductions through process 
efficiencies, such as wear monitoring and 
gunning repairs to extend the safe working life of 
refractory linings. Safely extending the working 
life of refractory linings can achieve significant 
energy savings for steel producers by reducing 
the number of heating and cooling cycles 
required per unit of steel output.
RHI Magnesita has taken several steps in  
digital customer solutions in 2023 to reduce 
carbon emissions and promote sustainability. 
These include:
• Launching a Minimum Viable Product 
concept on its Customer Portal, which 
provides customers with access to the 
product carbon footprint and a yearly  
report on sustainable refractory materials. 
This creates initial awareness of the CO2 
footprint of refractories.
• Consolidating the Lining Evaluation  
Scan product for cement rotary kilns,  
which improves material selection and 
lifetime, reduces waste, and lowers overall 
carbon footprint.
• Supporting customers in reducing energy 
and specific refractory consumption in steel 
ladles through the Ladle Slag Model, which 
optimises the slag conditioning process.
• Applying digital solutions for the operation 
of rotary kilns in our own production plants, 
delivering production optimisation and 
efficiency gains.
• Collaborating with customers on research 
projects to minimise energy losses and 
reduce emissions.
Other solutions and products which directly 
contribute to CO2 emissions reductions at 
customer sites include cold setting mixes,  
EAF direct purging plugs and converter gas 
purging products.

ANKRAL LC Series
Containing up to 50% recycled 
materials, RHI Magnesita’s Ankral  
LC Series has been designed to help 
cement producers reduce emissions 
in their supply chain, without 
compromising technical requirements 
and specifications. 
The Group offers a circular economy 
service to transform used refractory 
bricks into valuable secondary raw 
materials. The removal process, 
pre-separation and transportation to 
recycling hubs are usually performed  
by the customer team, supported by  
RHI Magnesita recycling experts or 
partners from the Group’s MIRECO joint 
venture. At recycling hubs, chemical 
analysis, sorting and a patented cleaning 
process transform waste into usable 
secondary raw materials.
In 2023, the Ankral LC Series was 
confirmed to have equivalent 
performance to non-recycled products 
under challenging conditions:
Case Study A, Central Europe: Ankral 
LC installed in January 2022, exhibited 
uniform wear after a one year campaign. 
The product was installed in the upper 
part of the central burning zone, where 
high thermal load in combination with 
occasional clinker melt infiltration 
and coating loss are the typical wear 
mechanisms. The lining’s residual 
thickness after a one year campaign 
surpassed expectations, confirming  
its equivalent performance to other  
iron-rich central burning zone bricks  
on the market.
Case Study B, European Kiln: Ankral 
LC in the lower transition zone showed 
a comparable performance to the 
standard Ankral product after a one  
year campaign. 
The Ankral LC Series showcases a 
successful synergy of sustainability  
and performance, addressing modern 
clinker production challenges. By 
recycling used bricks into new refractory 
products, this series contributes to  
a circular economy, reduces waste,  
and minimises the carbon footprint  
in refractory production.

Sustainable Gunning Mixes
The use of RHI Magnesita’s sustainable 
gunning mixes offers potential to reduce 
customer Scope 3 emissions from 
refractory usage in steel plants. 
The customer transitioned from a 
standard basic gunning mix with a 
product carbon footprint of 1.66 tCO2e/
tprod to a recycling gunning mix with 
a significantly lower footprint of 0.979 
tCO2e/tprod. This resulted in a 42 
tonne decrease in CO2e emissions 
associated with the 62 tonnes of product 
consumed by the customer. This quantity 
of avoided emissions is comparable 
to those produced by a diesel truck 
circumnavigating the globe.
This case study illustrates the tangible 
environmental benefits that can be 
obtained through the use of sustainable 
gunning mixes and the wider potential 
for our customers to make significant CO2 
emissions savings by focusing on the 
footprint of high CO2-intensive items in 
their supply chains. As Scope 3 emissions 
become more closely analysed the 
attractiveness of low-carbon footprint 
products increases. 
Lining Evaluation Scan
RHI Magnesita offers innovative digital 
solutions designed to reduce CO2 
emissions through enhanced process 
efficiencies. Our solutions, such as wear 
monitoring and gunning repairs, extend 
the safe working life of refractory linings, 
contributing to a lower carbon footprint. 
A key component of our approach in the 
cement industry is the Lining Evaluation 
Scan for rotary kilns, which improves 
material selection and lifetime, reduces 
waste, and lowers the overall carbon 
footprint of the operation. 
The Lining Evaluation Scan addresses 
the shortcomings of current scanning 
methods for lining evaluation. Traditional 
methods, involving drilling and manual 
measurement, pose safety risks and are 
time-consuming. RHI Magnesita’s LEICA 
RTC 360 scanner revolutionises this 
process. Mounted on a specialised tripod, 
and featuring portable lighting, it ensures 
efficient and safe scanning. Equipped 
with lidar technology, the scanner swiftly 
captures detailed information, creating 
a 3D-point cloud and high-definition 
pictures simultaneously, covering a  
wide range.
The scanning process requires minimal 
preparation time and takes around 45 
minutes to map the entire kiln. A Rapid 
Evaluation Report is delivered within two 
hours, facilitating quick decision-making. 
Additionally, through the customer 
portal, the scanning system provides a 
visual representation of remaining lining 
thickness, customisable acceptable 
thickness criteria, and a comprehensive 
exploration of the lining history. This 
empowers users to make informed 
decisions about kiln maintenance, with 
graphical trends and detailed insights 
into each zone. 
With a customer-focused and innovative 
approach, RHI Magnesita underscores its 
commitment to providing solutions that 
enhance sustainability, efficiency, and 
customer satisfaction.

Our suppliers
RHI Magnesita’s top 20 suppliers account for 
approximately 20% of our expenditure and the 
top 200 around 55%. Procurement extends to 
suppliers producing refractory raw materials, 
energy suppliers facilitating the conversion of 
raw materials to finished products, transport 
suppliers, and manufacturing suppliers. 
While contractual commitments generally 
do not exceed one year, the Group may enter 
into longer contracts on an exception bases 
for critical raw materials and energy. Our 
operational focus is on capital and energy 
intensive processes, especially in equipment for 
raw material and finished product production. 
Most specific raw materials are sourced from 
China, resulting in a lengthy supply chain. 
Procurement spending in our industry equates 
to about two-thirds of revenue, on average.
Despite a high reliance on Chinese raw 
materials in the broader refractory industry, 
RHI Magnesita’s suppliers are predominantly 
situated in the regions where its production 
facilities operate. Europe leads in supplier 
concentration, followed by China, Brazil, 
the USA, and India. In our commitment to 
sustainable procurement, RHI Magnesita  
aims to integrate sustainability priorities  
into our procurement processes.
Supply chain due diligence
Since 2022, RHI Magnesita has established  
a framework for supply chain due diligence,  
to ensure ethical and compliant practices across 
the Group’s supplier network. A comprehensive 
Supplier Code of Conduct outlines the 
standards and expectations the Group holds 
for all partners in the supply chain. Supplier 
desktop evaluations and on-site inspections  
are also used to proactively identify and address 
any potential risks, fostering a sustainable and 
resilient supply chain.
Supplier Code of Conduct
The Supplier Code of Conduct requires 
suppliers to follow the same principles as set  
out in RHI Magnesita’s own Code of Conduct.  
It is distributed to all suppliers who are required 
to confirm compliance.
Supplier assessments through EcoVadis
An assessment system developed with 
EcoVadis is used to rate potential suppliers for 
sustainability impacts such as energy use, CO2 
emissions and waste. The ratings resulting from 
this assessment form an important part of the 
Group’s procurement decision-making process. 
The initial phase of supplier assessments was 
started in 2021 based on contract size and risk 
mapping. The process has continued in 2023, 
now covering 41% of spend. Our target is to 
cover two-thirds of the supplier base by spend 
by 2025, including all suppliers delivering raw 
materials with a high CO2 intensity.
Supplier on-site assessments
The Group conducts on-site assessments to 
evaluate suppliers based on product quality, 
Health & Safety and ESG aspects.1 In 2023, 
RHI Magnesita has significantly increased the 
number of on-site assessments to 42, compared 
to nine in 2022. The assessments were 
conducted worldwide, including 16 in India  
and ten in China.
Supplier product carbon footprint 
Since the contribution of raw material extraction 
and processing is the largest single source of 
CO2 emissions in the refractory value chain, 
the Group is seeking to increase the accuracy 
of its supplier CO2 emissions data. In 2023 
our specific focus with selected raw material 
suppliers included raising their awareness of 
our data requirements and providing support 
on the required calculation methodology. 
Accurate information enables the Group to 
prioritise suppliers with lower emissions in order 
to minimise Scope 3 emissions. Engagement on 
the subject of emissions also demonstrates to 
potential suppliers that CO2 reduction is a key 
priority for the Group, which is expected to drive 
long-term changes in supplier behaviour and 
energy use. 
Supplier collaboration
RHI Magnesita is committed to shaping a 
more resilient and sustainable supply chain. 
Therefore, the Group seeks collaborations  
with strategic suppliers to create more 
sustainable goods and services, with lower 
environmental impact. Several collaborations in 
2023 resulted in projects with positive impacts 
such as emission reduction in our packaging 
materials and optimisation of transport routes  
to reduce emissions.

 CASE STUDY – SUPPLIER ENGAGEMENT
Recycled Packaging Solutions
Suitable packaging materials are essential 
to ensuring the safe transportation of our 
products whilst protecting them from damage. 
We are committed to continuously improving 
the efficiency of the materials and products 
which we use in our packaging process. 
With this aim in mind RHI Magnesita launched 
a project to increase the use of recycled 
plastic (“PCR” or Post-Consumer-Recycled) 
in its packaging materials, resulting in multiple 
benefits from a sustainability perspective. 
Firstly, increasing the share of recycled 
content leads to lower greenhouse gas 
emissions and energy consumption  
associated with the packaging life cycle. 
Secondly, the introduction of recycled 
materials results in a reduction of the 
amount of waste that ends up in landfills or 
incinerators, which reduces the negative 
impact on the environment. 
The project included two different types of 
packaging materials: stretchfoils and big bags. 
A stretchfoil is a thin plastic film stretched 
around our finished shaped refractory 
products to ensure safe transport. Big bags 
are used in the transportation of unshaped 
products. The goal of the project was to 
convert the entire stretchfoil and big bag 
demand in Europe to 30% PCR content while 
preventing any potential negative impacts 
on the packaging process or transport safety. 
Following collaboration between the Group 
and its suppliers, new packaging materials 
were successfully developed and tested to 
fulfil our high-quality standards. 
Since Q4 2023 for stretch foil and from the 
beginning of 2024 for big bags (up to 1.5t), 
packaging for products manufactured in 
Europe must now contain a minimum 30% 
of recycled plastic. The CO2 savings from this 
change are calculated to be 480 tonnes per 
year (an equivalent of 54 homes energy use 
for one year) and total emissions from these 
materials has reduced by 23%.
The project to increase the use of recycled 
content in product packaging has been 
a successful initiative that has improved 
our environmental performance and 
strengthened our relationships with  
our suppliers.

Tackling Climate Change
Driving down carbon emissions is a key priority 
for RHI Magnesita. In addition to charting our 
own transition, we want to be a trusted partner 
to our customers on their journey to a low-
carbon economy.
The Group’s emission reduction plans target 
a 15% reduction in CO2 emissions intensity for 
Scope 1, 2 and 3 (raw materials) emissions by 
2025, compared to 2018. Our climate strategy 
is based on:
1) reducing the carbon footprint of our raw 
materials, including through the increased 
use of circular raw materials; 
2) increasing energy efficiency in our 
operations; 
3) reducing the carbon intensity of our  
energy sources; and 
4) providing innovative solutions to reduce 
customer emissions. 
In 2023, total CO2 emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 
3 - raw materials) were 4.6 million tonnes and 
our emissions intensity has reduced by 12%. 
Since the baseline year of 2018, the Group has 
exceeded its initial targets in recycling, offset 
by delayed progress in switching to alternative 
fuels. Biofuel switches have progressed but 
the original strategy to convert from solid fuels 
to natural gas is now being reassessed due to 
capital expenditure constraints, infrastructure 
availability, changes in the market outlook for 
natural gas and new possibilities for cost-
effective carbon capture and sequestration 
which offer much higher CO2 savings. 
Achieving our short term objectives is  
therefore reliant on the continued success  
of our recycling initiatives.
The Group is currently pursuing a substantial 
M&A programme, in line with its growth 
objectives. In the short term, acquisitions can 
present a potential downside for sustainability 
targets such as recycling rates or CO2  
emissions intensity until they are integrated. 
Harmonising diverse standards, supply chains, 
and operational processes poses challenges 
and can affect overall environmental KPIs in  
the short term. To mitigate this impact, the 
Group seeks to align sustainability practices  
and implement efficient transition strategies  
as soon as possible following acquisition.  
A comprehensive disclosure of our climate 
governance, strategy, and risk assessment can 
be found in the Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) on pages 40-46 
of this report.
Decarbonisation of refractory 
production
Refractory production is a ‘hard to abate’ 
industry. Raw material processing generally 
uses fossil fuels for ignition and burning of 
carbonate rock, which results in significant 
geogenic CO2 emissions. These geogenic 
emissions are classified as Scope 1 when 
resulting from the Group’s own production or 
Scope 3 in the case of externally purchased  
raw materials.
Significant energy is also required for firing 
of products in the refractory manufacturing 
stage. Further emissions are generated in the 
shipping and distribution of refractory products 
to customers worldwide. 
Through its investment in research and 
development of emissions avoidance or 
reduction technologies, the Group has 
developed a theoretical pathway to decrease its 
Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 (raw materials) 
carbon emissions from refractory production to 
close to zero. The required measures have been 
prioritised in order of deliverability, with those 
items that are fully within the control of the 
Group to be expedited. 
The first stage of CO2 emissions reduction 
is to be delivered through measures which 
can be implemented by the Group without 
significant external support, including 
increased use of recycled raw materials, fuel 
switches and energy efficiency measures. It is 
estimated that these measures could deliver 
an absolute reduction of around one and half 
million tonnes of CO2 emissions, or 24% of 
the baseline total by 2035. Beyond this initial 
reduction, decarbonisation measures become 
progressively harder to deliver. Recycling has a 
natural ceiling since refractories are consumed 
during use and only residual materials can be 
reclaimed, whilst fuel switches to natural gas 
only offer a partial reduction. The pathway for 
stages 2 to 4 is reliant on the provision of (i) new 
infrastructure or renewable energy sources 
such as hydrogen by outside parties; (ii) the 
use of technologies which do not yet exist or 
are not proven at pilot or production scale; and

(iii) significant capital expenditure, which may 
not be possible for the Group to generate from 
its existing operations, obtain from its finance 
providers or receive via government funding.
The costs of emitting carbon, which could 
provide an incentive to accept higher capital 
expenditure and operating costs for the 
purposes of reducing CO2 emissions, apply 
in certain jurisdictions and may provide a 
business case for reducing emissions in those 
geographies. Estimates of future potential 
CO2 costs are built into the Group’s financial 
forecasts and planning decisions. However, the 
Group has a global production and customer 
network and competes with other refractory 
producers who are not subject to additional  
CO2 costs.
Our decarbonisation commitment
Working within these limitations, the Group  
is committed to:
1. Leading the refractory industry by 
decarbonising its operations as fast  
as sustainably possible.
2. Annually updating its decarbonisation 
pathway based on the latest developments 
in technology, infrastructure and estimated 
capital expenditure.
3. Continuing to invest in the development of 
new technologies to avoid CO2 emissions, 
proving our technical readiness to use 
alternative low-carbon energy sources  
and to capture CO2 emissions for storage  
or utilisation.
4. Offering our customers enabling 
technologies for their own low-carbon 
production technologies together with low-
carbon products and solutions contracts 
(with full transparency on carbon footprint) 
to enable them to reduce their Scope 3 CO2 
emissions from the purchase of refractories.
5. Lobbying governments to invest in the 
necessary infrastructure to decarbonise 
the refractory industry and other energy 
intensive industries, including additional 
renewable energy generation, hydrogen 
supply networks, CO2 transportation and 
storage and carbon capture and utilisation 
technologies.
6. Working with partners in the private sector 
to develop new renewable energy solutions, 
hydrogen energy networks and carbon 
capture and utilisation technologies.
Offsetting carbon emissions 
The Group has significant CO2 emissions 
within its own value chain and there are large 
emissions savings that can be delivered for 
its customers through improved solutions 
contracts or other solutions. The Board therefore 
considers that the priority should be to allocate 
capital and other resources to reducing the 
Group’s own CO2 footprint and the emissions 
of its customers rather than investing in carbon 
offset projects. The Board believes that taking 
this approach will deliver a faster, greater and 
more sustainable decrease in net CO2 emissions 
than could be delivered by allocating capital  
to offsets.

Recycling and the circular economy
RHI Magnesita maintains its industry leadership 
in utilising recycled minerals and recycling has 
been the major contributor to the Group’s CO2 
emissions reductions to date. For every tonne 
of recycled refractory material that is re-used, 
approximately 1.5 tonnes of CO2 emissions are 
avoided compared to the processing of virgin 
raw material. Recycling is the most effective 
route to reduce CO2 emissions in the short term 
towards our 2025 emissions intensity target.
Recycling also has significant waste 
management and circular economy benefits  
for our customers. 
Historically, recycling rates for refractories 
were low due to reduced performance levels 
for finished products containing reclaimed 
materials. RHI Magnesita has now demonstrated 
using its innovative processes to improve purity 
and real-world operational examples that 
recycled materials can now be incorporated 
without compromising refractory performance.
In 2023, the Company achieved a recycling 
rate of 12.6%, representing a 20% increase 
from 2022. This significant progress has been 
driven by continuous efforts and substantial 
investments in recycling infrastructure and 
translates to a CO2 saving of 393 ktpa.
Over €4 million has been invested in capital 
expenditure projects related to recycling to 
date, focused on adopting new technologies 
and upgrading collection, sorting and  
storage facilities. 
Having achieved the initial recycling rate  
target of 10% three years early, the Group  
has now adopted a new target of 15% by  
2025. Recycling has a natural ceiling since 
refractories are largely consumed during use 
and only residual materials can be reclaimed. 
In the short term recycling rates will also be 
reduced following the addition of multiple  
new acquisitions to the Group, with lower  
levels of recycling usage compared to the 
Group average. 
CERO-Waste concept and regional 
initiatives
In the SAM region, RHI Magnesita achieved  
a 10% increase in recycling utilisation in  
2023 through collaborative efforts between 
technical, operational and sales teams to 
develop and market products with high 
recycled content. A recognition campaign  
was also launched to acknowledge customers 
in the region who are most active in the 
collection of spent refractories. 
In Europe, recycled material consumption 
also increased by 10%, incorporating 70kt 
through MIRECO-supported initiatives such 
as the ‘CERO-Waste’ concept and new R&D 
developments.
In North America, dedicated efforts to 
strengthen partnerships with customers and 
suppliers and the promotion of high-recycling 
content products delivered a 50% increase 
in secondary raw material usage. The NAM 
product portfolio now contains brands with 
between 20%-100% recycled materials, 
reducing the CO2 footprint by up to 85%.
In China RHI Magnesita increased recycled 
material consumption by over 15%, with  
new products marketed to both steel and 
industrial customers.
India also increased secondary raw material 
usage by 15%, driven by the sales team focus

on prioritising products with recycled content. 
Following M&A completed in 2023, the region’s 
production capacity has increased significantly 
and new acquisitions will now be integrated into 
the Group’s recycling activities.
Technical teams continue to innovate with over 
100 recycling-related product developments, 
tailoring products for optimal performance and 
maximising circular mineral usage.
The Ankral LC series, initially created in Europe, 
has expanded into SAM, addressing both 
cement and lime markets with brands that 
deliver a CO2 footprint up to 25% lower than 
original brands, decreasing scope 3 emissions 
for our customers. For further details on Ankral 
LC see case study on page 8 of this report.
On the processing side, the Group had 15 active 
R&D projects in 2023 focused on enhancing 
circular material quality and availability. Notable 
achievements include the processing of 
Magnesia-Carbon recycled brick material in the 
Breitenau raw material kiln in Austria, obtaining 
a new high-quality MgO recycled raw material.
In Brazil, two innovative technologies were 
implemented to address material treatment 
from the steel industry and the removal of 
infiltrations in circular materials from the cement 
industry, increasing quality and stability of the 
end product.
ReSoURCE - Innovative solution  
in refractory recycling
In 2022, the Group initiated the ReSoURCE 
project, a 42 month initiative under the Horizon 
Europe framework. As project coordinator, 
RHI Magnesita leads technical framing and 
coordination, focusing on automated multi-
sensor-based sorting for the refractory industry.
The project aims to develop reliable, robust 
automated sorting solutions with high accuracy 
for spent refractories, validated sustainability 
benefits, and facilitation of material usage for 
alternative products. The initiative accelerates 
RHI Magnesita’s own technology development, 
whilst contributing to improved sustainability for 
the wider refractory industry.
Achieving the ReSoURCE project goals would 
deliver the following benefits:
• 800 ktpa reduction in CO2 emissions.
• 760 GWh energy saving per year.
• Conservation of 800 ktpa of landfill  
waste capacity.
• Digital and robotic transformation of  
manual processes.
• Workforce upskilling.
• Reinforcement of the EU’s raw material 
supply chain resilience.
Progress in 2023 included detailed  
examination of raw material feedstocks, 
adapting sensor setups for spent refractory 
sorting and establishing classification 
criteria. In 2024 the first demonstrator will 
be commissioned, intended to sort up to 10 
tons of waste material per hour at the Group’s 
facility in Mitterdorf, Austria, marking a pivotal 
step towards automation of the sorting process 
chain. Learn more about the ReSoURCE  
project here.
Sustainable Technology
Partnership and industry co-operation 
The Group continues to build partnerships 
with start-ups, universities, and industrial 
companies outside the refractory sector to 
expand its network and learnings in the field 
of decarbonisation. These include the K1-MET 
consortium with the Austrian steel industry and 
the Industrial Advisory Board of the EU-funded 
MOF4AIR project, a development of new 
materials for capturing CO2 using membranes. 
RHI Magnesita also has a collaborative program 
with the University of Leoben focused on 
carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) 
technologies, which is carrying out research to 
explore the viability and potential applications 
of different CCUS technologies.
RHI Magnesita is proactively positioning itself for 
the potential use of hydrogen as an alternative 
fuel to deliver the future decarbonisation of 
high-temperature industrial processes which 
currently use fossil fuels. As a participant in the 
Hydrogen Import Alliance Austria, the Group’s 
primary focus to ensure reliable access to 
hydrogen in the coming years. 
Aligning with key customers in the cement, 
steel, and chemical industries who share similar 
challenges, we collectively strive to develop and 
implement innovative technologies. Discussions 
around the future development of industrial 
hubs capable of leveraging CO2 utilisation and 
pipeline access for hydrogen and CO2 transport 
are ongoing, with the aim of delivering broad 
benefits across diverse industries. 
The potential to produce Green Hydrogen 
on site is being examined. However, large-
scale production with regional distribution, 
and importation via pipelines is likely to be 
a more efficient solution in the long run. If 
national and regional plans unfold as expected, 
RHI Magnesita anticipates having access to 
hydrogen and CO2 pipelines in the early 2030s.
Carbon capture and utilisation 
In 2023, further progress has been made in 
the evaluation of technologies for CO2 capture 
at the Group’s raw material production sites. 
Research of potential technology solutions 
includes cryogenic, chemical separation, and 
membrane-based techniques. The Group has 
acquired equipment for CO2 capture through 
membrane separation intended for installation  
at its Breitenau plant in Austria in 2024.

Understanding our reduction measures
18 RHI MAGNESITA  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023
OUR PLANET
In the area of Carbon Capture and Utilisation 
(CCU), the Group has agreed a partnership with 
MCi Carbon to develop technologies focused on 
the direct mineralisation of CO2 from flue gases, 
through a process which can efficiently transform 
gaseous waste CO2 into a solid mineral. The MCi 
process offers opportunities for utilisation in other 
industries, such as the cement sector, which 
faces similar challenges with process emissions 
of CO2 not originating from the use of fossil fuels. 
2023 activity was concentrated on locating and 
assessing potential raw materials to use in the 
mineralisation process. Testing and development 
programmes with MCi Carbon are set to continue 
until mid-2025.
Alternative fuels including hydrogen  
and biofuels 
Hydrogen produced using renewable energy 
is a promising alternative fuel for use in high 
temperature industrial processes such as those 
undertaken by RHI Magnesita. The Group is 
actively addressing the technical challenges 
associated with the use of hydrogen in its plants 
and new concepts are being developed for 
measurement, transportation, storage and firing 
to prepare for a future shift to hydrogen use. The 
first pilot project to evaluate the use of hydrogen 
in a refractory plant is planned to commence at 
Marktredwitz in the fourth quarter of 2024.
A comprehensive evaluation is also underway 
to assess the feasibility of generating hydrogen 
on-site at the Group’s own facilities. Initial 
conclusions are that on-site production would 
be highly capital intensive and therefore 
unlikely to be economic unless supported  
by public subsidies. 
If hydrogen is not generated on-site, securing a 
reliable and economic supply of green hydrogen 
would be an essential pre-cursor to large scale 
adoption of hydrogen use in quantities that 
would make a material difference to the Group’s 
Scope 1 emissions. 
RHI Magnesita is also exploring other non-fossil 
fuel options including biofuels. In Q4 2023, 
the Breitenau raw material plant in Austria 
conducted successful trials using sunflower 
husks as a supplementary non-fossil fuel. 
Further trials with this fuel source will be 
undertaken in 2024 to assess the practical 
operation of the kiln and any impacts on raw 
material quality.
Environment
Energy mix
Currently, natural gas provides approximately 
40% of the Group’s total energy usage, with 
coal and heavy oil the next largest sources, 
followed by diesel, gasoline, LPG, light fuel 
and propane. The Groups is assessing all 
possibilities to strategically increase the share  
of renewables (currently at 8%, considering 
green electricity and charcoal) in its energy 
mix, to create a more sustainable and diversified 
energy portfolio. 
Reducing the carbon intensity of energy 
RHI Magnesita is seeking to reduce the carbon 
intensity of its energy sources through switching 
to lower intensity alternatives where possible. 
In Europe, plans to transition from CO2 intensive 
petroleum coke to more CO2 efficient natural 
gas in our plants have been postponed due 
to delays in natural gas pipeline construction. 
Exploring biofuels as an alternative is 
dependent upon local availability and cost 
competitiveness. We continue to monitor 
energy markets and alternative fuel sources  
to reduce emissions.
At the Ponte Alta raw material production site 
in Brazil we have successfully switched away 
from petroleum coke to sustainably sourced 
charcoal. In 2023 this delivered 11kt of CO2 
emissions compared to petroleum coke use 
(2022: 18kt).
We continue to reduce the CO2 intensity of 
purchased electricity. In 2023, we established 
a fully green electricity supply for our German 
recycling plants and at the Sögüt plant in 
Türkiye. At Visakhapatnam, India, 0.5 MW of 
photovoltaic capacity was installed, resulting in 
a CO2 reduction of around 500t CO2 per year. 
The Group is investigating the potential for solar 
generation at several other sites. By the end of 
2023, 64% of purchased electricity was from 
low-carbon or renewable sources.
Energy use
In 2023, RHI Magnesita consumed 5,055 
GWh of energy, an absolute decrease of 
approximately 7% compared to the prior year. 
(2022: 5,423GWh). The main reason for lower 
energy consumption was a lower production 
volume in 2023 compared to 2022.
The Group has a target to reduce its energy 
intensity by 5% by 2025 compared to 2018.

OUR PLANET
Energy use from 
non-renewable sources 92%
Energy use from 
renewable sources 8%
Water consumption 
in non-scarce areas 84%
Water consumption 
in water scarce areas 16%
In 2023, energy intensity decreased by 6% 
compared to 2022 and was 8% lower compared 
to 2018, exceeding the target. The energy 
intensity KPI is affected by M&A, changes to the 
extent of vertical integration and product mix 
changes (e.g. production of flow control and 
shaped products consumes more energy ). 
Energy efficiency measures in Hochfilzen, 
Austria resulted in 21 GWh of energy savings. 
In Tlalnepantla, Mexico the capture of waste 
heat from the tunnel kiln saved 350 MWh. 
Across all ISO 50001 plants, improvements 
made to compressed air systems result in 1 GWh 
of energy saving and other energy efficiency 
measures resulted in 33 GWh of energy savings. 
We are continuing to roll out ISO 50001 
standards across all operations and by end of 
2023, 38% of energy was consumed at plants 
which have implemented ISO 50001. 88% 
of energy consumption was used for heating 
and 12% for electricity. No steam is used in 
our production process and for cooling, some 
climate-chambers are in use for ISO-production 
that is reported under electricity.
Reducing NOX and SOX emissions 
The Group has a target to reduce nitrogen oxide 
(NOX) and sulphur oxide (SOX) emissions by 
30% by 2025 compared to 2018. The target 
was achieved in China in 2021 and recent focus 
has been in North America, where we have 
realised the 30% reduction goal for NOX in by 
implementing a two-stage combustion process 
in the rotary kilns at the largest plant in the 
region. The North America SOX reduction target 
has also been achieved, with DeSOX equipment 
now operational and delivering almost a 50% 
reduction of emissions compared to 2018.
Waste management
Applying the principles of a circular economy 
is key for our waste management approach, 
shifting away from the linear take-make-waste 
model, minimising environmental impact. 
In 2023, our production sites generated 7kt 
hazardous and 84kt of non-hazardous waste, 
By fostering a circular economy mindset, we 
can not only mitigate the environmental impact 
but also contribute to a more resilient and 
responsible industrial landscape.
Water stewardship
RHI Magnesita’s production processes are not 
inherently water-intensive. In 2023 the Group 
withdrew 12,400 megalitres of water. 92% 
of water comes from underground sources, 
followed by third party water. Around 16% of 
this consumption occurred in areas considered 
to be at risk of possible water scarcity. The 
Group has updated its water risk assessment,  
to include newly acquired in 2023. 
The Group takes steps to reduce its water 
consumption where possible. In India, Bhiwadi 
plant installed a sewage treatment system 
to recycle domestic wastewater, utilising 
reclaimed water for on-site irrigation.
Protecting biodiversity 
The Group is dedicated to preserving 
biodiversity at its operational sites and is 
actively working to minimise its impacts. A new 
screening of biodiversity risks was conducted in 
H2 2023 and further assessments are planned 
for 2024 at the Group’s key mining sites to 
provide a more detailed understanding of 
biodiversity risks or potential dependencies. 
At the Brumado mine and raw material 
processing site in Brazil, the Group adheres 
to licence requirements to restore land to 
its original state after use. This includes the 
planting of native vegetation, which must match 
species found in the local area. For this purpose 
and to provide broader community benefits, 
over 20,000 seedlings were cultivated at the 
on-site nursery and planted both within and 
outside RHI Magnesita properties by employees 
and community members in 2023. Over 1,000 
trees were planted near the Bhiwadi, India, and 
Eskisehir, Türkiye plants and across various local 
initiatives the Group planted a total of 7,000 
trees in 2023.

Reforestation and water safeguarding
RHI Magnesita is committed to 
environmental recovery and protection 
in the Brumado region of Brazil, where it 
operates a magnesite based raw material 
production facility and open cast mine.
Through the Degraded Areas Recovery 
Project (“PRADA”), the Group has 
demonstrated its dedication to restoring 
ecological balance, in compliance with 
environmental legislation and as part of  
its commitment to the responsible 
extraction of natural resources.
Developed by a multidisciplinary 
team, PRADA focuses on reforestation 
and rehabilitation of areas previously 
impacted by mining activities. Over 
a six-month period, RHI Magnesita 
implemented maintenance and 
stabilisation actions for recovered  
areas, including the direct planting 
of native seedlings. The process for 
effective seedling planting involves 
clearing, mounding, monitoring, insect 
control and the application of fertiliser  
and hydrating gel.
Compensatory planting over a  
recovered area of 9 hectares included 
over 18,000 seedlings of 35 different 
species. Of these, five species are 
consider by law as protected or  
immune to cutting, necessitating  
greater compensatory planting. 
Anadenanthera macrocarpa (angico), 
Handroanthus spongiosus (sete casca), 
and Spondias tuberosa (umbuzeiro)  
were planted in a 15:1 compensation  
ratio as required by legislation.
The Serra das Éguas area, home to 
RHIM Magnesita’s Brumado facility, 
encompasses 22 water springs. 
RHI Magnesita acknowledges, protects 
and recovers if necessary these 
water resources. Our comprehensive 
environmental strategies aim to  
preserve water sources to ensure that 
ecological balance is maintained in  
the local area.

Health and safety
Maintaining a safe and healthy workplace 
is fundamental to RHI Magnesita’s culture 
and mindset. The Group assigns the highest 
importance to the health and safety of its 
employees and contractors. Our operations 
by necessity involve hazardous and higher risk 
activities and maintaining high safety standards 
is a minimum expectation for all stakeholders.
Our approach to safety centres on people and 
safe work practices, seeking to promote a safety-
oriented mindset based on clear operating 
procedures and management of key risks. 
New joiners including contractors are trained 
according to RHI Magnesita’s safety principles, 
which underline the shared responsibility to 
contribute to safety at work.
To deliver continuous improvement in our safety 
culture and performance, we monitor leading 
indicators in addition to key trailing performance 
indicators including Lost Time Injury Frequency 
(“LTIF”) and Total Recordable Injury Frequency 
(“TRIF”) – Total Recordable Injury Frequency. 
Assessing trends and parameters guides future 
improvement initiatives.
Safety performance 
LTIF improved to 0.16 (2022: 0.20), 
representing a downward trend since 2021  
and the lowest level of lost time injuries since 
the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.
A fatal incident occurred at one of the Group’s 
plants in Austria in November 2023 during 
material handling. A thorough investigation of 
the root causes of this incident has been carried 
out and changes to operating procedures and 
standards are being implemented worldwide 
to prevent recurrence. Based on a detailed 
analysis of the circumstances and underlying 
causes of the incident, ‘lessons learned’ have 
been communicated globally. Senior leaders 
are committed and engaged in the follow up 
and operational sites will receive further tools to 
audit compliance with operating procedures.
A fatal accident occurred at the Breitenau  
mine in Austria due to rock fall in February 
2024. Consideration of this incident and  
follow up measures was ongoing as at the  
date of this document
RHI Magnesita encourages a culture of 
communication, benchmarking and knowledge 
sharing across its regional business units which 
is underpinned by regional Health & Safety 
coordination and execution. Following any 
major incident, including those resulting in 
serious injuries or a fatality, or that are defined 
as potentially life-threatening or life-changing, 
detailed analysis of root causes is carried out and 
appropriate countermeasures implemented.
During 2023 we continued to progress 
our existing occupational health & safety 
programmes, seeking to balance leading and 
lagging indicators in order to be more pro-
active in the prevention of incidents before they 
occur. Leading indicators assist our leaders and 
employees in understanding the strengths and 
weaknesses of their safety performance, giving 
direction and insights into the typical behaviours 
and conditions that usually precede any incident. 
The Group closely monitors its Preventive 
Rate, which indicates the number of reported 
near-misses or unsafe situations per person, 
which remained stable in 2023 but at a high 
level compared to previous years. The Group 
also monitors the closing rate of actions that are 
assigned to prevent repeat accidents caused by 
similar unsafe situations. The actions closing rate 
increased to 93% in 2023 (2022: 88%).
RHI Magnesita Global Health  
and Safety Guidelines
RHI Magnesita is a manufacturer of refractories 
operating 47 refractory and raw material 
production facilities worldwide as well as 
providing services at customer sites. To 
manage Health & Safety on a global basis 
the Group has developed a set of mandatory 
Global Guidelines as part of its Health & Safety 
Management System. The Global Guidelines 
are regularly reviewed and updated to consider 
best practices and learnings from incidents  
as well as from internal and external audits  
for ISO 45001. Every employee or contractor 
who works within the Group at a controlled 
location is expected to comply with the  
Global Guidelines.

Workplace risk assessments
RHI Magnesita’s business includes high-risk 
activities for which hazard identification and risk 
assessments are carried out, documented, and 
shared. Following a continuous improvement 
approach, the Group performs risk assessments 
in multidisciplinary teams which include 
team leaders, workplace personnel, local 
health & safety experts and locally assigned 
occupational health or occupational physician 
representatives and worker representatives, 
depending on local legal requirements. 
A “Hierarchy of Controls” approach is applied to 
the risk assessment process, including but not 
limited to:
• Assessing whether the risk can be 
eliminated, e.g. purchasing equipment 
which is not noisy.
• Implementation of engineered solutions to 
eliminate or reduce the risk, e.g. automated 
processes which reduce manual work.
• Organisational measures, such as training 
and auditing.
• Standard operating procedures and work 
instructions defined with the involvement 
of the team who performs the task, with 
illustrations and in local languages.
• Providing personal protective equipment 
according RHIM global minimum standard  
to employees.
Corrective and preventive actions and further 
upgrades identified by the risk assessment  
are documented.
RHI Magnesita provides training on safety 
awareness and a “Stop Work” procedure, which 
leads to the application of a pre-defined “Quick 
Check” for assessing unsafe situations. A “Quick 
Check” can either be carried out directly by the 
worker assigned to the task or there can be a call 
for further support.
All employees and contractors are required 
to immediately report any “Unsafe Situation” 
to supervisors so that corrective actions can 
be put in place to avert harm. Both “Unsafe 
Situation” information and a report of a near miss 
are flagged in RHI Magnesita’s safety reporting 
system for further follow-up and analysis.
Occupational health
In addition to prevention of workplace 
accidents, RHI Magnesita seeks to safeguard the 
long term health and wellbeing of its people.
A variety of measures and programmes are in 
place to establish a safe work environment with 
minimal potential adverse effects on health  
and wellbeing.
Occupational health aspects are covered in 
risk assessments of workplaces which include 
areas such as noise monitoring and emissions 
of volatile organic compounds or dust. To fulfil 
local legal obligations and the Group procedure 
for Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment 
the participation of an Occupational Physician 
is obligatory.
Healthcare, health awareness campaigns 
and medical support are made available for 
operational teams, often managed locally 
according legal or regulatory obligations. 
Sustainability
Our people continued It’s our goal that everyone returns home from  
work safe and sound. Everyday.” 
Stefan Borgas 
Chief Executive Officer
For all employees, including office locations, 
RHI Magnesita also provides awareness and 
information campaigns for common illness 
and health issues such as nutrition, hydration, 
ergonomics, and other medical screenings.
RHI Magnesita reports on frequency-rates 
based on 200,000 hours worked, considering 
the LTIs – Lost Time Injuries (37 cases in 2023) 
and TRI – Total Recordable Injuries (105 
cases for 2023), – including employees and 
non-employees (temporary workers/leased 
personnel, contractors). Thereof, 1 fatality 
(temporary worker) and 2 high-consequence 
workrelated injuries (employee) are considered 
in the LTIF and TRIF. The fatal accident rate 
(FAR) for RHIM Group results in 0.004 per 
200,000 hrs whereas the FAR calculated 
for the affected category of workers is at 0.01 
per 200,000 hrs worked. The calculation of 
the rate for “High consequence work-related 
injuries, incl. fatalities” (2 high consequence-
cases and 1 fatality) gives back the groupwide 
result of 0.013 and for the affected category of 
“Employees and temporary workers” at 0.015.
Global standardisation for health  
and safety excellence
Standardisation is an effective tool to improve 
health & safety performance. RHI Magnesita 
has a global Health & Safety Management 
System and seeks certification through external 
auditors. Safety aspects are also incorporated 
into standard operating procedures. 
The following locations achieved a successful 
initial certification against ISO 45001 
Occupational Health & Safety Management 
System in 2023:
• Jinan New Emei Plant in Shandong, China.
• Regional headquarters in Shanghai, China. 
• RHIM Trading Co Ltd. based in Dalian, China. 
RHI Magnesita health and safety guidelines 
and standards were implemented in newly 
acquired facilities in China (Jinan New Emei) 
and India (five plants) during 2023. Due to 
the ongoing expansion of Group’s production 
network, the integration of other plants has also 
commenced. We seek to engage with local 
senior management and the workforce from 
the beginning to ensure that our values and 
standards are adopted.

In 2018, we introduced the “culture champions” 
network with over 60 employees worldwide 
engaging with colleagues on a regular basis 
to promote our corporate culture and this work 
continued in 2023. The Group also promoted 
unconscious bias training which addresses 
biases that may impact decision making.
Developing our leaders 
Developing an internal talent pool of future 
leaders has always been a key focus at 
RHI Magnesita and we are building our 
leadership pipeline through strategic 
succession management. Succession planning 
secures a sustainable pipeline of internal high 
performers for our most senior and critical 
positions, which also includes future female 
leaders. With a global footprint, we aim to 
reflect the geographic diversity of our business 
and we have appointed female leaders to senior 
roles in each of our five regions. We also seek 
to increase representation from different age 
groups to enable us to benefit from a multi-
generational workforce. 
Through our global trainee programme, we aim 
to attract and retain young talent as the future 
leaders of our business. In 2023, we introduced 
a third cohort of global trainees with a 60% 
female intake. On average, female representation 
in the three most recent trainee cohorts is 50%.
In 2023, we submitted a report to the FTSE 
Women Leaders Review, an independent, 
business-driven framework providing 
recommendations to enhance the 
representation of women on the Boards  
and Leadership teams of the FTSE 350 and  
50 of the UK’s largest private companies.
Our new Leadership Onboarding Programme 
equips managers with all the necessary 
attributes of a leader at RHI Magnesita, covering 
leadership principles, change management, 
general business acumen and systems  
and tools.
Building a diverse and inclusive 
workforce 
At RHI Magnesita we want to reflect the diversity 
of the world around us and to be a company  
that is open to receiving the best and brightest 
talent the world has to offer. Diversity is 
embedded in our corporate culture. We believe 
that an inclusive workplace and employee 
experience covers all aspects of diversity: age, 
gender, race, ethnic minority, LGBTQIA+ and 
persons with disabilities.
In 2023, the Group introduced a new Gender 
Equality Policy. Our Diversity, Equity, and 
Inclusion (DEI) committee meets regularly to co-
ordinate the creation of a workplace that values 
and supports individuals of all backgrounds.
We want our business to be innovative and 
productive so we can deliver the best products 
and services to our customers, and we need 
diversity to help us achieve this. Our diversity 
and inclusion strategy provides us with a road 
map to create an inclusive workplace.
Gender diversity
As part of the Group’s ongoing efforts to 
promote gender diversity, a partnership with 
Female Factor has been established to boost 
leadership skills and confidence among our 
female colleagues, while raising awareness 
of gender balance through workshops and 
webinars. RHI Magnesita further reinforces 
these efforts through initiatives such as 
EmpowerHER, an internal development 
academy for female talents, and maintaining 
a gender balance ratio in our Global Trainee 
Programme for 2024. Our collaboration  
with “SHEgoesDIGITAL” aligns with our 
commitment to promoting the role of women  
in the digital sector, helping young talents of  
all backgrounds to develop an interest in  
careers in information technology.
The Group also launched a Global Internal 
Mentoring Programme, an initiative designed to 
empower and elevate careers at RHI Magnesita, 
with a special focus in 2023 on encouraging 
female leadership within our organisation.
As of the end of 2023, board female 
representation stood at 29%, while 28% of all 
senior leadership positions, including the EMT 
and direct reports, are held by females. Our goal 
is to increase the share of female leaders at EMT 
-1 level to 33% by 2025. Board diversity will be 
restored to 33% if shareholders approve the 
nomination of Katarina Lindström to the Board  
at the 2024 AGM.

Our communities Related SDGs
As our Group continues to expand, maintaining 
robust and positive relationships with our local 
communities is integral to our ongoing success. 
Our sites are located in diverse and sometimes 
remote regions and it is essential for us to 
understand local context. We regularly  
engage and consult with our stakeholders, 
seeking to understand and respect their 
interests and priorities.
In 2023, ‘Health and medical care’ was approved 
by the Corporate Sustainability Committee as 
a new community investment pillar to align the 
Group’s community strategy with the practical 
reality of local spending priorities. 
The Group funded more than 220 community 
initiatives globally during the year, focused 
on the three main pillars of (i) education and 
youth development; (ii) health and medical 
care, and (iii) environment. Depending on local 
needs, we may also support projects in other 
areas including wellbeing, arts and culture, 
and emergency relief. The Group encourages 
employees to participate in and support 
volunteering activities.
The community investment programme is 
often carried out in partnership with local 
non-governmental organisations and reputable 
entities who implement projects aimed at 
fostering enduring social and environmental 
improvements in communities close to  
our operations.
Our pillars
Our approach to community investment has 
been developed based on the UN Global 
Compact, focusing on three main pillars: 
Education and youth development
RHI Magnesita recognises the importance  
of empowering individuals through education 
and skill development initiatives. Our focus  
is on supporting programmes that promote 
access to high quality education, vocational 
training, and lifelong learning opportunities. 
By investing in education, the Group aims 
to support community members with the 
necessary tools to succeed and contribute  
to the growth of their communities.
Community spend 2023 by focus area
We aim to create and support programmes that 
engage young people in intentional, dynamic 
and valuable ways while recognising and 
enhancing their strengths.
Health and medical care
The Group is committed to improving the 
health and medical care of communities where 
it operates. Investments are directed towards 
initiatives that address healthcare accessibility, 
disease prevention, mental health support, 
and promoting healthy lifestyles. By prioritising 
health and medical care, the Group aims to 
create healthier and more resilient communities 
and improve community relations.
Environment
RHI Magnesita is committed to addressing 
climate change and the protection of the 
environment. The Group’s investments focus  
on supporting projects that promote 
environmental protection, waste reduction, 
conservation of natural resources, and other 
sustainable practices.

Brazil social  
empowerment projects
A social empowerment project engaged over 180 women 
from vulnerable economic situations in a unique Christmas 
decoration course, resulting in the manual creation of more 
than 5,000 decorations using recyclable materials. Women 
from various communities in Contagem and Brumado were 
empowered through training in upcycling techniques, 
encouraging creativity and providing a potential source  
of income.
“Magic Christmas” extended its impact, reaching over 700 
children from social projects in Contagem, Ponte Alta, and 
Brumado. In this initiative, children express wishes for gifts 
which are matched through an internal campaign within the 
company. Employees enthusiastically embrace the initiative 
which has a clear positive impact for local children. 
The campaign was orchestrated by the Volunteer Programme 
of the Company, with the support of 80 volunteers and over 
200 “godparents”. RHI Magnesita’s “Magic Christmas” project 
combines sustainability, community support, and festive spirit, 
creating lasting memories and fostering goodwill.
On behalf of the communities, I would like to 
thank you for everything you have done for our us. 
What a beautiful moment, what enchantment, 
what fun, what love, what smiles, our children 
were overflowing with joy. Thank you to all the 
volunteers, for their commitment, for the beauty  
of the event, thank you all.”

 CASE STUDY – EMPOWERMENT & VOLUNTEERING
Our initiatives 
Youth development, Casa de Apoio, 
Contagem, Brazil
RHI Magnesita’s partnership with Casa de  
Apoio has been in place since 2019 and  
yielded tangible results for local young  
people, with numerous initiatives contributing  
to the education and empowerment of 
vulnerable communities. 
In 2023, RHI Magnesita supported 64 talented 
students from the Casa de Apoio social project 
with sewing classes and fully equipped facilities, 
in a fashion design project called “Ponto da 
Moda”. The project celebrated local culture,  
art and cuisine. 
RHI Magnesita’s partnership with Casa de Apoio 
goes beyond education, encompassing sport, 
music and artistic workshops, digital inclusion, 
and holistic support for children, teenagers, 
and families in need. Since 2019, more than 
2,160 children and teenagers have been served 
directly. 60 elderly people and more than 
10,000 adults benefited indirectly.
Education, Jinan, China
RHI Magnesita sponsored a primary school 
located in Laiwu District, Jinan City, including 
the donation of 400 school bags to students 
Supporting primary education contributes to 
academic development as well as improving 
community relations.
Volunteering
RHI Magnesita encourages staff volunteering to 
increase community engagement and to make 
a positive impact on the communities in which 
we operate.
A volunteering programme in the Vienna 
Headquarters was fully implemented in 2023, 
serving as a pilot scheme for other regions 
and paving the way for the establishment of 
a permanent volunteering programme. Each 
employee in Vienna is granted one day of paid 
volunteering leave per year.
“When the Others Plant Trees”, 
Pfaffstätten, Austria 
Volunteers engaged in a conservation initiative 
within the Glaslauterriegel-Heferlberg-
Fluxberg nature reserve in Austria. 
Partnering with the Landschaftspflegeverein 
Thermenlinie-Wienerwald-Wiener Becken 
(LPV), RHI Magnesita volunteers removed

dry grasslands. These grasslands are renowned 
as one of Austria’s most species-rich habitats, 
playing a pivotal role in supporting various 
insects and rare species of butterflies. 
Engaging in this initiative heightened awareness 
of biodiversity and climate protection, as the 
preservation of grasslands is positive for CO2 
sequestration.
RHI Magnesita and environment 
protection, Dalian, China
Over 200 employees in China participated 
in a project themed “Reduce the use of 
plastic bottles. Protect our Environment.” This 
collective commitment involves saying “No” to 
plastic water bottles and other plastic products, 
advocating the use of reusable containers  
made from glass or ceramics. 
Internal records indicate that prior to the project, 
the Dalian plant generated over 60,000 waste 
plastic water bottles, highlighting the pressing 
issue of plastic pollution. To address this, the 
initiative provides practical tips for reducing 
plastic waste in daily life, such as rejecting 
plastic straws, opting for eco-friendly bags, 
choosing cartons or glass containers over 
plastic, and buying food in bulk to minimise 
packaging waste.
Indigenous people
RHI Magnesita recognises and respects 
Indigenous peoples, their rights and heritage, 
knowledge, and practices. None of the 
Group’s operational sites are located close to 
any Indigenous communities. RHI Magnesita 
supports the strengthening of legal recognition 
for Indigenous territories including protection 
against illegal mining and guaranteeing 
Indigenous people a strong voice in local  
and global dialogues that affect their future. 
 CASE STUDY – YOUTH DEVELOPMENT 
India youth 
development projects
The Group funded an initiative in India with 
Don Bosco Tech focusing on short-term skill 
training spanning two months followed by 
job placements for underprivileged youth. 
Participants included 380 girls and 340 boys, 
with training programmes encompassing 
customer care, sewing machine operation, 
data quality analysis, desktop publishing, food 
& beverage service, domestic electrician, and 
general duty assistant roles. These vocational 
skills align with market demands, offering 
direct pathways to gainful employment. 
Trained individuals will be contributing to the 
local economy by meeting skill gaps in various 
industries. This helps businesses thrive and 
stimulates economic growth in these regions. 
The initiative is supported by a strategic MoU 
signed in 2023. RHI-Magnesita’s committed 
contribution is approximately €200,000. 
Objectives are scheduled for accomplishment 
by March 2024, aligning with the end of the 
India financial year.

EU TAXONOMY
Sustainability
EU Taxonomy
EU Taxonomy
The EU Taxonomy Regulation (“EU Taxonomy”) 
applies in respect of the financial year to 
31 December 2023 and requires the Group to 
report annually on the proportion of its turnover, 
operating expenditure and capital expenditure 
attaching to economic activities that are 
considered to be environmentally sustainable. 
The EU Taxonomy identifies the six 
environmental objectives: climate change 
mitigation; climate change adaptation; the 
sustainable use and protection of water and 
marine resources; the transition to a circular 
economy; pollution prevention and control; and 
the protection and restoration of biodiversity 
and ecosystems. In respect of the 2023 financial 
year, the Group, RHI Magnesita has reviewed 
its activities that qualify as eligible and aligned 
according to the published technical screening 
criteria for climate change mitigation and 
adaptation, including amendments to Article 8. 
Additionally, the Group is reporting eligibility 
on the other four EU environmental objectives 
according to the technical screening criteria 
specified in the Taxonomy Environmental 
Delegated Act. As no sector-specific guidance 
for the refractory industry has been published 
yet and therefore the Group is required to use its 
own judgement against the eligibility criteria. 
The NACE (the statistical classification 
of economic activities in the European 
Community) codes most closely describing 
the activities of the Company are “23.20 
Manufacture of refractory products” and “08.99 
Other mining and quarrying”. These NACE 
codes are not listed in Annex I or Annex II of 
the Taxonomy Regulation, but certain activities 
carried out by the Group do meet the definitions 
of economic activities listed in Annex I of 
the Regulation. As elaborated further by the 
Commission on Taxonomy, if the NACE code 
of an economic activity is not mentioned in 
the Climate Delegated Act, but the economic 
activity corresponds to the description of the 
activity, it can qualify as Taxonomy eligible. 
The EU Taxonomy distinguishes between 
taxonomy eligibility and taxonomy alignment. 
An economic activity can be considered 
eligible if it is listed in the annexes of Taxonomy 
regulation. However, in order to be considered 
“aligned”, further Technical Screening Criteria 
(TSC) must be met. This requires a further 
assessment of the eligible activities identified. 
The TSC comprise of Substantial Contribution 
plus the Do-No-Significant-Harm criteria 
(DNSH) for each of the environmental objectives 
associated with the relevant business activities. 
Additionally, the Minimum Social Safeguards 
(MSS) at the corporate level have to be met.  
The overall aim of this process is to establish  
the taxonomy-eligibility and alignment. 
The EU Taxonomy Alignment refers to the 
process of aligning the EU’s Taxonomy 
Regulation with existing and proposed national 
and international sustainable finance initiatives. 
Accounting policy
RHI Magnesita N.V. prepares consolidated 
financial information in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles under 
IFRS, as adopted by the EU and the financial 
information for turnover, operating expenditure 
and capital expenditure presented under the EU 
Taxonomy has been prepared under the same 
accounting principles.
Taxonomy eligible activities  
of RHI Magnesita 
The following RHI Magnesita’s economic 
activities are outlined in the annexes of EU 
Taxonomy Delegated Acts and therefore, are 
deemed eligible:
• CCM 3.6 Manufacture of other low  
carbon technologies.
• CCM 5.9 Material recovery from non-
hazardous waste.
• CE 2.7 Sorting and material recovery of  
non-hazardous waste. 
•  BIO 1.1 Conservation and restoration of 
habitats, ecosystems, and species.
R&D supports eligible economic activities, 
allocated accordingly. GHG emission avoidance 
related to R&D is not material, and therefore,  
not reported separately.
Manufacture of other low carbon 
technologies
The economic activity CCM 3.6 “Manufacture 
of other low carbon technologies” covers 
the “Manufacture of technologies aimed at 
substantial GHG emission reductions in other 
sectors of the economy”.1
EAF refractories
RHI Magnesita provides refractory products 
specifically designed for EAFs. Additionally,  
RHI Magnesita provides solutions and services 
to its customers to reduce their GHG emissions, 
including digital solutions as well as advanced 
refractory products. 
EAFs are a vital enabling technology for the 
reduction of CO2 emissions in the steel industry. 
EAFs can be powered using electricity sourced 
partially or wholly from renewable electricity 
and replace the BOF phase of the traditional 
integrated steel manufacturing process, 
which pairs a blast furnace with a BOF and is 
highly CO2 intensive. To replace a BOF, EAF 
steelmaking requires scrap steel, and a source 
of virgin iron like DRI or pig iron produced from 
the reduction of iron ore. EAF steelmaking 
requires a source of scrap steel or sponge iron 
produced from the reduction of iron ore.
DRI using elevated levels of or exclusively 
hydrogen and is a new technology under 
development that seeks to eliminate CO2 
emissions from the reduction of iron ore in  
blast furnaces using coke. If sufficient quantities 
of hydrogen manufactured from renewable 
sources can be accessed and if a DRI furnace 
can be paired with an EAF for the second stage 
of the steelmaking process that is also powered 
by renewable energy, CO2 emissions from steel 
production can be largely eliminated. A key 
limiting factor for increased DRI production is 
currently the availability of suitable iron ore, as 
DRI production requires highest quality iron 
ore pellets while blast furnaces can consume 
almost any kind of iron ore facing no restrictions. 
RHI Magnesita has a leading market position 
in EAF-specific refractories, services and 
solutions, in part due to the unique chemical 
composition of the Group’s vertically integrated 
raw material supply. EAF refractories produced 
by RHI Magnesita directly enable substantial 
reductions in CO2 emissions at steel plants, as 
the EAF output is displacing steel that would 
otherwise have been produced using a blast 
furnace and BOF.
In its EU taxonomy disclosure for the year to 
31 December 2022, RHI Magnesita used its 
own judgement to categorise the sale of EAF 
refractories as both an eligible and aligned 
activity according to CCM 3.6 “Manufacture of 
other low carbon technologies”. This assessment 
was based on widely available public information 
from multiple sources which substantiated that 
the production of steel through scrap or DRI fed 
Electric Arc Furnaces could result in significantly 
lower CO2 emissions than the traditional 
integrated steelmaking process, using blast 
furnaces and basic oxygen furnaces. 
On 20 October 2023, the EU Commission 
published guidance on the implementation 
and interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Climate 
Delegated Act which specified verification 
requirements for certain activities. The 
verification requirements in the guidance 
stipulate that an external verifier must provide 
an independent report to support compliance 
with alignment criteria. The Group is unable to 
fulfil this verification requirement in respect of 
the 2023 financial year but intends to obtain 
suitable independent verification in the future. 
For the financial year to 31 December 2023, 
sales of Electric Arc Furnaces have been 
excluded from its Taxonomy aligned activities 
and have also been removed from the 2022 
comparative year disclosure. Sales of Electric 
Arc Furnaces remain Taxonomy eligible and 
continue to be disclosed as eligible activities in 
both 2023 and 2022.

Digital solutions and other products that 
increase energy efficiency 
RHI Magnesita offers digital solutions and 
associated physical equipment which achieve 
CO2 emissions reductions through process 
efficiencies, such as wear monitoring and 
gunning repairs to extend the safe working  
life of refractory linings. Safely extending the 
working life of refractory linings can achieve 
significant energy savings for steel producers 
by reducing the number of heating and cooling 
cycles required per unit of steel output. 
The Group also offers advanced refractory 
products which enable its customers to 
substantially reduce GHG emissions by 
reducing electricity consumption, improving 
yield and reducing oxygen consumption, saving 
up to 13kg CO2 per tonne of steel produced. 
Other solutions and products which directly 
contribute to CO2 emissions reductions at 
customers’ sites include cold setting mixes,  
EAF direct purging plugs and converter inert 
gas purging. 
Material recovery from  
non-hazardous waste 
The activity CCM 5.9 Material recovery from 
non-hazardous waste covers the “construction 
and operation of facilities for the sorting and 
processing of separately collected non-
hazardous waste streams into circular raw 
materials involving mechanical reprocessing, 
except for backfilling purposes.” 
RHI Magnesita increased its SRM input to 
12,6% of raw material used in production of 
refractories. As part of this effort, RHI Magnesita 
operates facilities for the sorting and processing 
of spent refractories from customers’ industries. 
Circular raw materials which are mechanically 
processed by RHI Magnesita and transformed 
from waste to raw material are eligible for 
consideration under the EU Taxonomy, whilst 
circular raw material processed by a third  
party and purchased externally by the Group 
are non-eligible. 
Sorting and material recovery of non-
hazardous waste
The activity CE 2.7 “Sorting and material 
recovery of non-hazardous waste” covers 
“Construction, upgrade, and operation of 
facilities for the sorting or recovery of non-
hazardous waste streams into high quality 
secondary raw materials using a mechanical 
transformation process”.
RHI Magnesita actively collaborates in the 
transition to a circular economy through the 
sorting and material recovery of non-hazardous 
waste. This encompasses the construction, 
upgrade, and operation of facilities for sorting  
or recovering non-hazardous waste streams  
into high-quality secondary raw materials  
using mechanical transformation processes. 
1. RHI Magnesita offers products and services which help to make CO2-intensive processes in the steel industry more efficient and therefore achieve emissions reductions in the global steel industry.
Across various sites, RHI Magnesita engages 
in sorting non-hazardous waste, recovering 
materials for use as secondary raw materials in 
its refractory production, aligning with the EU 
taxonomy criteria.
Conservation and restoration of 
habitats, ecosystems and species
The activity BIO 1.1 “Conservation and restoration 
of habitats, ecosystems and species” covers 
in-situ conservation and restoration activities 
aligned with Convention on Biological Diversity”.
RHI Magnesita is committed to the protection 
and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems, 
specifically through the conservation and 
restoration of habitats, ecosystems, and 
species. RHI Magnesita’s engagement in-situ 
conservation and restoration activities aligns 
with the Convention on Biological Diversity’s 
definition and applies to its open-pit mining 
operations, where recovery of ecosystems  
and habitats is planned and executed.
The Group operates multiple mines, where 
a crucial aspect of open-pit mining involves 
restoring ecosystems and habitats. In 2023, 
recultivation activities occurred at seven sites.
KPIs
Share of Taxonomy-eligible revenue, operating 
expenditure and capital expenditure – climate 
change mitigation, transition to circular 
economy, and protection and restoration  
of biodiversity and ecosystems.
Turnover
The turnover KPI is calculated as the ratio of 
turnover associated with taxonomy-eligible 
and/or aligned economic activities in the 
reporting period to total turnover in that period. 
The total turnover of the financial year 2023 
of €3.6 billion forms the denominator of the 
turnover key figure and can be taken from the 
Key performance indicator “Revenue” on page 
29 of the Annual Report.
The following eligible and/or aligned activities 
have been identified as relevant in view of 
turnover: 
• CCM 3.6 Manufacture of other low carbon 
technologies.
• CCM 5.9 Material recovery from non-
hazardous waste.
•  CE 2.7 Sorting and material recovery of non-
hazardous waste.
Most of our Taxonomy-eligible turnover 
(numerator) are reported under Activity 
CCM 3.6. “Manufacture of other low carbon 
technologies”. The only portion of our turnover 
Taxonomy-aligned is reported under Activity 
CCM 5.9 “Material recovery from non-
hazardous waste”. 
A thorough analysis of turnover KPI drivers 
during the reporting period considered diverse 
revenue sources, including customer contracts 
and lease income. About 90% of materials 
recovered by the Group from non-hazardous 
waste are consumed internally. Therefore, the 
2023 financials now include external Turnover 
from material recovery in non-hazardous waste.
Capital expenditure
The capex KPI is defined as Taxonomy-eligible 
capex (numerator) divided by total capex 
(denominator), for the financial year, ended 
December 31, 2023.
The following eligible activities have been 
identified as relevant regarding the capital 
expenditure KPI:
• CCM 3.6 Manufacture of other low  
carbon technologies.
• CCM 5.9 Material recovery from non-
hazardous waste.
• CE 2.7 Sorting and material recovery of  
non-hazardous waste. 
The project descriptions of the additions of 
assets in the reporting year served as a basis  
for the necessary identification.
Taxonomy-eligible capex (numerator) is an 
aggregation of addition to property, plant 
and equipment reported under Activity CCM 
5.9 “Material recovery from non-hazardous 
waste” and Activity CE 2.7 “Sorting and 
material recovery of non-hazardous waste”; 
and to internally generated intangible assets 
reported under Activity CCM 3.6 “Manufacture 
of other low carbon technologies”. No eligible 
capex related to acquisitions through business 
combinations is reported. There is neither 
a capex plan to expand RHI Magnesita’s 
Taxonomy-aligned economic activities nor to 
upgrade Taxonomy eligible economic activities 
to render them Taxonomy-aligned. The total 
capital expenditures in line with point 1.1.2.1. 
Annex 1 of the Disclosure Delegated Act equal 
the denominator.
Total capex consists of additions to tangible 
and intangible fixed assets during the financial 
year, before depreciation, amortisation and any 
re-measurements, including those resulting 
from revaluations and impairments, as well 
as excluding changes in fair value. It includes 
acquisitions of tangible fixed assets (IAS 16), 
intangible fixed assets (IAS 38), right-of-use 
assets (IFRS 16) and investment properties  
(IAS 40). 
Operating expenditure
The denominator of the operating expenditure 
KPI shall cover direct non-capitalised costs that 
relate to R&D, building renovation measures, 
short-term lease, maintenance and repair, and 
any other direct expenditures relating to the 
day-to-day servicing of assets of property, plant 
and equipment by the undertaking or third

party to whom activities are outsourced that are 
necessary to ensure the continued and effective 
functioning of such assets. 
The following eligible activities have been 
identified as relevant regarding the operating 
expenditure KPI:
• CCM 3.6 Manufacture of other low carbon 
technologies.
• CCM 5.9 Material recovery from  
non-hazardous waste.
• CE 2.7 Sorting and material recovery of  
non-hazardous waste. 
•  BIO 1.1 Conservation and restoration of 
habitats, ecosystems, and species. 
Most of our Taxonomy-eligible opex (numerator) 
is related to assets or processes associated with 
taxonomy-eligible activities reported under 
Activity CCM 3.6. “Manufacture of other low 
carbon technologies”. We have also reported 
a portion of our turnover under Activity 5.9 
“Material recovery from non-hazardous 
waste”. There is neither a capex plan to expand 
taxonomy-aligned activities nor related to 
the purchase of output of taxonomy-aligned 
activities. An analysis of key elements of change 
in opex KPI during the reporting period has 
been conducted and as a result, recultivation 
opex has been reported under the activity 
BIO 1.1 “Conservation, including restoration, 
of habitats, ecosystems and species”. Opex 
related to activity CE 2.7 “Sorting and material 
recovery of non-hazardous waste is overlapping 
with opex reported under activity CCM 5.9 “ 
Material recovery from non-hazardous waste” 
therefore, not reported. Total applicable opex is 
in line with the Taxonomy legislation consisting 
of maintenance opex and R&D opex. Other 
Opex categories such as short-term lease are 
excluded as they are immaterial.
Avoidance of double counting 
To avoid double counting, data sources for 
the various reported items are individually 
crosschecked to identify overlapping 
classifications. Where double counting is 
identified, overlapping data is removed from  
the eligible amount. 
Taxonomy aligned activities of  
RHI Magnesita 
For the eligible economic activities of 
RHI Magnesita previously described, the 
following activity are considered aligned:
• Material recovery from non-hazardous waste.
In respect to alignment criteria, RHI Magnesita 
considered its activities under “Material recovery 
from non-hazardous waste” aligned because for 
each raw material recovery site, monthly yield 
reports demonstrate a constant yield above 
50% which fulfil the alignment criteria.
Do No Significant Harm (DNSH)
To fulfil the DNSH criteria for the identified 
taxonomy-eligible economic activities, 
corresponding analyses and surveys were 
carried out in accordance with (EU) 2021/2139 
to establish taxonomy alignment. 
For the economic activity Material recovery from 
non-hazardous waste (5.9), the DNSH criteria 
to climate change adaptation and to protection 
and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems 
need to be met.
DNSH to climate change adaptation
Activity 5.9
For the climate risk and vulnerability analysis 
for objective 2 “climate change adaptation”, 
potential climate hazards were analysed and 
assessed for their risk potential in accordance 
with the requirements of Appendix A (EU) 
2021/2139. RHI Magnesita conducted 
climate risk assessment considering both 
physical and transitional climate risks 
aligned with TCFD. Four climate scenarios 
(representative concentration pathways 2.6, 
4.5, 6.0 and 8.5) were considered based on 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change Fifth Assessment Report and the 
International Energy Agency (“IEA”) Sustainable 
Development Scenario. The results of the 
assessment indicated that the impact for 
physical risks is limited, since measures are  
in place to assess on a regular basis the risk  
of physical damage of assets. Insurance  
policies are covering physical damaged by 
natural catastrophes. 
DNSH to protection and restoration  
of biodiversity and ecosystems
Activity 5.9
The requirements for objective 6 “Biodiversity” 
according to Appendix D of Regulation (EU) 
2021/2139 are ensured due to the legal 
framework within the EU. For sites outside the 
EU, the national legal framework was analysed.
RHI Magnesita considers its mining sites as the 
part of the production process with the highest 
potential for adverse effects on biodiversity. 
Therefore, the assessment focuses on mining 
sites. For all RHI Magnesita’s mining sites an 
environmental impact screening has been 
conducted. Out of the six mining sites. The 
mining sites operate within or near IUCN 
category Ia, II, IV, VI and unclassified (Natura 
2000) protected areas. All mining sites fulfil 
general environmental protection requirements 
in line with legal requirements. “Material 
recovery from non-hazardous waste” replaces 
virgin materials with secondary raw materials; 
thus, contributes in an effective way to reduce 
the environmental impact associated with raw 
material extraction.
Minimum Social Safeguards 
To ensure compliance with minimum social 
safeguards RHI Magnesita established a due 
diligence process. According to Article 8 
(EU) 2020/852, the OECD Guidelines for 
Multinational Enterprises, the UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights, 
including the principles and rights set out in 
the eight fundamental conventions identified 
in the Declaration of the International Labour 
Organisation on Fundamental Principles and 
Rights at Work and the International Bill of 
Human Right were considered by RHI Magnesita. 
In 2023, a Human Rights Officer was appointed. 
Policies on global gender equality, and 
anti-discrimination/harassment are available 
online. The Code of Conduct is available in 
11 languages and available on the Company 
website, intranet, and Compliance Portal. 
The Anti-Slavery Statement is updated and 
published annually on the Company’s website.
Our suppliers shall adhere to the same 
principles as outlined in our Supplier Code 
of Conduct, which includes laws related to 
the protection of human rights. Furthermore, 
RHI Magnesita has implemented processes to 
continuously screen business partners in high-
risk countries for compliance with fundamental 
human and labour rights. RHI Magnesita has 
established an independent whistleblowing 
hotline and web-based system, which allows 
both employees and third parties to make 
reports anonymously. Additionally, other 
reporting channels are available. All cases 
reported are investigated by the Internal 
Audit, Risk and Compliance department in 
conjunction with other relevant departments. 
Moreover, business partners (e.g. customers, 
sales intermediaries and suppliers) and 
transactions such as mergers or acquisitions 
are subject to a due diligence process. All sales 
agents are certified by Ethixbase360 (formerly 
TRACE International), a leading international 
organisation specialised in third-party due 
diligence solutions, which is updated annually 
and includes a reputational screening that can 
detect any human rights violations that may 
have occurred.
With all these measures, RHI Magnesita ensures 
compliance with the minimum safeguards 
for itself and its suppliers, and processes are 
implemented to become aware of suspicious 
cases of human rights violations, corruption,  
and bribery and to be able to react accordingly.

Task Force on Climate-Related  
Financial Disclosures (TCFD)
Introduction
RHI Magnesita is committed to transparency 
about its climate-related risks and opportunities. 
In line with this commitment, we support 
the Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD) and the EU Taxonomy. We 
have made it a priority to identify, evaluate, and 
manage climate-related risks and opportunities, 
and we are always striving to improve our 
process while providing essential information to 
our stakeholders to make informed decisions.
RHI Magnesita has reported according to the 
TCFD recommendations since 2019 and has 
updated its climate-related risk assessment, 
including the newly acquired sites in China, 
India, Europe and the USA, and enlarged its 
disclosure in 2023. 
The TCFD recommendations are the 
world’s most commonly accepted standard 
for disclosing climate-related risks and 
opportunities. They focus on four key pillars  
of Governance, Strategy, Risk Management  
and Metrics and Targets.
Board oversight
The Board of RHI Magnesita guides the 
development of our strategy and appetite 
towards risk. It also has oversight of other 
material matters such as regulatory 
developments or reputational and financial 
topics. Responsibility for and oversight of 
climate-related risks and opportunities has 
been assigned to the Corporate Sustainability 
Committee (CSC). 
The Chairman of the Committee, who is 
responsible for overseeing RHI Magnesita’s 
climate strategy, engages directly with 
RHI Magnesita managers and employees on 
climate topics as required between the regular 
Committee meetings. Certain members of 
the Executive Management Team regularly 
attend the Committee meetings. The 
Committee Chairman reports to the Board on 
climate-related matters on a regular basis. 
The CSC regularly reviews climate risks and 
opportunities, strategy and performance, while 
the Remuneration Committee reviews and 
approves bonus payment linked to climate. 
Climate-related progress is discussed at 
every CSC meeting, with the Chair engaging 
directly with those driving the CO2 strategy in 
between CSC meetings as needed. The Audit & 
Compliance Committee oversees any material 
ESG risks, including climate-related risks.
In 2023, the corporate Sustainability 
Committee (CSC) met five times and addressed 
the following issues related to climate change:

Page 43:

TCFD
• Reviewed progress against 2025 targets 
including the CO2 emissions intensity 
reduction target.
• Received reports on the methodology of 
the CO2 roadmap, which is based on three 
pillars: Carbon avoidance, Carbon Capture 
Storage & Utilisation and Scope 3 emissions 
reduction, highlighting RHI Magnesita’s 
strategies for reducing carbon emissions  
and adopting sustainable practices.
• Received reports on the Group’s 
participation in carbon capture technology 
initiatives and strategic partnerships such as 
its investment in and co-operation with MCi 
Carbon, a technology provider specialising 
in the mineralisation of CO2 emissions.
• Received reports on the Carbon Border 
Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), an 
important climate protection instrument  
of the European Union (EU), and 
its associated potential impacts on 
RHI Magnesita’s operations.
Additionally, the corporate Sustainability 
Committee (CSC) addressed the following 
issues related to climate in the supply chain:
• Received an overview of RHI Magnesita 
supply chain due diligence that includes  
the country-specific risk assessment  
tool, EcoVadis supplier assessments,  
and on-site supplier ESG audits and risk 
mitigation efforts.
• Reviewed the status quo of data gathering 
for product carbon footprint (PCF) data and 
the outlook for 2024.
Management
At management level, in the C-Suite, the 
CTO reports regularly to both the CEO and 
Board CSC on a quarterly basis and anytime 
in-between as necessary. The CTO is also on 
the Executive Management Team. He directly 
oversees the development of the Company’s 
CO2 strategy and its implementation across the 
organisation. The Global Sustainability Team 
reports to the CTO and manages and facilitates 
sustainability across RHI Magnesita.
Driven by our Board and led by our Executive 
Management Team, we engage widely with 
stakeholders, investigate risks, and identify 
opportunities aligned with our sustainability 
strategy. Our climate governance is outlined  
in Figure 1.
In 2023 we further integrated carbon 
considerations into key processes:
• 25% of the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
payout criteria is linked to the Group’s target 
to reduce CO2 emissions per tonne against  
a 2018 baseline year.
• Increase the use of secondary raw material 
accounts for 10% of the annual bonus for  
all eligible employees.
• Enhanced monthly monitoring of CO2 
emissions (Scope 1 and 2) was integrated  
into the Group’s enterprise resource 
planning tool. 
In addition to that, we are continuously  
evolving our approach to engage with  
suppliers to fully integrate sustainability 
aspects, including emission transparency,  
into our procurement process.
Our goal is that by 2025 two-thirds of 
our suppliers will be rated by EcoVadis. 
Engagement on the subject of emission 
transparency is ongoing, particularly with our 
raw material suppliers, which accounts for 
approximately. 70% of our Scope 3 emissions. 
Through meetings, follow up calls, the Group 
highlights to potential suppliers that reducing 
CO2 emissions is a key priority for the Group, 
which is expected to drive changes in supplier 
behaviour and energy use in the long term.
Climate strategy
Driving down carbon emissions is a key priority 
for RHI Magnesita. Besides mapping out our own 
transition path, we would like to be a reliable ally 
to our customers as they venture into a carbon-
reduced economy.
The Group’s emission reduction plans target 
a 15% reduction in CO2 emissions intensity for 
Scope 1, 2 and 3 (raw materials) emissions by 
2025, compared to 2018. Our climate strategy 
is based on:
1) reducing the carbon footprint of our raw 
materials, including through the increased 
use of circular raw materials;
2) increasing energy efficiency in our 
operations;
3 reducing the carbon intensity of our energy 
sources; and
4) providing innovative solutions to reduce 
customer emissions.
In 2023, the Group has updated the modelling 
and analysis of climate-related transitional risks 
and opportunities that are foreseen to impact 
the Group over the short-, medium-, and long-
term horizons.
Short term (2025)
For short-term risks (between 0-2 years, 2025), 
Group’s first set of sustainability targets are 
planned within this timeframe. In addition, 
we are actively monitoring emerging trends 
and opportunities that may require us to 
adjust our strategic plans. We are committed 
to staying agile and adapting our plans as 
needed to ensure that we remain competitive 
in the marketplace and continue to meet 
our sustainability targets, specially our 2025 
climate-related ones.
In 2023, total CO2 emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 
3 – raw materials) were 4.6 million tonnes and 
our emissions intensity has reduced by 12% 
compared to 2018 base year. This progress is 
a result of recycling overperformance, but this 
has been offset by slower progress on switching 
to alternative fuels which is now uncertain due 
to capex constraints. Achieving our target is 
intricately tied to the effectiveness and success 
of our recycling initiatives, a key lever of our 
strategic approach.
While mergers and acquisitions (M&A) 
can bring strategic advantages, the Group 
anticipates a potential downside in terms of 
carbon footprint and target achievement. The 
integration of new entities may disrupt existing 
sustainability initiatives, causing a temporary 
setback. Harmonising diverse standards, supply 
chains, and operational processes poses 
challenges, affecting the overall environmental 
performance. To mitigate this impact, the Group 
is seeking to align sustainability practices and 
implementing efficient transition strategies to 
incorporate newly acquired sites while keeping 
carbon intensity goal.
Medium term (2030)
For Medium term risks (between 2-5 years, 
2030), it is the most likely horizon for the 
regulatory frameworks (such as the EU 
Emissions Trading System and Carbon Border 
Adjustment Mechanism) currently over a three-
years transition period, and to be expanded 
to all sectors within EU ETS in the future thus 
having partial effect on to RHI Magnesita’s 
operations due to the gradual phase out of free 
allocations. We are anticipating and considering 
major adjustments to our industrial footprint.
Long term (2050)
For the long-term risks, the Group considered 
the deadline that has been set by the UN 
and many policy-making bodies to meet 
decarbonisation goals, being the year 2050. 
During 2021 and 2022, we completed a 
detailed assessment of all possible measures to 
reduce CO2 emissions in our operations based 
on proven technology and available financial 
resources. Whilst it may be possible to reduce 
emissions in line with a “well below 2 degrees” 
scenario, it is our current assessment that it is 
not possible to set a target that is aligned with 
a 1.5-degree scenario which is not dependent 
on the development of as-yet-unknown 
technologies or significant external financial 
and infrastructure support. 
We are committed to reduce our carbon 
footprint and we will continue to monitor 
the variables which support this conclusion 
and update our transition plan accordingly if 
the Group’s own R&D activities result in the 
development of new technologies that could 
deliver a faster reduction in CO2 emissions that 
is financially achievable. 
Impact of climate-related risks on the 
Group’s strategy
RHI Magnesita defines “substantive financial or 
strategic impact” as impact which is classified as 
“high” (score 4) or “critical” (score 5) impact.

• The Group integrates carbon permit price 
projections into its financial planning and 
has a hedging programme in place to fix 
future exposures
• RHI Magnesita supports industry 
partnerships for the development of 
carbon capture and usage technologies 
These include the K1-MET consortium in 
the Austrian steel industry and the 
Industrial Advisory Board of the EU-funded 
MOF4AIR project, a development of the 
new Metal Organic Framework for 
capturing CO2. The Group also progressed 
a joint programme with the University of 
Leoben to research the possibility of 
re-mineralisation of captured CO2
• The Group aims to increase the use of 
secondary raw materials which will reduce 
CO2 emissions compared to the mining or 
purchase of fresh raw material
• We will continue to invest in fuel switching, 
renewable energy and energy efficiency as 
additional methods to reduce our carbon

low (e.g. EAF) 
    
• We are already providing our customers 
with refractory products that support 
low carbon production processes. This 
includes our steel and cement customers 
who account for 70% of our business.  
For example, we provide products 
supporting EAFs for the steel industry, 
which is an enabling technology for CO2 
emissions reduction
• RHI Magnesita has a higher market share in 
lower CO2 emitting applications (such as 
EAF) and a lower relative market share  
in high emitting applications (e.g. BOF, 
Blast Furnace)
• We will continue to offer our low energy 
and carbon services and product offering 
including process optimisation, recycling 
services, coating technologies and 
digital solutions

refractory products 
    
• In the short term, increasing the share of 
SRM in our products will help us to reduce 
our geogenic emissions from raw materials 
and create attractive low-carbon products
• In the longer term, if the Group is 
successful at developing and operating 
carbon capture and sequestration or 
utilisation technologies and switching  
to renewable energy sources, refractory 
products could be manufactured with low  
or potentially zero CO2 emissions
• This is expected to translate into a pricing 
and/or market share advantage compared 
to competitor products with high 
emissions, particularly as customers focus 
more on their Scope 3 emissions
Short-

RHI Magnesita defines the impact of a risk, 
including those related to climate change,  
on a scale of 1 (minor) to 5 (critical). Each of 
these five ratings has specific definition and 
quantifiable indicators based on the potential 
to compromise the ability of RHI Magnesita in 
achieving its strategic, operational, financial  
and compliance goals. 
• A score of 1 represents minor impact on  
our ability to achieve these goals. 
• A score of 2 represents low impact in 
achieving such goals.
• A score of 3 represents moderate impact 
(for example the potential for one strategic 
deliverable to be slightly delayed). 
• A score of 4 represents high impact on the 
achievement of our goals, which might result 
in one objective not being achieved or being 
significantly delayed. 
• Finally, a score of 5 represents a critical 
impact on RHI Magnesita’s ability to deliver 
more than one goal.
With specific reference to climate-related risks, 
the following four quantifiable indicators are 
used by RHI Magnesita to define a substantive 
strategic or financial impact: 
• An impact that would compromise the  
ability of RHI Magnesita to achieve (or 
achieve in a timely fashion) one or more 
objectives defined in the Group’s 2025 
company strategy, which includes climate-
related targets. 
• An impact that would compromise our  
ability to achieve our financial objectives by 
more than 15% group budgeted EBITA.
• An impact that would compromise our ability 
to meet climate regulatory requirements 
applicable to our company resulting in 
negative international media attention and/
or reputational damage to RHI Magnesita.
• An impact that would create a substantial 
disruption to a) our plants (i.e., the inability 
to continue operations in more than one 
of RHI Magnesita key locations across four 
global regional areas) and b) our ability to 
fulfil contracts with customers comprising 
a negative impact of more than 15% group 
budgeted EBITA for the year and/or c) 
compromise the safety of our employees.
We have conducted our analyses across three 
different time horizons. The short-term (2025) 
sits within our short-term business plan, while 
the medium (2030) and long-term (2050) 
time horizons are oriented towards the broader 
international policy developments, including 
the Paris Agreement and the EU Green Deal.
Having reviewed the analysis, the Group 
believes and endorsed by CSC that it is well 
positioned to mitigate the risks and embrace 
the opportunities associated with the climate-
change related developments across the 
different scenarios. These could range from 
disruptive regulatory developments, physical 
hazards for our operations or new business 
opportunities, for example, to earn a Green 
Premium for low/no-CO2 refractories. The 
Group believes that through monitoring 
market developments and enhancing its 
business adaptability, innovation and planning, 
RHI Magnesita can maintain a strong level 
of climate resilience over the short, medium 
and long- term across different scenarios. 
We remain committed to supporting our 
customers’ decarbonisation efforts as well as 
actively managing our own climate-related 
risks and opportunities.
Climate risks management
The Group has an established risk management 
approach with the objective of identifying, 
assessing, mitigating, monitoring and reporting 
uncertainties and risks that could impact 
the delivery of RHI Magnesita’s strategy. 
Since the environment and climate change 
represents both strategic and operational 
risk to our business, they are considered as 
RHI Magnesita’s principal risks (see our risk 
management approach on our Annual Report 
2023, on pages 45-57). Several mitigation 
measures are in place to ensure that the  
risk is appropriately managed and within  
the Group’s risk appetite. 
The risk management process at RHI Magnesita 
combines top-down, bottom-up and subject-
specific risk assessments. The top-down risk 
assessment is performed by the Executive 
Management Team and reviewed by the 
Audit Committee, and reporting against these 
risks is included in Board meetings, Executive 
Management Team meetings and strategic 
reviews. The bottom-up risk assessment is based 
on operational sites that maintain ongoing risk 
management activity and is linked to the quality 
management-based governance practices. 
Subject-specific risk assessments are performed 
for areas of emerging or important risks such 
as climate change. These risk assessments 
are reviewed by the CEO, the Executive 
Management Team and the Audit Committee.
Climate-related risks are grouped as physical 
risks and transitional risks and are fully 
integrated within the RHI Magnesita risk 
management system.
Physical risks include greater severity of 
flooding, droughts or other extreme weather 
events which could disrupt our operations or 
supply chain. 
Transitional risks arise from the uncertainty in 
the global move towards a more sustainable, 
low-carbon economy. These risks involve  
shifts in the regulations, market dynamics, 
technology and investor expectations related  
to climate change.
The process of identifying and assessing all 
Groups risks, including climate-related risks,  
is as follows.
Starting from the risk universe (comprising all 
risk categories that could impact businesses 
in the next ten years), categories which are not 
applicable to our business are excluded from 
the risk analysis. Categories of risks identified as 
applicable to our Group are analysed to identify 
specific risks that impact (or potentially impact) 
our business. These are linked to potential 
root-causes and assessed for their inherent 
likelihood, impact, and velocity.
For climate-change risks, the following 
categories are considered: acute and chronic 
physical risk, legal, current and emerging 
regulations, technology, market, and 
reputational risks. Within each category, 
specific risks impacting direct operations, 
downstream and upstream, are identified 
and assessed based on the Company’s risk 
management processes.
Risk impact is evaluated based on a scale of 
1 (minor) to 5 (critical). Each rating has a specific 
definition based on the impact of the risk on 
RHI Magnesita’s strategic, operational, financial 
and compliance goals.
Risks are also rated according to their inherent 
likelihood on a scale of 1 (rare) to 5 (very likely) 
based on their probability or expected frequency.
Once likelihood, impact and velocity of a risk 
has been assessed, an appropriate response is 
determined. This ranges from mitigating the risk 
to transferring or avoiding the risk based on the 
level of “risk appetite” defined by the Board.
Appropriate initiatives to reduce the level 
of inherent risk are then identified and 
implemented. The level of residual likelihood 
and impact after mitigation is assessed for 
each risk using the scoring system above (i.e. 
impact on a scale of 1 “minor” to 5 “critical” and 
likelihood on a scale of 1 “rare” to 5 “very likely”).
The overall level of residual risk is evaluated 
to ensure that it is aligned with the Company’s 
risk appetite and risk tolerance. Effectiveness 
of mitigating measures is monitored over time 
and risks are re-assessed at least on an annual 
basis and as needed in the case of significant 
changes in the risk landscape.
Risks 
The Group has updated the modelling and 
analysis of climate related transitional risks  
and opportunities that are foreseen to impact 
the Group over the short, medium, and long-
term horizons. 
RHI Magnesita’s main risk is the additional 
operating expense resulting from carbon pricing 
developments. The financial impact of this risk 
has increased due to implementation of CBAM 
in Europe, which is an EU policy instrument 
designed to level the playing field for domestic 
producers subject to carbon pricing by 
implementing a carbon-based import tariff  
on goods from countries without equivalent 
carbon pricing.

CBAM is designed to protect domestic 
producers from competitive disadvantages 
resulting from carbon pricing by making imports 
from countries without equivalent carbon 
pricing more expensive. This mechanism 
would help to ensure that domestic producers 
and consumers are not put at an economic 
disadvantage by having to bear the cost 
of carbon pricing, while their international 
competitors do not. The CBAM is intended to 
incentivise countries to adopt similar carbon 
pricing policies, thereby reducing the global 
emissions of greenhouse gases.
The implementation of the Carbon Border 
Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is expected 
to have a financial impact on the Group from 
2030 onwards as free carbon allowances under 
EU-ETS are phased-out. This is due to levies 
on imported materials, which are designed 
to protect the EU domestic business. This is 
expected to increase refractory pricing for 
all suppliers selling into the EU. Additionally, 
products manufactured in the EU and then 
exported will incur higher costs, as there are 
currently no compensation mechanisms for 
exporters. The financial impacts of the CBAM 
have been included in the Group’s updated 
TCFD modelling, resulting in impact on  
equity value ranging from €180 million 
to €350 million.
Opportunities
Three opportunities were identified: (i) 
increased demand for products that customers 
will require for technology transition, e.g. EAF 
refractories; and (ii) increased demand for low-
carbon refractory products containing recycled 
raw materials; and (iii) increased recycling rate 
and absorption of carbon expenses via recycling 
for EU operations. 
The steel industry is undergoing a 
decarbonisation process which is predicted 
to continue into 2050 and beyond. This 
megatrend has led to an increased demand 
for electric arc furnaces (EAF) and electric 
smelter furnaces. As the pressure to reduce 
carbon emissions intensifies, RHI Magnesita is 
well-positioned to benefit from this growing 
trend. With its vertically integrated model, 
RHI Magnesita has access to the raw material 
required for an electric arc furnace from 
its European mines in Austria, Hochfilzen 
and Breitenau. This gives RHI Magnesita a 
competitive edge and makes it the leading 
refractory partner of choice in the green 
transition of the steel industry.
Additionally, RHI Magnesita’s joint venture 
with Horn & Co., MIRECO, combines recycling 
activities in Europe and increases the 
production, use and offering of secondary raw 
materials. This results in a significant decrease 
in CO2 emissions. MIRECO is well positioned at 
the forefront of the circular economy, providing 
services to customers in steel, cement, glass 
and other process industries (read more on 
recycling and circular economy on page 72).
The net impact on equity value of these 
opportunities combined is +€388 million 
(2022:+123 million; 2021:+€352 million).
Physical-related risks and opportunities
The Group has undertaken a comprehensive 
update of risk assessments at its production 
sites across a broad range of physical climate 
hazards, to cover newly acquired sites. The 
analysis considered 70 sites, including all 
production sites, recycling facilities and  
mining locations.
The assessment considered four distinct climate 
scenarios—RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and 
RCP8.5—taken from the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment 
Report. These scenarios project varying 
greenhouse gas concentration trajectories, 
indicating potential outcomes such as staying 
below a 2°C temperature increase, reaching 
approximately 2°C above the modern climate 
baseline, a global temperature rise of about 3–4 
°C by 2100, and an exceeding 4°C increase in 
the global average surface temperature by 2100.
The assessment focused on evaluating future 
exposure of RHI Magnesita sites to climate-
related hazards across temperature, wind, water, 
and solid matter, encompassing a total of 29 
categories. Due to data availability, some climate 
dimensions had risks calculated over different 
time periods. The estimation of future climate-
related risks was rooted in probability, gauging 
the likelihood, expressed as the relative number 
of years in the data ensemble, that future climate 
values would surpass the mean values of the 
current climate at specified locations.
Results revealed some sites are susceptible 
to physical climate hazards. The Group will 
perform a further detailed risk assessment 
for 32 flagged sites in 2024. This approach 
ensures that the Group is addressing climate-
related risks and improving the resilience of its 
operations. Separately, a three-year programme 
dedicated to assessing physical damage 
risks of any origin is being implemented. 
This assessment involves site visits by 
experts to evaluate preparedness for various 
risks, encompassing structural conditions 
and geographical exposure to extreme 
weather events such as storms, hurricanes, 
and earthquakes. Newly acquired sites are 
integrated into the three-year programme. 
Insurance policies provide coverage, 
encompassing protection for our assets against 
physical damage and losses, including damage 
arising from natural catastrophes.

Metrics and targets
The Group’s emission reduction plans target 
a 15% reduction in CO2 emissions intensity for 
Scope 1, 2 and 3 (raw materials) emissions by 
2025, compared to 2018. 
In 2023, total CO2 emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 
3 - raw materials) were 4.6 million tonnes 
and our emissions intensity has reduced by 
12% compared to the baseline year of 2018. 
This progress is largely a result of recycling 
performance. There has been slower progress 
on switching to alternative fuels due to capex 
constraints, public infrastructure delays and 
uncertainty in energy markets. The Group is on 
track to achieve its 2025 CO2 intensity reduction 
target, mainly through its successful efforts to 
increase the use of recycled raw materials.
The Group has increased transparency for its 
customers by disclosing the carbon footprint 
of its c.200,000 refractory products in the 
Customer Portal. 
CO2 emissions calculations follow the principles 
of ISO 14067 standard and include all Scope 
1 and 2 emissions, as well as relevant Scope 3 
emissions related to the manufacturing process 
(known as “cradle-to-gate” greenhouse gases 
from raw material extraction to production  
and packaging).
The Group is undertaking a substantial M&A 
programme which may affect the achievement 
of its environmental targets. The integration of 
new entities may disrupt existing sustainability 
initiatives. Harmonising diverse standards, 
supply chains, and operational processes 
poses challenges which may affect overall 
environmental performance. To mitigate 
this impact, the Group is seeking to align 
sustainability practices and implementing 
efficient transition strategies to incorporate  
new acquired sites.
Tracking our progress
We use metrics and targets to track our progress 
in relation to our material climate-related risks 
and opportunities.
Outlook
We recognise the importance of understanding 
our risk and opportunity landscape in guiding our 
climate strategy. In addition to charting our own 
transition, we want to be a trusted partner to our 
customers on their journey to net zero. We will 
further deepen our climate-related initiatives in 
the coming years to help us to continue to be a 
sustainability leader within the sector.
