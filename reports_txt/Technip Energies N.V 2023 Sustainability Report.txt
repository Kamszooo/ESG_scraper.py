MESSAGE FROM THE
Chair of the 
Sustainability 
Committee
Colette Cohen
Dear stakeholders,
As Chair of the Sustainability Committee, I am proud to introduce the Technip Energies 
Sustainability Report for 2023. 
The Sustainability Committee,  created by the Board in 2023, is tasked with providing 
stronger oversight of sustainability matters and ensuring clarity of focus on key issues 
with the appropriate supporting Board expertise.
The Sustainability Committee plays a pivotal role in assisting the Board to shape the 
sustainability strategy and objectives of the Company. It is instrumental in defining the 
Company’s ESG Roadmap and Scorecard and overseeing its execution. Sustainability 
leadership starts with our Board of Directors and extends throughout the Company.
MAKING AN IMPACT 
Sustainability is embedded in the purpose and core values of Technip Energies, driving 
value creation through all activities of the organization. In 2023, I am pleased to report 
that substantial progress has been made across all three pillars of the roadmap thanks 
to the dedication and motivation of more than 15,000 talented professionals that make 
up Technip Energies. 
The Company’s own scope 1 & 2 emissions decreased by 28% compared to 2021. 
Research and development (R&D) efforts of the Technology & Innovation organization 
have been intensified and are now 100% directed towards creating technologies that 
support the journey to net zero, completing this target two years ahead of plan.
Yet, emissions are only one aspect of the Company’s impact on the environment. To 
preserve our planet, we must also address biodiversity loss. In this respect, we have 
made a new commitment which has been added to our 2024 ESG Scorecard.

“The Sustainability Committee 
plays a pivotal role in assisting 
the Board to shape 
the sustainability strategy 
and objectives of the Company.”
We continue to make substantial progress by setting impactful targets and being 
intentional in our decisions. This is clearly evidenced by the increasing number of 
women in the workforce and in leadership positions. In 2023 with the appointment of 
Stephanie Cox, I am delighted to report that the milestone of 40% female 
representation on the Board of Directors has now been reached. In my experience, 
improving diversity by giving women bigger roles and the opportunity to succeed leads 
to a more successful and sustainable company. As we undergo the transformation to a 
net zero future, attracting, engaging, and retaining the best talents, while developing 
people’s skills and competencies, is a top priority for the Company. 
We do all of this with a strong commitment to integrity. In 2023, we introduced and 
rolled out across the organization “Integrity @ the core”, a campaign to promote the 
importance of compliance at Technip Energies. As we work across the globe building a 
net zero future with our customers, it is essential that we also do it with the highest 
standards of compliance and business ethics. 
LOOKING AHEAD TO 2024 
In 2024, we will strive to make even greater progress on our sustainability journey, 
embracing innovation, collaborating to develop new and sustainable business models, 
and taking a coordinated and structured approach to ensure integrity and compliance 
throughout the value chain. 
As the world embarks on the transition from one energy mix to another, Technip 
Energies is uniquely positioned with the skills and technologies required to bridge the 
traditional energy industry with low-carbon opportunities. From strategy to tendering 
decisions, engineering design to full project delivery, we believe it is possible to deliver 
more energy, with less carbon, while ensuring that sustainability is at the heart of how 
we do business.

MEASURING SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE 
AND RECOGNIZING SUCCESS 
We are proud of our great sustainability achievements of 2023. 
As part of our commitments, we worked towards accelerating 
the low-carbon transition. Through innovative solutions, impactful 
partnerships, and a steadfast commitment to environmental 
responsibility, Technip Energies achieved remarkable milestones. 
These achievements not only reflect the Company’s dedication 
but also contribute to a more sustainable and resilient future for 
all. Moreover, Technip Energies actively fostered a culture of 
inclusion and responsibility by collaborating with stakeholders 
across industries.
Our ambition to be leader of our sector is being confirmed 
by  ESG rating agencies. Thanks to the progress we have 
made on our sustainability journey, we are now rated above 
industry average by the main ESG rating agencies; MSCI has 
confirmed our AAA industry leader rating for the second year 
in a row, Sustainalytics now ranks us within the top 10%, our 
S&P Global rating improved to top 7% , our ISS ESG rating 
improved to top 30% , and our CDP rating improved to B , 
above the industry average. 
In recognition of its success, ‘Seed of Hope’, the flagship CSR 
program of our India Operating Center, was awarded the 
‘Best CSR Project of the Year ’ by the Indo-French Chamber 
of Commerce & Industry. Since its launch in 2015, the 
program, which promotes inclusive growth and environmental 
sustainability in the communities where the Group operates, 
has impacted over 90,000 lives. 
COLLECTIVE COMMITMENTS
We support the United Nations (“UN”) Global Compact

In 2023, we have made significant progress towards achieving our targets. 
On Climate & Environment , we reduced our scope 1 & 2 emissions by 28% compared to 
2021 thanks to our 5-point action plan to reduce the carbon footprint of our offices and 
industrial sites. We have implemented actions to protect the environment. In 2023, 91% of 
the waste generated in our operations was recycled and 12.6% of water was reused. We 
have also introduced a new commitment to protect biodiversity by committing to zero 
projects in IUCN management categories I and II. 
On People, we are pleased to report that our safety results continue to improve, our TRIR 
is among the lowest in the industry, reflecting the importance of our Pulse HSE safety 
program, which saw over 9,000 participants in 2023. 
We consider Diversity and Inclusion as business priorities. We continue to improve the 
diversity of our workforce and are cultivating behavioral change to boost innovation and 
collaboration and to deliver tangible results of gender representation at all levels. We now 
have 30.5% of women employees and 22% of women in leadership positions, in line with 
our ambitious targets. 
Through our employee value proposition, we invest in the development of our people’s 
skills and competencies to attract, engage and retain the best talents. With the launch of 
T.EN University, we are enhancing the learning mindset and preparing the organization to
be future ready. “Be part of the solution” is our call to action. Indeed, the second edition
of “My Voice”, our global employee engagement survey, recorded an increased
participation rate of 82%.
On Trust , 2023 has seen the formalization and implementation of many important 
processes. In conversation with stakeholders and the Building Responsibly association, we 
have developed a series of worker welfare guidance notes, which form the basis of our 
Human Rights policy. In November, we held our inaugural ESG supplier council during 
which we set out our QHSE supplier and subcontractor sustainability assessment program 
and discussed the importance of collaboration and engagement through human rights due 
diligence to deliver a just transition.
All these achievements are thanks to the drive and commitment 
of all our employees, and they reflect the progress that can be 
made when we all work together towards shared goals. This 
encourages us once again to refine our ESG approach to further 
our ambitions and accelerate results. 
Throughout this report, we provide the progress status at the 
end of 2023 for each target defined in the ESG Scorecard 1. 
In section 3. Sustainability performance, we present concrete 
examples of the progress being made.

(1) The definition of each ambition of the ESG Scorecard is detailed in the section 4.2. Definitions and methodologies of the 2023 Annual report.
OUR ESG ROADMAP AND SCORECARD
The route to sustainability is a journey, one that is 
continuously assessed, improved, and driven forward. We are 
not alone in this journey, all stakeholders share an interest, 
which is why it is at the heart of our Purpose and aligned 
with our Values. “Together by T.EN” encapsulates our shared 
sense of responsibility.
The role of our ESG Scorecard is to translate the priorities of 
today into tangible actions for a better tomorrow which 
aligns the interests of our clients, people, communities, and 
planet. It has been developed to measure performance and 
track progress; it is designed to evolve. Each impact-driven 
target contributes to the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals (UN SDGs), and in this report we explain 
the progress we have made towards each ambition and set 
out the next steps of our journey.
For Technip Energies, sustainability 
is about boosting innovation, creating 
new opportunities, and developing new 
businesses. As a leading engineering and 
technology company, we are transformation 
enablers. Because there is an urgent 
need to align with the net zero trajectory, 
to limit global warning, and contribute 
to a regenerative future. This is a critical 
decade. The projects, technologies, 
products, and services of Technip Energies 
have never been more relevant.”

In 2023, we have made significant progress towards achieving our targets. 
On Climate & Environment , we reduced our scope 1 & 2 emissions by 28% compared to 
2021 thanks to our 5-point action plan to reduce the carbon footprint of our offices and 
industrial sites. We have implemented actions to protect the environment. In 2023, 91% of 
the waste generated in our operations was recycled and 12.6% of water was reused. We 
have also introduced a new commitment to protect biodiversity by committing to zero 
projects in IUCN management categories I and II. 
On People, we are pleased to report that our safety results continue to improve, our TRIR 
is among the lowest in the industry, reflecting the importance of our Pulse HSE safety 
program, which saw over 9,000 participants in 2023. 
We consider Diversity and Inclusion as business priorities. We continue to improve the 
diversity of our workforce and are cultivating behavioral change to boost innovation and 
collaboration and to deliver tangible results of gender representation at all levels. We now 
have 30.5% of women employees and 22% of women in leadership positions, in line with 
our ambitious targets. 
Through our employee value proposition, we invest in the development of our people’s 
skills and competencies to attract, engage and retain the best talents. With the launch of 
T.EN University, we are enhancing the learning mindset and preparing the organization to
be future ready. “Be part of the solution” is our call to action. Indeed, the second edition
of “My Voice”, our global employee engagement survey, recorded an increased
participation rate of 82%.
On Trust , 2023 has seen the formalization and implementation of many important 
processes. In conversation with stakeholders and the Building Responsibly association, we 
have developed a series of worker welfare guidance notes, which form the basis of our 
Human Rights policy. In November, we held our inaugural ESG supplier council during 
which we set out our QHSE supplier and subcontractor sustainability assessment program 
and discussed the importance of collaboration and engagement through human rights due 
diligence to deliver a just transition.
All these achievements are thanks to the drive and commitment 
of all our employees, and they reflect the progress that can be 
made when we all work together towards shared goals. This 
encourages us once again to refine our ESG approach to further 
our ambitions and accelerate results. 
Throughout this report, we provide the progress status at the 
end of 2023 for each target defined in the ESG Scorecard 1. 
In section 3. Sustainability performance, we present concrete 
examples of the progress being made.

1. OUR VISION TOWARDS A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE
1.1. INTEGRATING SUSTAINABILITY INTO OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY
From value preservation to value acceleration 
At Technip Energies, we believe we have a critical role to play 
to accelerate the energy market transformation in a 
sustainable way and make a positive impact by providing 
solutions to help our clients achieve their decarbonization 
goals.
To make this impact, our strategy is articulated around the 
value we bring to our stakeholders; in the way we preserve 
value by acting with integrity to reduce risk, we create value 
by boosting innovation and making our Company attractive to 
stakeholders, and we accelerate value by launching new 
businesses and scaling up solutions as the leading, profitable 
and sustainable business for the energy transition.
Our strategy is to grow sustainable 
stakeholder value 
Value preservation forms the foundations of any strategy, 
future proofing the Company for the evolving energy 
landscape. By adopting a risk-based approach, the three 
pillars of our ESG Scorecard; Climate & Environment, People, 
and Trust, set out the Company priorities and engagements 
around impact-driven targets. Strong governance ensures 
that we have the policies, processes, and code of conduct in 
place to align our strategy with stakeholder expectations and 
challenges us to surpass our targets. Integrity frames the 
way we act every day, and we are committed to regular and 
transparent reporting on our sustainability performance. 
Technip Energies’ differentiated hybrid model, which marries 
long-cycle project delivery with short-cycle technology, 
products, and services (“ TPS”), provides an ideal blend to 
drive profitable growth across energy cycles and create 
tangible added value. Technology-driven, with excellent 
execution capabilities, we have a strong track record in 
delivering sustainable products and solutions across all our 
business lines. With outstanding energy molecule 
transformation capabilities, we have the strategic flexibility 
to meet customer needs from energy source to end-use. 
Creating value for stakeholders starts by engaging and 
collaborating with our employees, clients, suppliers, partners, 
investors, and communities to foster a culture of 
sustainability, inclusion, and responsibility. Technip Energies 
is, above all, human energies. By leveraging our collective 
expertise, we provide integrated and customized solutions 
that minimize the environmental and social impacts of our 
projects, while ensuring operational excellence, quality, and 
safety. Digitalization and innovation are the boosters that 
power value creation. Leveraging data through powerful AI 
tools gives us more predictive insight to optimize processes, 
improves efficiency, and reduces time to market. Innovation 
and diversification of our portfolio bring new solutions to 
meet the changing needs and expectations of our clients and 
stakeholders. In conjunction, all three levers drive value 
acceleration. 
Solutions to decarbonize at scale
Accelerating action in this critical decade is the key message 
from the COP28 agreement to limit global warming to 1.5°C. 
At Technip Energies we have the technologies and solutions 
available now, especially in the areas of low-carbon and 
renewable energy, circular economy, and digital transformation, 
which positions us for rapid growth. Already, our portfolio of 
studies through to EPC and projects include around 30 Mtpa

clean H2/power-to-X, along with 4  MW of Floating Offshore 
Wind. In 2023, we launched Capture.Now™, a full range of 
CCUS solutions across the value chain, which includes 
Canopy by T.EN™, our modular post-combustion solution for 
industrial applications, as well as BlueH 2 by T.EN™ to 
produce low-carbon hydrogen. All these flagship offers are 
totally aligned with our net zero ambition and highlight our 
market positioning in the decarbonization era.
In 2023, we also launched two new companies: Rely to 
accelerate industrialization of green H 2 and power-to-X, and 
Reju, which is focused on textile PET recycling. The recent 
acquisitions of Processium, an R&D company specialized in 
process technology, and Seed Energy, a digital services 
startup, as well as investments in pioneering cleantech 
funds, all serve to boost innovation and accelerate value.
As the energy industry undergoes major transformation, we 
are investing in the development of our people’s skills and 
competencies and enhancing the learning mindset across the 
organization to be part of the solution. This is our call to 
action to accelerate the net zero trajectory, leveraging our 
employee experience with an inspiring learning and 
development journey for all. Through our commitment to 
foster a diverse and inclusive workplace that acts to protect 
human rights and contributes to the development of local 
communities, we are “breaking boundaries together to 
engineer a sustainable future”.

GLOBAL TRENDS
ENERGY DEMAND
While global energy 
demand continued to 
shift towards renewable 
sources, non-renewable 
energy sources are still 
prevalent to satisfy the 
rising energy demand. 
This dynamic has 
highlighted the critical 
importance of innovative 
solutions to achieve 
energy efficiency, energy 
security and carbon 
emissions reduction 
without compromising 
on economic growth and 
accessibility.
ECONOMY
The global economy 
showed resilience  
with a gradual recovery 
from pandemic-era 
disruptions. However, 
the economic landscape 
was marked by 
inflationary pressures 
and supply chain 
challenges. Geopolitical 
uncertainties (the war 
context in Ukraine 
and the Hamas-
Israel conflict) have 
further contributed 
to the aforementioned 
challenges. 
RACE FOR  
TALENT
Companies seeking 
skilled professionals 
in green and low-
carbon technologies 
and digital 
transformation are 
facing an intensified 
race for talent. This 
had led to a more 
competitive job market 
and an increased focus 
on talent attraction, 
employee upskilling, 
reskilling, and retention 
programs.
DIGITAL AND 
TECHNOLOGY 
Significant advancements 
in digital technologies, 
especially the integration 
of Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
into businesses, Internet 
of Things (IoT), and 5G 
enhanced efficiency 
and connectivity within 
and across sectors. 
This technological 
shift was pivotal in 
driving innovation 
and digitalization of 
traditional industries. 
Energy transition has also 
benefited from the use 
of enhanced technology 
to leverage data and 
to increase connectivity 
and accessibility.
SUSTAINABLE 
DEVELOPMENT 
Corporate strategies 
increasingly integrated 
sustainable development 
prospects, focusing on 
reducing carbon footprints, 
enhancing energy 
efficiency, embracing 
ESG roadmap and 
promoting environmental 
stewardship. COP28 
signalled the “beginning 
of the end” of the fossil 
fuel era through the first 
international agreement 
reached on tackling fossil 
fuels and once again 
highlighted the need 
for a just and equitable 
transition towards net 
zero emissions.

BlueH2 by T.EN™: Low-carbon hydrogen solutions 
with up to 99% emissions capture
Clean hydrogen is crucial to decarbonizing the most energy-
intensive sectors including industry (steel, cement and 
refining), transportation (marine and heavy vehicles), power 
generation and heating for large commercial and residential 
buildings. Hydrogen is key for an affordable, secure, and 
clean energy future.
Technip Energies is a world leader in hydrogen. Our proprietary 
steam reforming technology represents an estimated 30% of 
the globally installed base for on-purpose hydrogen. Of these 
facilities, close to 20% could feature carbon capture 
solutions. 
Within the Capture.Now™ platform of CCUS solutions, BlueH 2 
by T.EN™ is a unique suite of fully integrated, low-carbon 
hydrogen technology and EPC solutions to deliver the best 
possible levelized cost of production with the lowest carbon 
footprint across any type or scale of plant.
Proprietary ATR technology for large-capacity, 
ultra-blue hydrogen 
As a global leader in hydrogen, we have added Oxidative Auto 
Thermal Reforming (ATR) technology in partnership with 
Casale to our extensive range of proprietary Steam Methane 
Reforming (SMR) technology solutions to deliver large-
capacity, ultra-blue solutions with up to 99% carbon capture 
rates. 
The oxidative reforming process - Auto Thermal Reforming 
(ATR) and Partial Oxidative (POx) - produces syngas that 
contains hydrogen, CO, and CO 2. ATR combined with Technip 
Parallel Reformer (TPR ®) and carbon capture is a cost-
effective way to produce low-carbon hydrogen on a large 
scale with optimized steam production. ATR is a game-
changing technology as it breaks the upper capacity limit of 
traditional hydrogen plants, which were economically 
constrained by the size of the SMR technology.

ESG Committee and to create a dedicated Sustainability 
Committee.
The Sustainability Committee  is in charge of assisting the 
Board in formulating the Company’s sustainability strategy 
and objectives. The Committee reviews and monitors the 
development and implementation of targets, standards, 
metrics, scorecards and methodologies that the Company 
establishes to assess and track the Company’s performance 
in relation to sustainability topics. The Committee also 
monitors the development and implementation of the 
Company’s compliance program to ensure that the Company 
complies with the principles of ethical conduct and good 
governance. The Committee advises the Board on the 
Company’s solutions and services to accelerate the path 
towards net zero, and the impact of sustainability topics on 
the Company’s culture and business model. See also the

Executive Committee
Our Executive Committee members are tasked with the 
implementation of our ESG strategy across our businesses.
Arnaud Pieton, our Chief Executive Officer, sets the direction 
for the Company’s sustainability strategy in line with our 
Purpose and Values. He is accountable for our sustainability 
performance and for creating value for our stakeholders. 
The Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer oversees strategy 
and sustainability, as well as investments, partnerships, 
strategic marketing and digital. Under his organization, the 
Vice-President Marketing & Sustainability is responsible for 
delivering on our ESG commitments, increasing our ambition 
on sustainability and positioning it at the core of our actions 
and performance. 
The Chief Financial Officer also oversees the sustainability 
agenda and ensures its alignment with the financial 
performance of the Company. He works closely with the 
Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer to ensure our 
Sustainability Reporting fully aligns with the evolving 
European regulation and provides transparent and reliable 
information to our stakeholders within a robust internal 
control framework. Together, they oversee the processes to 
identify and assess material sustainability-related impacts, 
risks and opportunities and their interactions with the 
Company strategy.
To accelerate the integration of sustainability into our 
actions, in 2023, we continue to reinforce our governance 
model structured in two bodies, the ESG Council and the 
ESG Operational Committee.
■ The ESG Council  validates the ESG roadmap and
scorecard, and communication strategy including the
ambitions on climate, environment, people and trust, and
regularly assesses its implementation to ensure the
proper application of processes. The ESG Council is a sub-
committee of the Executive Committee, chaired by the
CEO, and includes ten other members: the Chief Strategy
& Sustainability Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the
Chief Legal Officer, the Chief Operating Officer, the Chief
Technology Officer, the Chief People Officer, the Chief
Business Officer, the Chief Digital and Information Officer,
the Chief Operating Officer Reju, and the SVP of
Communications and Public Affairs.

2.2. SUSTAINABILITY POLICIES AND CERTIFICATIONS
Technip Energies’ aim of building a better tomorrow is 
intrinsically linked to the respect of its Values. Our Code of 
Business Conduct serves as a fundamental guide to be 
followed by our Directors, officers, employees and 
stakeholders. In addition, the Company has implemented 
internal policies that complement our Code of Business 
Conduct and support our management systems.
Standards defined in these internal policies assign 
quantifiable measures and define acceptable levels of 
quality. They aim to make a policy more meaningful and 
effective. Procedures establish the proper steps to take to 
operationalize a policy and/or standard. Finally, guidelines 
provide additional recommendations to clarify expectations 
in relation to a given procedure.
We are also committed to global standards, such as the 
United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 
International Labor Organization Fundamental Conventions, 
and we implement ISO management systems in our 
operations all over the world. 
Code of Business Conduct
The Code of Business Conduct  is built on our Values and 
reflects the way we do business. It describes the decision-
making and behaviors expected from our Directors, officers, 
employees and stakeholders. It is intended to give additional 
guidance to ensure that we do business and conduct 
ourselves ethically.
In addition to our Code, we have policies and procedures 
which are published on our website at www.ten.com.
Quality, Health, Safety, 
Environment and Security
Within the challenging and highly competitive global energy 
industry, Technip Energies excels by making QHSES a top 
priority.
Our Global HSE and Security Policy  sets our commitment to 
operate in a manner that protects the environment by 
providing sustainable solutions to minimize our carbon and 
environmental footprint while improving our energy and 
resource efficiency. Our policy also ensures that health, 
safety, environment and security is managed as an integral 
part of our business and is based on a genuine care and 
concern for people and the environment. We do not 
compromise on quality, safety, health, security, or 
environmental sustainability to achieve our financial 
objectives.
We are committed to continuously improving our QHSES 
performance, supporting our clients in their own journey, and 
ensuring that we dedicate appropriate resources and 
expertise to eliminate hazards, reduce risks, and prevent 
environmental pollution related to our activities through 
design, process improvement and technologies – so that we 
improve the world for future generations.
A key element of our QHSES management system is our set 
of global QHSES management standards, which are 
applicable to all our sites and projects. 
Our ISO management systems, all certified by independent 
third parties, are covering a significant part of our operations 
worldwide:
■ ISO  9001 quality management system for 95% of our
operations;
■ ISO 14001 environmental management system for 84% of
our operations; and
■ ISO  45001 occupational health and safety management
system for 77% of our operations.
See more in sections 3.1.1. Climate & Environment 
Governance and 3.2.2. Health, Safety and Well-being.
Human Rights Policy
As a member of the Steering Committee of Building 
Responsibly, an organization of leading companies that 
promote human rights and welfare of workers in 
construction and engineering, we are closely involved in the 
definition of standards and the development of tools to 
support the industry supply chain.
In December 2023, our CEO signed the Global Human Rights 
Policy, which reflects our commitment to respect and 
protect the human rights of our employees, suppliers, 
partners, and communities in accordance with international 
standards and best practices. The policy is available at 
www.ten.com/en/about/integrity-compliance.
Diversity & Inclusion Policy
We are committed to creating a sustainable future by 
focusing on diversity and inclusion, as well as environmental 
and social responsibility. 
Technip Energies’ Diversity and Inclusion Policy  sets out the 
principles regarding diversity in the workforce composition 
and the composition of the Board of Directors. The policy 
also promotes an inclusive culture that ensures equal 
opportunities for all employees, regardless of their personal 
characteristics. 
Technip Energies has set specific diversity targets for the 
percentage of female Directors and the number of women in 
senior management positions. We have implemented internal 
governance initiatives, including Executive Committee 
sponsorship and a network of local ambassadors, to drive 
change in a sustainable manner. We have also established 
annual Diversity and Inclusion plans at both global and local 
levels, which aim to mitigate unconscious bias and 
systematically remove barriers to diversity representation in 
critical decision-making processes such as hiring, promotion, 
pay, and retention. Technip Energies does not tolerate any 
form of harassment and takes measures aimed at ensuring 
that inappropriate behaviors are identified and addressed 
appropriately. See more about diversity and inclusion in the 
section 3.2.4. Diversity & Inclusion.
“SmartWorking”
Thanks to digital technology, almost everyone can work from 
almost anywhere. But this accessibility to work creates other 
challenges. Our response is called “SmartWorking”, which 
means working differently to facilitate team collaboration, 
even when we are all in different locations. This includes a 
Group policy for working from home which offers a flexible 
approach and is designed to contribute towards creating a 
better work/life balance.
We are committed to keeping offices open and promoting 
social interaction to have a positive impact for employees’ 
well-being and enhance performance.

Stakeholder Engagement Policy
The recently adopted Technip Energies Stakeholder 
Engagement Policy aims to establish a corporate stakeholder 
engagement framework that ensures consistent application 
across the Company's activities worldwide. The policy 
recognizes the importance of stakeholder engagement in 
creating sustainable long-term value and considers the 
impact of the Company's actions on people and the 
environment. 
The purpose of stakeholder engagement is to ensure that the 
interests of the relevant stakeholders are considered when 
defining the material aspects of the Company's sustainability 
strategy. Engagement with stakeholders may also occur for 
other purposes, including to promote the overall 
performance of the Company, to increase the Company's 
awareness and knowledge of one or more stakeholders and 
to build social and relationship capital. The policy outlines 
the identification of relevant stakeholders, engagement 
methods, engagement risks, disclosure of information, 
documentation of engagement, and public reporting. 
See more about how we engage with our stakeholders in the 
section 2.3. Stakeholder engagement.
Information Security, 
Data Privacy and Protection
Technip Energies’ commitment to information security is not 
only specified in policies and standards, but also considered 
in the day-to-day activities of all Technip Energies’ 
employees and contractors. Information security is 
recognized and accepted as everyone’s responsibility.
Technip Energies is actively maintaining a global ISO 27001 
certification program that involves all applicable operating 
centers over the world. ISO 27001 focuses on a company’s 
information security management system (“ ISMS”) and 
assesses the way in which information security is integrated 
into their business processes. It helps prove to customers 
that information security is a top priority for the Company.
The ISO 27001 certification applies at corporate level and is 
managed as a global initiative. To reach this goal, we went 
through several steps:
■ implementing an ISMS;
■ establishing our ISMS governance;
■ performing an internal audit to evaluate the ISMS; and
■ involving a unique third-party auditor at global scale.
In 2023, 33 entities out of a total of 55 have been certified 
since the beginning of this certification program. 
Moreover, Technip Energies adopted the US National Institute 
of Standards and Technology (“ NIST”) Cybersecurity 
Framework as a reference for cybersecurity operations and 
for continuous improvement in performance.
Supplier & Subcontractor Integrity Expectations
We aspire to develop business relationships with like-minded 
partners who are guided by a similar set of principles of 
business conduct, based on trust and integrity. 
Our suppliers and subcontractors are required to follow the 
applicable laws of each country in which they operate and 
observe the principles of the Technip Energies Code of 
Business Conduct, as well as the Technip Energies Supplier & 
Subcontractor Integrity Expectations. 
Technip Energies Supplier & Subcontractor Integrity 
Expectations outline the expectations that Technip Energies 
has for its suppliers and subcontractors. The policy 
emphasizes the importance of ethical business conduct, 
compliance with laws and regulations, trade compliance, 
antitrust and competition compliance, conflict of interest 
avoidance, respect for the environment, security and safety, 
human rights, privacy compliance, and protecting confidential 
information. Suppliers and subcontractors are required to 
adhere to the principles outlined in this policy as a condition 
of any business relationship with Technip Energies.
See more about our initiatives with our suppliers and 
subcontractors in section 3.3.2. Sustainable supply chain.
Tax Policy
At Technip Energies, we manage tax affairs with integrity in 
compliance with the laws and regulations of all the countries 
where we operate.
Through its subsidiaries, branches and joint-ventures, 
Technip Energies runs activities in more than 34 countries. 
The Company operates in a constantly shifting environment 
and is subject to complex sets of tax laws that may conflict 
when taken together or may be interpreted differently. This 
environment creates potential tax risks which require close 
monitoring.
We are committed to implementing sustainable tax and legal 
structures aligned with our business activities and not aimed 
at driving mainly tax benefits. We recognize that all the taxes 
we pay or collect for governments are part of our corporate 
social responsibility and foster a sustainable ecosystem for 
the industry.
In this respect, Technip Energies included in its Code of 
Business Conduct a section describing the principles guiding 
the Tax Policy, which have been approved by a committee of 
the Board and must be respected by all stakeholders.
To support the effective implementation of the Tax Policy, 
Technip Energies also maintains stringent internal 
procedures, which ensure a good understanding of the tax 
consequences of business decisions and help to manage 
sources of tax risks more efficiently.
Finally, we are convinced that maintaining transparent and 
collaborative communication with the tax authorities in the 
countries where we operate is key to building positive long-
term relationships and securing our business.

Energies’ website, the Code of Business Conduct, and the

2.3. STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Our stakeholders’ views and expectations are very important 
and help drive Technip Energies’ strategy and success. 
In 2021, during the first sustainability materiality assessment 
conducted for Technip Energies, we actively engaged with 
our stakeholders (through surveys and interviews) to identify 
our material sustainability topics. 
We have taken into consideration stakeholder feedback to 
build our ESG Roadmap and Scorecard and we continue to 
evolve our strategy and operations according to this feedback 
and to engage with our stakeholders through active and open 
dialogue.
In 2023, we performed the double materiality assessment to 
identify the ESG topics that are material to Technip Energies. 
As part of this exercise, we have taken into consideration the 
feedbacks received from our different stakeholders including 
from our employees, trade unions, clients, suppliers, 
investors, NGOs. See more about this assessment and results 
in the section 2.4. Double materiality. 
In the meantime, we have published the Technip Energies 
Stakeholder Engagement Policy. See more about this policy in 
section 2.2. Sustainability policies and certifications.
In 2024, the stakeholder engagement operational plan will be 
detailed and fully incorporated as part of our due diligence 
process and sustainability materiality assessment.

2.4. DOUBLE MATERIALITY
The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (“ CSRD”) 
was adopted by the European Parliament on November  10, 
2022, as part of the European Green Deal. One of the main 
goals of the CSRD is to improve and standardize 
sustainability reporting by providing external stakeholders 
(which include investors, consumers and policy makers) with 
clear and comparable information about a company’s 
environmental, social and governance performance and 
impact, thereby reducing the risk of greenwashing.
In furtherance of the CSRD, the EU commission adopted 
12  European Sustainability Reporting Standards (“ ESRS”) 
which are sector-agnostic standards that address 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) topics such as 
climate change, pollution, biodiversity, human rights and 
business ethics.
All reporting companies are required to first identify their 
material ESG subjects under the ESRS in order to report 
information relating to sustainability that is relevant to it. To 
achieve this, a company must consider how it impacts the 
environment and people (impact materiality) and how it is 
financially impacted by ESG subjects (financial materiality). 
This exercise is known as the double materiality assessment.
Sustainability statements reported according to CSRD 
standards will be included in a dedicated section of the 
Company’s 2024 Annual Financial Report as such reporting 
will become mandatory for Technip Energies for the 2024 
financial year. 
In anticipation of such requirement and in line with the GRI 
standards guidance, and in particular the GRI 3 Material 
Topics 2021, we have conducted the double materiality 
assessment to identify the ESG topics that are material to 
Technip Energies.
Impact materiality
An ESG matter is material from an impact perspective if it 
has a significant impact on people or the environment, 
whether such impact is positive or negative, and whether it is 
felt over the short, medium or long-term. To make this 
assessment we have considered our own operations as well 
as our entire value chain, which includes our suppliers, our 
clients and our other business partners. We assess an impact 
by considering its severity and the likelihood of its 
occurrence. To evaluate severity, we have taken into account 
the scale, scope, and the irremediable character of the 
relevant impact.
This exercise also allows us to identify our most significant 
impacts with a methodology in accordance with the GRI 
standards guidance, and in particular the GRI 3 Material 
Topics 2021. The correspondence between our list of ESG 
material topics and the GRI standards is available in 
section 4.4. GRI Content Index.
Financial materiality
An ESG matter is material from a financial perspective when 
Technip Energies’ financial position can be affected by risks 
and opportunities triggered by the environment, societies and 
business dynamics relevant to our operations. The materiality 
of these risks and opportunities are assessed taking into 
account the magnitude and the likelihood of the financial 
effect these risks and opportunities could entail over the 
short, medium or long-term.
2.4.1. Materiality assessment process
The Company’s double materiality assessment exercise has 
been conducted under the sponsorship of both the Chief 
Strategy & Sustainability Officer and the Chief Financial 
Officer. It has been led by a core team of five employees 
from the following functions: Sustainability, Risk 
Management, Stakeholder Engagement, Finance and Legal. 
Throughout the process, we have incorporated the views of 
our internal experts and our external stakeholders. Nature at 
large is deemed to be a stakeholder for purposes of this 
exercise. 
We have embedded our Enterprise Risk Management (“ ERM”) 
methodologies and evaluation grids into the double 
materiality assessment process, in order to ensure a 
coherence between this exercise and our Enterprise Risk 
Management processes. For more information on our ERM 
process, see section  4.2. Enterprise Risk Management 
framework of the 2023 Annual Report.
Identifying our relevant sustainability matters
We began the framing exercise by analyzing our business 
models, end-to-end value chains, and stakeholders’ feedback 
to identify the most relevant ESG matters. This process 
involved 19 Vice Presidents and members of the Executive 
Committee who covered all the businesses and support 
functions of the Group. As a result, we identified 28 matters 
that were deemed relevant to determine whether they were 
material either from an “inside out” (i.e., impact the Company 
has on the environment and people) or financial “outside in” 
point of view.
The identified topics were reviewed by the ESG Council, as 
well as shared with the internal controls team dedicated to 
sustainability reporting.
Determining Impacts, Risks and Opportunities
For each of the 28 sustainability matters, a manager having 
knowledge of the relevant matter led the exercise to gather 
appropriate internal and external contributions in order to 
identify both positive and negative impacts and associated 
risks and opportunities, taking into account the entire value 
chain and the short, medium and long-term horizons. 
The outcome of this exercise was reviewed at Vice President 
and Executive levels, as well as by the sponsors.
Assessing our relevant Sustainability Matters
We conducted assessment workshops that involved 
managers responsible for Impacts, Risks, and Opportunities 
descriptions, as well as Vice Presidents who are members of 
the ESG Operational Committee and Executive Committee 
members of the ESG Council. 
The final assessment was shared with the internal control 
team, the ESG Operational Committee and the ESG Council. 
This final assessment was approved by the Sustainability 
Committee at Board level and is included in this 2023 Annual 
Report.

2.4.2. Material Sustainability Matters
In 2023, the double materiality assessment has led to the 
identification of 20 material matters under ten ESG topics, as 
detailed further. However, as per the GRI standards, the 
assessment has identified 17 ESG material matters in terms 
of the impact materiality.
The assessment has guided the evolution of our ESG 
roadmap, as our strategy is continuously adjusting to 
prioritize issues that are highly significant to our 
stakeholders and where we can make a significant business 
impact.

Impact and Financial Materiality
2.4.3. Main impacts, risks and opportunities
Sustainability impacts are how we have an effect on our 
stakeholders, including nature, on matters relating to the 
environment, the society and business practices.
Sustainability risks and opportunities are social, 
environmental, and governance variables that could affect a 
company's financial position or operating performance. For 
Technip Energies, ESG risks include those related to climate 
change, environmental protection, working and safety 
conditions, respect for human rights, anti-bribery and 
corruption practices, and compliance with relevant laws 
and regulations.
Our process to identify, assess and manage our risks, 
threats and opportunities is described in the 2023 Annual 
Report sections  4.1. Risk Management overview and 4.2. 
Enterprise Risk Management framework where we have 
listed the main risks applicable to Technip Energies and its 
business: strategic risks, operational risks, financial risks, 
legal, regulatory and reporting risks, taxation risk, and 
ownership of Technip Energies shares. See more in the 
2023 Annual Report section  4.3. Risks to which 
we are exposed. 
The ESG-related risks are integrated in the three main risk 
categories below:
■ Strategic risks;
■ Operational risks; and
■ Legal, regulatory and reporting risks.
The tables below provide a summary of Technip Energies 
main significant impacts, risks and opportunities related to 
material sustainability matters classified per pillar: 
Environment, Social and Governance. For more details on 
the Company’s risks and how they are managed, see

Technip Energies is committed to disclosing our scope 3 GHG emissions 
and we have set a target to be net zero by 2050.
We are actively engaging with our stakeholders along our value chain to 
develop innovative solutions that reduce our scope 3 emissions and 
support our clients’ own emissions reduction goals. Notably, in 2023 we 
held our our ESG Supplier Council gathering 20 major suppliers across the 
globe to exchange best practices and identified opportunities for 
acceleration and continuous improvement of sustainability path together, 
like green manufacturing, green transport & logistics.
We also adopted a GHG Emissions Charter aiming at reducing Greenhouse 
Gas (GHG) emissions. This global initiative, spearheaded by our operating 
centers, marks a significant step in our commitment to a sustainable 
future. The charter focuses in particular on responsible design to lower 
emissions both from our supply chain and from the usage of the 
infrastructures, technologies and products that we deliver.

we operate, broaden opportunities, and support new business models by 
contributing to increasing the share of renewables in the global energy 
mix.
We are diversifying our type of offers with the growth of the Company’s 
TPS businesses to propose new solutions as well as the development of 
innovative companies (e.g., Rely and Reju) to expand Technip Energies’s 
portfolio by inclusion of a larger number of contracts and clients which 
are expected to be more diverse.
We are focusing our R&D on the low-carbon solutions and establishing 
technology pathways for our clients to achieve their net zero ambitions. In 
2023, 100% of our Technology & Innovation R&D investments were 
dedicated to sustainability, two years ahead of our 2025 target.
Technip Energies also launched an exciting external Innovation Challenge 
– the Clean Maritime Challenge – to help accelerate the decarbonization
of the marine transport industry.

Regarding physical climate risks, in 2022, Technip Energies carried out a 
study, based on the 6 th Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(“IPCC”). In 2023, we have continued the journey with a scientific insight 
by an IPCC expert, who examined our portfolio’s risk signature based on 
the newest climate models, the satellite data available, and the climate

Our Global HSE and Security Policy sets our commitment to operating in a 
manner that protects the environment by providing sustainable solutions 
to minimize our carbon and environmental footprint while improving our 
energy and resource efficiency.
In 2023, 84% of our operating centers, with more than 50 employees, were 
certified ISO 14001 ensuring a high-level environmental management 
system and impact minimization. Our objective is to reach 100% by 2025.
In addition, our teams have a long experience of Environmental Aspects 
Identification (“ENVID”) at a design stage of a project development, 
allowing to make recommendation for a safer, more environmental 
friendly design to reduce impact of the project and on its surrounding. We 
also provide our clients with Best Available Techniques (“BAT”) to prevent

The development of our employees is critical to Technip Energies’ success. We 
invest in our employees’ development, across all functions and career paths. This 
is essential for Technip Energies to continue to win and grow leading positions and 
expertise to meet the energy transition challenges. 
As part of our development strategy, we focused on attracting and developing 
talent, enhancing our employer brand, and advancing our energy transition 
solutions in 2023. Our Employee Value Proposition (“ EVP”) invites employees and 
candidates to “Become an energy game-changer and engineer a sustainable 
future.” T.EN University, a global learning center that was launched in 2023, aims 
to help employees build, learn, evolve, and grow the critical skills needed for the 
energy industry transformation. For the 2023-2025 period, the global Learning and 
Development budget will be increased and we have set in our ESG Scorecard a 
target of 40 hours of learning per year, on average, by employee by 2025. To raise 
knowledge about energy transition for young talents, we also launched an 
International Graduate Program dedicated to energy transition in 2023 and 
strengthened the Technical Expertise Program (“TEP”) with 139 new experts and 17 
promotions, especially in energy transition disciplines.

we systematically conduct Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (“ HAZID”) 
and Hazard and Operability Studies (“HAZOP”).
In 2023, we established the objective of ensuring that all of our FEED projects

3.1.1. Climate & Environment Governance
The Sustainability Committee 
Technip Energies is committed to maintaining the highest 
standards of corporate governance for climate-related issues 
and their implications on business strategy and related plans 
as well as the sustainable long-term value creation for all 
stakeholders.
The Sustainability Committee oversees the measurement and 
reporting status of Technip Energies’ carbon footprint 
scopes 1, 2 and 3, and advises the Board on the Company’s 
solutions and services to accelerate the path towards net 
zero and to highlight solutions available to our clients for 
avoiding emissions.
See more information about the Sustainability committee in 
section 5.1. The Technip Energies Board of the 2023 Annual 
Report.
Climate governance – two teams, one goal
Scopes 1 & 2
Our primary sources of greenhouse gas (“ GHG”) emissions, 
direct (scope 1) and indirect (scope 2), are from the 
operations of our offices and industrial sites (manufacturing 
sites and R&D/lab centers) and from some external data 
centers. The Vice-President of Real Estate and Facilities is 
responsible for collecting data, calculating scope 1 & 2 GHG 
emissions, monitoring and managing energy consumption to 
enhance energy efficiency, and implementing strategies to 
optimize our buildings infrastructure to reduce GHG 
emissions, and meet our scope 1 & 2 reduction targets: -30% 
by 2025 and net zero by 2030. The team is composed of 
experts in buildings management and energy efficiency. 
Scope 3
A dedicated Climate Change and Actions team was 
established in 2021 to develop quantification methodologies 
for our carbon footprint. The team's goal was to publish our 
scope 3 emissions, to support project emissions assessment 
and reduction plan. This team is now permanent and headed 
by our newly appointed Head of Climate Change and Actions, 
who directly reports to the Vice-President of Marketing & 
Sustainability.
The team works with all stakeholders across the Company, 
notably with One T.EN Delivery, Global Sourcing and 
Procurement, Global Subcontracting, the Health, Safety, 
Environment and Security department, and the Business 
Lines.
Environmental management
Our environmental management system and standards are 
the responsibility of the Chief Operating Officer (“COO”), 
supported by the Vice-President of Quality, Health, Safety, 
Environment and Security (“ QHSES”). All main entities and 
projects within the Company are managed by dedicated HSE 
managers, with a team of HSE engineers and supervisors 
responsible for the implementation of environmental 
standards in their respective scope of responsibility. All 
employees are strongly encouraged to follow the various 
environmental training courses available, in accordance with 
our Code of Business Conduct. 
The Global Environment Manager and team are tasked with 
monitoring the potential impacts, risks, and opportunities 
associated with Technip Energies’ business, to continuously 
enhance our environmental management system and our 
ambitions. This team is also responsible for consolidating and 
analyzing the environmental data reported by the operations 
and to coordinate the environmental efforts of the 
businesses and departments.
An experienced environmental team 
There are more than 130 people at Technip Energies, working 
around the world on environment-related matters. They 
assist our clients’ projects and our own operations to 
continuously improve environmental performance. 
Thanks to their vast experience, this team of managers and 
engineers recommends realistic measures to mitigate 
potential negative impacts on the environment. Our solutions 
cover the entire life cycle of a project and a wide range of 
environmental concerns such as water preservation, air 
pollution, noise disturbance control and biodiversity 
protection.
ISO 14001 Certification 
The ISO 14001 international standards, which set out the 
requirements for an environmental management system, are 
the most widely used and recognized standards to help 
organizations improve their environmental performance. 
Using a risk-based approach to respond rapidly to evolving 
environmental concerns, this environmental management 
system is integrated into the main Group’s activities: project 
management, engineering, procurement, and construction, 
testifying to Technip Energies’ responsible commitment.
In 2023, our operating cluster in Houston, covering the 
Claremont and Boston operating center and the Weymouth 
Lab was certified ISO 14001, bringing to 84% our operating 
centers with more than 50 employees now certified, and we 
are on track to achieve ISO 14001 certification of all our main 
operating centers by 2025.
ISO 14001 includes a specific environmental risk assessment 
for projects adapted to the site or local context, known as 
ENVID (Environmental Aspects and Impacts Identification). 
When a project activity falls under our HSE responsibility, our 
teams systematically carry out this assessment, which is 
regularly updated and enables us to constantly adapt our 
operational priorities and control measures.
Three pillars for action
As part of our Global HSES Policy, Technip Energies is 
committed to promoting environmental best practices in all 
our solutions, from design to project delivery; solutions that 
will respect the environment and foster a responsible 
economic model. 
Our three pillars for actions are: 
■ Climate: Mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions and adapt
our activities to the evolving climate physical risks.
■ Biodiversity: Preserve the ecosystems by implementing
the sequence ‘Avoid - Reduce - Restore’, starting at the
earliest project phases.
■ Circular economy:  Embed circularity of resources in our
solutions by promoting three of its main drivers: eco-
design, sustainable procurement, and responsible
consumption.
Sustainability reporting standards, 
an opportunity for the environment
Technip Energies uses the GRI Sustainability Reporting 
Standards as a guideline not only to improve transparency 
but also to identify and measure how the Company impacts 
the environment and people. 
The adoption of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting 
Directive (“ CSRD”) by the European Commission, marks a 
major change in environmental reporting in Europe. The

enhanced reporting requirements are part of the European 
“Green Deal” action plan and require a double materiality 
assessment. 
The double materiality assessment performed in 2023 was an 
excellent opportunity for Technip Energies’ teams to review 
and acknowledge collectively:
■ Our Company's current and potential impacts, risks and
opportunities regarding planetary limits;
■ How we could “monetize the impact of ecological
upheavals on the economic sustainability of our Company.
The result of our double materiality assessment and the 
description of our environmental impact, risk and opportunities 
are described in section 2.4. Double materiality.
In parallel, Technip Energies’ teams carried out a gap analysis 
between our current environment indicators (reported in line 
with the GRI Standards), and the mandatory data points to 
be reported according to the CSRD. As a result, we reviewed 
the definition of some of our KPIs and increased the number 
of indicators reported as presented in the section 4. Impact 
Book. 
In 2024, Technip Energies will continue to work on its action 
plans to address its material environment impacts, risks and 
opportunities.
Evaluating potential risks and opportunities 
to identify and propose optimal solutions
The risks related to climate change have a significant impact 
on Technip Energies’ activities and that of our clients 
throughout the entire value chain. 
Therefore, the identification and management of risks related 
to climate change and actions to seize opportunities are key 
for Technip Energies. Some climate-related risks are already 
captured by our company's Enterprise Risk Management 
(“ERM”), which implements risk identification and 
assessment both at global level (i.e., Group and operating 
centers) and at operational level (i.e., projects for our 
clients). Current processes enable the identification of 
climatic events that could impact the achievement of 
business objectives, strategies, and measures to address 
them.
Climate-related transition risk and opportunities
To ensure our long-term resilience in the face of climate 
change, our dedicated Climate Change and Action Team is 
conducting a rigorous quantitative climate scenario analysis. 
This analysis is aimed at devising strategies that align with a 
low-carbon economy and limit global warming to 1.5°C, in 
accordance with the Paris Agreement and the 
recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related 
Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”).
Our analysis offers valuable insights into potential climate-
related impacts on our business over various time horizons: 
mid-term (2030 and 2040), and long-term (2050). These 
insights were instrumental in our double materiality 
assessment, as detailed in section 2.4. Double materiality.
We are focusing on transition scenarios that make plausible 
assumptions about the evolution of climate policies and the 
advancement of climate-friendly technologies, with the goal 
of limiting GHG emissions. Our transition risk assessment 
estimates the potential financial impact on our business 
from modelled portfolio responses to three energy scenarios 
as proposed by the International Energy Agency (“ IEA”): the 
Announced Pledges Scenario (“ APS”), the Stated Policies 
Scenario (“STEPS”), and the Net Zero by 2050 scenario.
To manage our risks and capitalize on opportunities, we have 
initiated action plans across various departments, including 
Research and Development, Process Engineering, Purchasing, 
and Real Estate. Each department contributes within its area 
of responsibility, leveraging its unique skills and experience. 
For more details on our actions, please refer to section 3.1.2. 
Driving our decarbonization journey towards a low-carbon 
future.
Climate-related physical risk
Physical climate risks such as drought, flooding and severe 
storms already inflict material and physical damage on 
properties and people. 
Following our initial study in 2022, we pursued our research 
in 2023 with a scientific insight by an IPCC expert, who 
examined our portfolio’s risk signature based on the newest 
climate models, the satellite data available and the 3 global 
warming scenarios (1.8°C, 2.7°C and 4.7°C) as defined by the 
IPCC expert group.
The climate hazards selected in 2023 are aligned with 
emerging national climate regulatory policies. They include 
hazards with acute risks (wildfire, heat wave, cold stress, 
landslide, river flood, costal flood, extreme precipitation, 
severe storms and drought) and chronic risks (temperature 
change, precipitation change). Our major focus has been 
given to the most recent historical period 2011-2020, and the 
near future by 2030.
This figure shows the geographic locations and their overall 
hazard risk score as of today on a 1-to-5 risk scale. The 
overall multi-hazard risk score is relatively high (3 out of 5) 
for the historical period (2011-2020) and the forward-looking 
period (2021-2030) regardless of the global warming 
scenarios. For the Technip Energies portfolio, 46% has an 
overall hazard rating of moderate, 53% a rating of high and 
2% has a rating of severe.

As analyzed, the hazard-specific risk scores for the portfolio 
average are the highest for heat wave (high) and extreme 
rainfall (high) for the forward-looking period (2021-2030). And 
when considering a longer time horizon, up to 2050, the 
greatest changes are expected for heat wave and 
temperature change hazards.
This study was also considered during the double materiality 
assessment described in the section 2.4. Double materiality.
In 2024, we will have to ensure that our usual site 
management plans, including emergency plans, include 
mitigation measures for at least these two risks: heat wave 
and extreme rainfall. In parallel, we will study how this 
critical data can be used to benefit projects at the design 
phase to make the most climate-risk adapted solutions for 
our clients.
Improving data collection
Calculating our carbon footprint
Calculating the carbon footprint requires a large volume of 
data which is gathered in our databases and IT applications 
for the needs of various existing activities developed on 
projects and for support functions.
In 2023, we have developed web applications using Microsoft 
Power Apps to ensure complete traceability and transparency 
in the process of collecting and calculating GHG emissions 
data. There are two web applications: one for scopes 1 and 2, 
managed by Real Estate & Facilities, and the other for scope 
3 related to projects under execution, managed by Climate 
Change and Action. This is the first step towards 
improvement. Our next goal is to expand these web 
applications to the scope 3 out-of-projects and automate 
the consolidation dashboard. 
For projects, the Technip Energies’ Project Directors are 
responsible for the carbon footprint quantification and the 
reduction objectives of each project. Projects may involve a 
dedicated Project Carbon Manager, but the Project Director 
remains responsible for the quality and the accuracy of the 
quantification, in line with Technip Energies methodologies 
and guidelines, even if the quantification is carried out by a 
JV partner, a specialized consultant, the Client, or their own 
consultants.
Internal control processes ensure the consistency, 
completeness, accuracy, and valuation of the GHG emissions, 
as part of Technip Energies’ review process. These processes 
are intended to ensure that the inventory is compliant with 
our methodologies and accurate and to maintain continuous 
improvement and performance of any ongoing sustainability 
reporting programs, KPIs and/or targets.
Measuring environmental performance
In addition to GHG emissions, Technip Energies collects, 
monitors and reports eight types of environmental indicators 
on a monthly basis:
• energy supplied
• water supplied
• material supplied locally
• air pollutants emitted
• effluent generated
• waste generated
• biodiversity risks managed
• environmental incidents and near-misses
In 2023, around 7,000 data points have been reported by 
about 60 sites located in 23 different countries. These sites 
include EPC project sites onshore and offshore, offices and 
industrial sites. 
This data is monthly recorded in our global QHSES reporting 
tool, Intelex, with the needed qualifications:
• substance type
• source type
• management type
• working environment
This data makes it possible to provide an in-depth analysis of 
sites’ environmental performance trends, and to steer 
projects and assets in the right direction to achieve Technip 
Energies’ objectives.
Detailed indicators are given in section 4.1.1. Environmental 
indicators.

3.1.2. Driving our decarbonization journey towards a low-carbon future
In our commitment to achieving net zero emissions, we have 
established specific targets aimed at reducing our Scope 1 
and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030. As for our 
Scope 3 GHG emissions, we are in the process of defining 
mid-term targets, aligning with our pledge to reach net zero 
emissions by 2050.
Climate transition plan: scopes 1 & 2
GHG emissions and energy purchased
To reach our target to reduce scope 1 & 2 emissions by 30% 
in 2025 and achieve net zero by 2030, in 2022 we established 
a global Five-Point Action Plan to optimize building 
infrastructure (offices and industrial sites) and improve 
energy efficiency. This is now being rolled out across our 
main operating centers.
The Five-Point Action Plan includes:
2023 Achievements 
In 2023, we implemented dual reporting methods for Scope 1 
& 2 emissions: location-based (LB) and market-based (MB). 
The MB method allows us to calculate emissions using 
provider-specific factors from our electric utilities (for 
scope 2). The LB method does not factor in instruments or 
contracts and assigns the local grid average emission factor 
to all offsite usage, regardless of where it comes from. Due 
to these factors, we revised our ambition to reduce scope 1 & 
2 emissions, considering the market-based scope 2 GHG 
emissions. In addition, we changed the baseline year from 
2019 to 2021, the year when Technip Energies was officially 
formed. 
Sustainability has become a strategic driver of our building 
lease and renovation efforts. Assuming the same business 
portfolio perimeter as in 2021, we are on track to reach the 
GHG emission Scope 1 & 2 reduction target of 30% by 2025, 
and 90% by 2030. The following actions have been taken in 
2023 towards the Five-Point Action Plan established in 2022. 
■ Renewables: In 2023, we purchased 48% of our total
electricity consumption from renewable sources. Most
sites in France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, the UK,
Mumbai and Chennai in India, as well as our Claremont
offices in the USA have purchased renewable electricity.
Some sites in Paris, Rome and Kuala Lumpur are also
producing renewable electricity via photovoltaic panels.
■ Surfaces: We have achieved significant space optimization
in Technip Energies offices in 2022 and 2023, examples
include Paris, Rome, the UK, Claremont, Boston and Kuala
Lumpur. The reduction is partially offset by space
increase due to business growth in India and the Middle
East. We also increased the surface of our industrial sites
through the acquisition of Processium in Lyon. At this
stage it is premature to anticipate the impact on surface
and GHG emission from the creation of the new
companies Rely and Reju.
■ Energy consumption: The energy efficiency of certain
buildings has been recognized in 2023. Our Paris Origine
building was named as one of 100 iconic sustainable
buildings in the world during the Indian presidency of G20
in September 2023; the Paris and Lyon offices received
the CUBE Flex and the Ecowatt awards in 2023. Many
sites have implemented ambitious energy savings plans
and installed LED lighting systems for the exterior of the
building, or LED indoor lighting.
■ Partner and Train:  To increase awareness and
collaboration and improve efficiency, we have formed
Scope 1 & 2 committees in India, and Asia Pacific. The aim
of these committees are to define the actions and
intermediate targets to reach the net zero scope 1 & 2
objective. We also provided training to the real-estate
team, through our partnership with Gensler, on ESG and
Climate Change on the Houston new building project.
Following our first Climate Engaged Lease Agreement with
ICADE in Paris, we are looking to develop similar
partnerships in other countries. We continue to prepare
an offsetting program for the remaining 10% of GHG
emissions.
■ Buildings: We partnered with Schneider Electric and other
equivalent suppliers to conduct energy efficiency audits at
the UAE (Abu Dhabi offices), France (Paris Origine office
and Sens industrial site), UK (London office), India (Noida
office and Dahej industrial site), USA (Weymouth lab), and
Italy (Rome offices). We implemented new tools for energy
data collection and reporting. Our offices in India, the US,
Malaysia, and the Middle East have the highest scope 1 & 2
emissions due to the use of air conditioning in hot and
humid weather conditions and in certain cases, poor
quality of the infrastructure.
Some countries have significantly exceeded their
emissions reduction targets in offices for 2025. Italy has
achieved an impressive reduction of 80% in emissions,
followed by France with a remarkable 73% reduction, and
Malaysia with a 40% reduction.

In India, scope 1 & 2 emissions have been reduced by 30% 
in 2023 compared to 2021, with a 46% reduction of 
emissions from their offices, partially offset by higher 
emissions at the Dahej fabrication facilities where 
emissions almost doubled.
Additionally, at the Group level, there has been a 32% 
reduction in emissions since 2021 within offices. These 
achievements demonstrate our efforts in combating 
climate change and moving towards a more sustainable 
future.
In 2023, we launched the following major projects to reduce 
GHG emission and improve energy efficiency for the coming 
years:
■ In India:
• We opened new satellite offices to adapt to new
business needs in Mumbai and Gurgaon. Construction
and Design LEED Platinum buildings were selected to
minimize GHG emission in these new satellite offices.
• We audited the main sites in Noida and Dahej that we
own. The plan is to renovate these sites in the next 2-3
years and maximize the production of renewable
electricity at the site in Dahej.
■ In the US:
• In Houston, we signed a new lease in April 2023 to
move our US headquarters from the legacy office space
to a new construction LEED Platinum building in 2024.
We are reducing the surface rented and we aim to
obtain Energy Star and Operation and Maintenance
LEED Platinum certifications once we move in at the
end of year 2024. Scope 1 & 2 emissions reduction is
then expected.
• For the Houston Energy Tower 4 building, we plan to
vacate the building to reduce our space portfolio at the
end of the lease term.
• At our Weymouth industrial site, we conducted an
energy efficiency audit, and plan to renovate the lab in
the coming years to incorporate the audit
recommendations in the design and construction to
improve energy efficiency. A similar project is planned
for the Sens Manufacturing site in France, starting with
the implementation of photovoltaic panels.
■ In Europe:
• In Frankfurt, Technip Energies Zimmer will consolidate
two lab buildings and move to a renovated R&D center.
• The team in Lyon currently occupies 3 office buildings.
In 2025, they will vacate the current buildings and
move to a new LEED Gold building which is currently
under construction.
• The team of Aberdeen will be moving to a renovated
building to improve energy efficiency early 2024.
• The Barcelona office modernized their workspace to
maximize surface occupancy and improve collaboration
through the implementation of desk sharing.
In Qatar, Kuala Lumpur and Spain
• We plan to work with landlords to reduce our energy
consumption and carbon emissions by renovating the
infrastructure. In Doha and in Barcelona, the landlord is
currently installing photovoltaic panels on the roof to
produce renewable electricity for our workspace.
Data Centers
Technip Energies’ Information & Digital Services (“IDS”) are 
making significant strides in reducing their environmental 
footprint, primarily through the effective management of our 
data centers. These centers, whether owned, leased, or 
subcontracted, are transitioning towards sustainable 
practices.
Our strategy involves consolidating our data centers into 
large regional collocations and cloud services, which adhere 
to advanced energy management standards. 
We have set a target for our IDS data centers: 95% of IT 
services should be hosted in locations that meet high energy 
and environmental standards. To achieve this, we consider 
the main certification levels that are prevalent in the regions 
we operate, such as ISO 50001, and LEED Building Design & 
Construction and Operations & Maintenance rating Gold or 
Platinum.
In 2023, we intensified our efforts to select best-in-class 
partners and migrate our IT assets to certified locations. As a 
result, our global ratio reached 59%, a significant increase 
from 42% in 2022. We have initiated a major data center 
asset migration project to continue this transition and reach 
our target. 
The carbon footprint calculation methodology is detailed in 
section 4.2. Definitions and methodologies.

We are very proud of what we have already 
achieved in 2023, we have already reduced 
our scope 1 & 2 emissions by 28% in only 
2 years. The results are very encouraging. 
The teams of all main operating centers 
started to deploy an ambitious energy 
saving plan from October 2022. Since 2022, 
we have purchased renewable electricity 
in the cities and sites where sources are 
available. We have also optimized office 
spaces and occupancy where feasible 
within our lease contract terms. In 2023, 
Paris Origine office received recognition 
and awards from G20, CUBE Flex and 
Ecowatt. We continue to implement our 
Five-Point Action Plans in the group and 
start to deploy Phase 2 actions which 
include more significant investment in 
construction works and major moves or 
renovations to improve energy efficiency. 
The challenge is to continue to reduce our

Approach to quantify scope 3 emissions
Understanding, quantifying, and reducing our indirect CO 2 
emissions across the value chain is integral to our progress 
on the path to net zero. To ensure the highest standard of 
reporting, we have adopted a clear and robust methodology 
based on the globally recognized Greenhouse Gas (GHG) 
Protocol enabling us to accurately quantify and report our 
scope 3 emissions. Our methodology has been reviewed and 
confirmed with the support of well-recognized third parties.
Scope 3 GHG emissions are a mix of several activities and are 
separated into three groups:
■ Upstream, dedicated to the project development phase
(purchased goods and services for projects, upstream
transportation and distribution, waste generated in
operations)
■ Downstream, dedicated to the project operation phase
(downstream transportation and distribution, processing
of sold products, use of sold products, end-of-life
treatment of sold products)
■ Other activities, outside the project phase, which are both
in upstream and downstream
These methodologies also allow us to quantify the carbon 
footprint all along the project life cycle, from feasibility, 
conceptual, going through FEED and EPC proposal, to project 
under execution: we use them to estimate the carbon 
footprint at all stages of the pre-investment phase. 
Unlike manufacturing companies, Technip Energies, with 
some exceptions, does not operate nor own any production 
assets, but provides design, technologies and management 
services for its clients. This unique company profile means 
that scope 1 and 2 emissions are very much limited 
compared to scope 3 emissions.
While the activities not related to projects represent Technip 
Energies’ carbon footprint as an engineering and services 
company, the scope 3 related to projects under execution 
(upstream and downstream) represents Technip Energies’ 
carbon footprint as an EPC contractor. 
For projects that are under execution, the reported carbon 
footprint reflects the progress achieved during the year in 
the same way that annual revenue is reported in our financial 
results following a progressive carbon footprint reporting 
mechanism which counts the emissions based on the 
progress revenue of the projects. 
Scope 3 emissions are highly dependent on our clients’ 
decisions and the location of their projects. Due to the long 
duration of the decision process of our clients, from 
feasibility, conceptual, pre-FEED and FEED to the final 
investment decision of projects, the reduction of our scope 3 
will not be evident immediately but progressively in the 
medium and long-term. We continue to evaluate full scope 3 
downstream emissions to develop a robust methodology and 
action plans that we can share with stakeholders to support 
our decarbonization journey.
The carbon footprint calculation methodology is detailed in 
section 4.2. Definitions and methodologies.
Scope 3 upstream
For the activities not related to projects, thus the activities 
related to our own assets and people, we also continue to 
monitor and improve our GHG emissions.
Related to business travel emissions, Technip Energies uses a 
travel agency service provider to book transportation tickets 
(train, flight, car) and hotel accommodation for business 
travel (scope 3.6). This agency provides a complete report of 
all business trips, excluding hotel accommodation, with the 
calculation of the GHG emissions. 
To assess the GHG emissions of our employee commuting 
(which falls under the scope 3.7 category of indirect 
emissions), we launched our first “My Emissions Employee 
Survey”. From this survey, we obtained responses from 
around 3,500 employees (23%) across different operating 
centers. We then extrapolated these results to represent all 
employees, using the average emission factor per employee. 
The GHG emissions amounted 8,441 tCO 2eq, in line with last 
year’s figure which was fully estimated.
For upstream transportation and distribution (scope 3.4), we 
corrected the emission factor for air transportation to be in 
line with the definition of the GHG protocol, our methodology 
and the emission factor from the international database. This 
correction implied a re-evaluation of the previous years.
The main contributor to the GHG emissions of scope 3 
upstream is scope 3.1 Purchased Goods and Services. 
Technip Energies is committed to building the path to net 
zero. While we are on track to address our direct carbon 
footprint under scopes 1 and 2, we are at the beginning of 
our journey to onboard the decarbonization of our supply 
chain. Actions have been implemented in 2023 for 
sustainable procurement by our Global Sourcing & 
Procurement team, which include new questions and criteria 
related to their carbon footprint in the supplier qualification 
process, and the definition of a monitoring process. 
Organization of the first ESG Supplier Council in November 
2023 gathering 20 of our major suppliers is expected to 
deliver results. The same approach and actions are also being 
implemented for our subcontractors’ chain.
More information is provided in section 3.3.2. Sustainable 
supply chain.
Climate transition plan scope 3: 
step by step to net zero
Our journey towards net zero involves two key strategies: 
decarbonizing our core operations and introducing new 
decarbonization solutions. This positions Technip Energies as 
a pivotal player in achieving net zero emissions. We 
acknowledge the challenges posed by climate change, but we 
also recognize the immense opportunities that come with 
aligning ourselves with the transition to a low-carbon 
economy. This alignment not only enhances our business 
resilience but also opens up new commercial prospects for 
us and our clients while effectively managing the physical 
risks to the Company.
Our strategy is centered on fostering the development of 
innovative technologies and nurturing positive relationships 
with our clients and partners. This collaborative approach 
will help us drive forward new energy solutions such as 
Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS), hydrogen

energy, circular economy practices, and other integrated 
solutions. Our primary challenge is to stay at the forefront of 
the energy transition landscape, which is continually evolving 
due to extensive policy, legal, technological, and market 
changes.
Our teams are deeply committed to a sustainable future and 
understand the importance of reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions for the health of our planet and the well-being of 
future generations. In 2023, our actions were focused on six 
main areas:
■ Carbon in bidding process: We have started estimating
GHG emissions at the early stage of prospect decision-
making, helping to guide our teams (Sales, Tendering,
Estimation, Engineering, Process, and Construction) in
selecting and proposing environmentally friendly solutions
to our clients.
■ Seeking the best technologies:  We launched several
offerings to minimize our clients’ carbon footprint. These
include Capture.Now™, a platform for carbon
transformation, Canopy by T.EN™ for carbon capture,
BlueH2 by T.EN™ for low-carbon hydrogen production, and
SnapLNG by T.EN™ for reducing LNG facilities’ carbon
footprint. These standardized solutions simplify supply
chains, reduce risk, and speed up market entry, aligning
with our net-zero goal and decarbonization market
position. More information is provided in section 1.3.
Decarbonization driving our net zero journey.
Our Technology and Innovation R&D is now fully focused
on the energy transition, mainly in low-carbon solutions
(such as blue hydrogen) and carbon-free solutions (such
as green hydrogen) and is establishing technology
pathways for our clients to achieve their net zero
ambitions. In 2023, we allocated 100% of our Technology
and Innovation R&D efforts to sustainability.
■ Reducing GHG emissions by design: We are aware that the
products we offer as outcomes of our projects have long
life cycles which puts sustainable design at utmost
importance. With this in mind, we have put together a
Catalog of Decarbonization Solutions available to our
clients with the aim of sharing ready-to-implement
solutions for projects.
We also adopted a GHG Emissions Charter aiming at
reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. This global
initiative, spearheaded by our operating centers, marks a
significant step in our commitment to a sustainable
future. The charter focuses in particular on responsible
design to lower emissions both from our supply chain and
from the usage of the infrastructures, technologies and
products that we deliver.
■ Reducing GHG emissions in project execution:  Our teams
adopt best practices in all aspects of our business
operations to reduce our carbon footprint. We actively
seek opportunities to reduce energy consumption, waste,
and carbon emissions in construction sites. For clients’
project sites, the share of renewable electricity remains
limited (less than 1%), nevertheless we constantly keep on
proposing electrified solutions (e-LNG and e-furnaces).
Intelex is our internal reporting tool for all HSE
accountable projects, which automatically calculates the
equivalence in carbon dioxide emissions (CO 2eq) of the
energy used, the material purchased locally (steel,
concrete, etc.) and the waste generated at project sites.
This calculation enables our project teams to monitor
their impact on the climate on a monthly basis and adapt
their operations where possible.
■ Collective intelligence:  In 2023, we continued to deploy
the Climate Fresk, our teams trained another 1,300 people
and 50 facilitators. This year, Climate Fresk workshops
were held in Italy, UK, Thailand, Qatar, UAE and France.
■ Partnering with our customers, suppliers, and
subcontractors: Many partnerships and alliances have
been formed this year to accelerate the journey to net
zero: with John Cockerill, for the creation of Rely, with
Casale, for decarbonized blue hydrogen production units,
with Lanzajet Alcohol-to-Jet production units, and with
IBM and Under Armour to create Reju, a new company for
the development of an innovative technology for plastic
fiber regeneration. More information is provided in section
1.4. Joining forces and bridging expertise across industries.
We are actively engaging with our stakeholders along our
value chain to develop innovative solutions that reduce
our scope 3 emissions and support our clients’ own
emissions reduction goals. Notably, in 2023 we held our
our ESG Supplier Council gathering 20 major suppliers
across the globe to exchange best practices and identified
opportunities for acceleration and continuous
improvement of sustainability path together, like green
manufacturing, green transport & logistics.
We embedded the carbon footprint requirements into the
selection process of our suppliers and subcontractors,
from prequalification to the awarding of the purchase
orders and subcontracts.
A Catalog of Decarbonization Solutions
To support the commercial teams around the world, 
the One T.EN Delivery team has developed a catalog 
which references all the environmental solutions 
available. In one centralized database, the commercial 
teams can select the technologies which correspond 
with client requests for quotation (RFQ), to identify and 
compare environmental gains against cost and planning, 
or implementation difficulty. The catalog provides 
multiple decarbonization options with potential CO2 
emissions reduction. It also provides detailed 
information and project references. The information has 
been compiled by experts for each technology, making 
it easy to contact the relevant person whenever more 
detail is needed.
As an example, the flue-gas recovery units (FGRU) 
eliminate the need for continuous flaring of gas on gas 
producing facilities and petrochemical plants. The 
system saves gas, reduces GHG emissions and 
optimizes auxiliaries (utilities, OPEX). With high 
environmental gains and low costs, the system is easy 
to implement.
The catalog is a go-to reference when preparing a 
proposal. It provides reliable and up-to-date 
information on the best practices and technologies in 
the field. It enables us to present the most 
decarbonized solutions, answer questions about 
efficiency and costs, and influence clients to select the 
most sustainable solutions.
Achieving net zero is testimony to our dedication to integrate 
sustainability at the core of our business. As a leading 
engineering and technology company, we are in a unique 
position to accelerate collective transformation for a just and 
equitable transition towards a low-carbon future. Being an 
influential company within this field requires us to be at the 
forefront of ambitions to reach net zero by 2050. We must 
not only prioritize meeting stakeholder expectations for this 
purpose, but set an example for the whole industry.

Avoided Emissions
The identification, calculation, and application of avoided 
emissions of our solutions is a complex process. 
When we initiated our methodology in 2022, we focused on 
the reporting of avoided emissions for carbon capture 
projects only. This scope represents the reduction of our 
clients’ emissions achieved thanks to our solutions compared 
to a reference scenario or baseline without the solutions. 
Based on this approach and applying the progressive carbon 
footprint reporting mechanism of the projects used for 
scope  3, the avoided emissions were 1.8  million tCO 2eq in 
2021, 7.2  million tCO2eq in 2022, and 10.5  million tCO 2eq in 
2023. 
As we are increasingly working on new technologies and 
proposing a wider range of low-carbon and decarbonization 
solutions to our clients, we will revise our approach. We have 
started to draft a methodology to quantify Technip Energies 
GHG avoided emissions related to projects, based on the 
Climate Avoided Emissions guidance published in March 2023 
by the WBCSD/Net Zero Initiative. This involves a step-by-
step approach to ensure eligibility and quantification of the 
avoided emissions. This new methodology will be used for 
reporting from 2024 onwards, extending the calculation of 
avoided emissions to other technologies upon award of 
contracts.
3.1.3. Reducing our ecological footprint 
to protect biodiversity
At Technip Energies, we are committed to reinforcing action 
towards the conservation of nature and biodiversity. By 
joining Act4Nature International in 2022, which brings 
together academics, peers, and NGO representatives, we 
formally agreed to meet shared commitments and define our 
own commitments.
This plan consists of three pillars:
1. To avoid adverse impacts of our operations on the most
sensitive areas of biodiversity;
2. To assess and manage risks to reduce our potential
impacts;
3. To mobilize all stakeholders (clients, suppliers,
employees).
In 2023, Technip Energies took important strides in our 
commitment to biodiversity preservation. We integrated this 
ambition into our ESG scorecard, ensuring zero projects in 
areas classified under IUCN management categories I and II.
To further our efforts, we introduced comprehensive internal 
guidelines for biodiversity management. These guidelines are 
designed to assist our customers and teams in formulating 
effective action plans for their projects, even during the 
design phase.
Key Achievements of 2023
Pollution
As stated in Technip Energies’ HSES policy, our fundamental 
conviction is that all incidents are preventable. All operating 
centers, sites and projects have an environment management 
system to capture any adverse events with environmental 
impact, including weak signals, near-misses, and negligible 
incidents.
We encourage our sites to report all events, contributing to 
the avoidance of potentially more severe incidents for the 
environment. In 2023, we modified our internal procedure to 
facilitate the severity evaluation of events using objective 
criteria: 
1. The hazard profile of the substance involved (based on
the safety data sheet).
2. Thresholds for the estimated volumes spilled.
3. Sensitivity of the surrounding ecosystems.
Hydraulic oil is the most common substance spilled, but 
substances can also include bitumen, paint, or wastewater. 
As a result, we saw a decrease in the number of 
environmental incidents with significant impact from 4 in 
2022 to 1 in 2023 and improved the quality of the severity 
evaluation.
Nitrogen and sulfur emissions as well as other air pollutants 
emitted during operations are also recorded on a monthly 
basis. In 2023, the volume of these emissions increased as 
one of our projects in Bahrain entered the commissioning 
phase, and an FPSO entered the towing phase. Both phases 
entail high fuel consumption. 
Details are provided in section 4.1.1. Environmental indicators 
in the air emissions table.
Some actions to help clients reduce pollution include: 
■ A smart Leak Detection and Repair (“ LDAR”) Program to
monitor and reduce methane emissions for immediate
implementation upon startup has been developed in 2023
for an important client by our process and engineering
teams, for setup and future delivery.
■ Noise reduction for industrial installations: our team of
acoustic experts specify, model and check equipment
vendors’ data and intervene on site to carry out acoustic
performance guarantee tests. That was the case at the
end of 2023 on a large floating LNG unit offshore East
Africa.
Water
Water is essential to the progress of humanity. Food 
production, electricity generation, manufacturing among 
many other activities, all depend on it.
Technip Energies targets 50% of water withdrawals by our 
sites to come from reused water sources by 2025, including 
collected rainwater, and internally and externally treated 
wastewater.
In 2023, 12.6% of water withdrawals came from reused water 
sources, below our performance in 2022 (19%) due to overall 
increase of mega projects water consumption and reduced 
opportunities for reuse in 2023. 
On the other side, the percentage of recycled water 
discharged (effluent) increased to 74%, compared to 22% in 
2022, as treated wastewater from a project in Qatar has been 
reused for local irrigation.

In parallel, Technip Energies continues to make strides in 
advancing sustainable water practices in engineering. In 2023, 
our experts have been actively involved in several projects 
and studies, to develop knowledge in water and effluent 
management for green hydrogen production and its 
derivatives, carbon capture units from various sources, 
lithium production and plastic recycling. Through these 
projects, Technip Energies has proposed technical solutions 
to meet specific clients’ challenges, such as high purity water 
production, heavy metals and dioxin removal and effluent 
recycling up to zero liquid discharge minimizing the volumes 
of water required to operate and the risk of water pollution.
Furthermore, the Global Environment and Digital teams have 
developed a geographical mapping of our local risk exposure 
to water stress level. Based on the World Resource Initiative 
(WRI) Aqueduc platform, which reflects both current 
conditions and future projections of water supply, demand, 
stress, and more, we can assess that for Technip Energies 
HSE-accountable sites: 17% (12 sites) are located in low and 
low to medium risk areas, 34% (23 sites) in medium to high 
risk areas, 28% (19) in high risk areas, and 6% (4 sites) in 
extreme high risk areas. 
In 2024, we will remain mobilized to achieve our 
sustainability ambition to reduce our pressure on water 
resource by implementing the following action plan:
1. Prioritize our efforts for our main contributors, mostly
large projects, by helping them to act through detailed
site mapping of the water use in the early phases, and
providing monitoring data and support to subcontractors.
2. Enhance our global water internal standard by taking into
account our teams’ success, our lessons-learned, and the
newly calculated water risk level at site, in order to clarify
the appropriate mitigation measures.
3. Share even more widely with our clients the best
solutions developed by our experts, based on our track
record of performance, notably related to effluent
recycling up to zero-liquid-discharge allowing the water
loop to be closed.
4. Raise awareness among our employees about the impact
of water wastage. To this end, in 2023 we joined a French
initiative called “ Éco d'Eau” (Save Water), involving public
and private stakeholders. It will consist in 2024 of
deploying a communication campaign to help change
behaviors when possible.
Water reuse: Neste Rotterdam Site Development
The expansion of Neste’s renewable products refinery in 
Rotterdam involved hydrotesting four massive holding 
tanks totaling 54,000 m3, equivalent to 21 Olympic 
swimming pools! The sequencing of these tests was 
organized to minimize consumption of municipal water, 
maximize water reuse, and minimize water discharge 
after testing.
After testing the first tank, the water was then filtered 
and quality tested before being transferred to the second 
tank, then the third, and on to the fourth, before being 
treated and discharged. Overall, this process successfully 
saved 37,000 m3 of water. 
This example highlights the importance of taking water 
constraints into account at the earliest stages of project 
planning and construction to facilitate the transfer and 
reuse of water from one area of a project to another.
Protecting flora and fauna
At Technip Energies, we are committed to preserving 
biodiversity. We believe that every team member plays a 
crucial role in this mission. Today, more than 1,500 
employees have followed the dedicated e-learning titled 
‘Biodiversity preservation at Technip Energies’. This module 
aims to increase awareness about the importance of 
biodiversity protection and the specific actions that Technip 
Energies is undertaking to contribute to this global cause.
Our teams worldwide have implemented a variety of 
measures to protect and restore biodiversity. These can be 
broadly classified into two categories:
■ Protection measures , such as the use of zero-phyto
substances during vegetation removal in Mexico, strict
waste management to avoid risk of abandoned items in
Egypt and Qatar, wildlife relocation in Mexico, or workers’
awareness and site inspection in Vietnam and France.
■ Restoration measures , such as tree plantation in India,
Italy, France, and the USA to restore local ecosystems.
Our Houston team has taken relevant strides in biodiversity 
management on a client’s project in Mexico. We have trained 
a specialist team of 11 members who work tirelessly to 
ensure the safety of local wildlife. In 2023, during the 
construction phase, we successfully relocated 151 individual 
fauna, including 78% reptiles, 19% mammals, and 3% poultry. 
These animals were moved to approved relocation points 
within the client’s property, located 3 km away from the 
project site.
Each environmental leader from our subcontractors is well-
versed in fauna and flora, ensuring that every action taken is 
in the best interests of the local ecosystem. We have also 
partnered with Big Consultores, a specialized firm, to 
preserve the local flora in a nursery. Once the pre-
commissioning works on site are completed, all the 
preserved flora will be transferred to the relocation points 
for reforestation.
Through these measures, we are not just working on a 
project, we are actively contributing to the preservation and 
restoration of local biodiversity.

3.1.4. Promoting a Circular Economy
Ahead of the World Circular Economy Forum 2023, the 
European Investment Bank Vice-President said: 
At Technip Energies, being circular is in our DNA. It means 
focusing our action and planning on the following elements 
when conducting a project or managing a site: 
■ Eco-design: by conducting studies to anticipate the
environmental impact at the early stages of processes and
minimize externalities of our projects, products or
services.
■ Sustainable procurement:  by incorporating sustainability
criteria into the supplier and subcontractor qualification
process, and by studying how to support our partners in
the improvement of their environmental performances.
■ Responsible consumption:  by minimizing the use of
energy, water, and materials whenever possible,
recovering a maximum of water consumed, waste and
wastewater generated at our sites.
Eco-design
At the heart of our businesses, eco-design is the most 
effective driver to reduce environmental impact. This means 
considering the environmental impact of any technology, 
product, or service throughout its life cycle. Data is at the 
heart of our eco-design approach, allowing us to know which 
process, material or component causes the biggest impact, 
and thereby focus our efforts and value our success.
At Technip Energies, our teams have a wealth of experience 
of Design Environmental Impact Identification (“ ENVID”), 
allowing recommendations to be made for a safer and more 
environmental friendly design and project execution. 
In 2023, all the projects managed by the Paris and Rome 
Operating Centers underwent a design ENVID review. The 
Paris team strives to improve its efficiency via enhanced 
digitalization of the data leading to more accurate and 
proactive management of issues.
Among the numerous consulting services we offer, our 
affiliate Genesis provides our clients with a regular review of 
Best Available Techniques (“ BAT”) to prevent and control 
industrial emissions of pollutants, especially for projects 
located in Europe.
In 2023, Technip Energies enhanced its capabilities in eco 
design by applying Life Cycle Assessment (“ LCA”). LCA is a 
methodology for assessing the environmental impacts of a 
product, process, or service throughout its life cycle, from 
raw materials to disposal.
Our process and engineering teams in Paris have also 
developed a catalog of environmental solutions for our 
customers, with the aim of sharing ready-to-implement 
solutions for projects. The scope of this catalog will be 
progressively extended to valorize all the existing solutions 
developed by Technip Energies’ operating centers across the 
globe. 
Processium
Technip Energies acquired Processium, an expert 
company in process development, in July 2023. With 
its process lab located in Lyon, not far from Technip 
Energies France, the two companies complement each 
other in two important fields: technology scouting and 
process design. 
Processium’s mission is to design, improve, and optimize 
processes, integrating sustainability assessment at the 
earliest stage of project development. With activity in 
specialty chemicals, industrial biotechnology and bio-
based industries, and clients from startups to 
multinational companies, Processium helps its clients 
by evaluating new technologies in the lab, testing 
performance, and managing risks, before the launch 
of a pilot or demonstration plant. This is where Technip 
Energies can come in, taking the technology to the next 
level of readiness, with basic and detailed engineering, 
licensing, and plant construction. 
There are several areas where Technip Energies and 
Processium have already started collaborating, most 
notably in connection with Reju to recycle polyester 
textiles. Many more opportunities have been identified 
in the field of carbon capture and conversion of CO2 into 
chemicals, as well as in biotech for bio-based industries. 
Processium’s skills in life cycle assessment (LCA) are 
also important for the development of eco-design. 
LCA is a tool used to identify gaps in process 
development and enable the right selection of 
technologies for a circular economy. Addressing the 
process life cycle from the earliest design phase 
produces the most positive long-term impact.

It is very clear today that 
there can be no transition 
to a carbon-neutral economy 
without a transition to a circular 
economy, one where we keep 
resources in use for as long 
as possible and significantly 
reduce waste.”

Sustainable procurement
Ensuring the alignment of our supply chain with our 
environmental ambitions is essential for Technip Energies to 
achieve its targets and objectives.
Working with our Construction and Procurement departments, 
we introduced a new pre-qualification questionnaire in 2023. 
This document forms part of our standard tender documents 
sent to our main subcontractors and suppliers so that we 
have essential information before starting a qualification 
process. New environmental questions have been integrated 
into this questionnaire in relation to climate, energy, water, 
material, and waste. The answers from our suppliers allow us to 
evaluate their maturity in terms of qualitative and quantitative 
performance. Suppliers are evaluated based on defined 
thresholds (low, medium, high levels of performances) according 
to our business standards. 
In 2024, we will continue our journey by monitoring the 
implementation of this questionnaire and supporting our 
supply chain in the continuous improvement of its 
performance when needed. One key instrument of this 
support is the ESG supplier council that we initiated in 2023. 
This organization provides an excellent forum to share best 
practices and to align ambitions and targets.
See more in section 3.3.2. Sustainable supply chain.
Responsible consumption and waste management
In 2023, all our teams have continued to conduct initiatives, 
in projects, offices and industrial sites, to reverse resource 
consumption and footprint trends. The aim is to encourage 
everyone to question their own behavior and comply with our 
strict philosophy of waste minimization, and recycling as a 
last instance.
Many local initiatives have been introduced in our offices, 
such as:
• Employees can now be informed of the carbon footprint
of their meal at the Paris office restaurant.
• Elimination of single-use plastic remains a priority for
many of our offices, including those in Kuala Lumpur,
Rome, Chennai, New Delhi and Houston.
• Numerous campaigns have been conducted to raise
awareness concerning waste segregation for recycling
(electronic, batteries, etc.), in Houston and Abu Dhabi.
On projects sites also, our teams show strong commitment 
avoiding waste accumulation and pollution. This is reflected 
in our good performance.
As per our ESG Scorecard, we aim to recycle 85% of the 
waste generated by our offices, industrial sites, and projects 
by 2025. In 2023, 91% of the waste was recycled, notably 
thanks to one of our best practices at our construction sites 
that involves reusing soil and dredging material in situ (soil 
processed) in our mega projects.
Technip Energies aims to help our clients respond to their 
customers’ demands for more sustainably developed and 
sourced products. We are committed to providing a recycling 
solution for each of our plastic technologies to contribute to 
the circular economy.
In 2023, Technip Energies announced the creation of Reju, a 
new company focused on textile PET recycling leveraging the 
innovative technology co-developed in joint-venture with IBM 
and Under Armour. Reju is focused on creating new solutions 
at scale for the vast amount of plastic fiber in textiles that 
goes unrecycled and ends up as waste. See more in 
section 1.5.5. Reju of the 2023 Annual Report.

TOTAL 13,530 1,968 12,639 1,876
TOTAL 15,498 14,515
In 2023, our headcount increased by 6.7% compared to 2022, 
most notably in Europe, to support the increase in LNG 
projects managed or executed by the Paris Operating Center. 
A collaborative workload-sharing arrangement with India 
resulted in the establishment of new added value centers. 
Additionally, we grew our workforce in the Americas thanks 
to the initiation of various new energy projects. 
In 2023, 345 employees were employed by Technip Energies 
in the Netherlands. Over the same period, 15,153 employees 
were employed outside of the Netherlands. 
The breakdown below shows the number of employees in 
corporate functions, in main operating centers (where we 
carry out engineering studies as well as R&D) and in other 
centers supporting operations (e.g., temporary offices in 
support of a project, commercial offices).

Turnover rate
In the intricate context of our organizational landscape, the 
metrics of employee turnover serve as a compass, guiding us 
through the nuanced dynamics of our workforce. Upon 
reflection of the year 2023, we observe a comprehensive 
turnover rate encompassing transitions across permanent, 
fixed-term, and apprentice roles, measuring at 16.1, %, as 
compared to the 19.1% rate recorded in 2022.
This metric is derived from the total number and rate of our 
employee turnover during the reporting period, with the 
numerator of those who left voluntarily or due to dismissal, 
retirement, or the solemnity of death in service. This figure is 
then harmonized with the average headcount of our 
employees between the beginning and end of the reporting 
period. For 2024 we are already revamping the CSRD 
reporting implementation and hence we are using the new 
definition and calculation method. 
Zooming in on the specifics of permanent attrition driven by 
voluntary decisions, the ratio for the year 2023 stands at 
9.9%, a notable decrease from the 11.1% recorded In 2022. 
This metric focuses on the total number and rate of 
permanent employee turnover resulting from voluntary 
termination during the reporting period. The numerator 
includes those permanent employees who chose to bid 
farewell voluntarily, while the denominator provides an 
average headcount of our permanent workforce between the 
initiation and culmination of the reporting period.
With this understanding, we embark on a journey of analysis 
and reflection, seeking to refine our Talent Acquisition and 
Management strategies, enhance our work environment, and 
foster a culture that not only attracts but retains the 
invaluable talent that propels our organization forward.
We will continue to analyze this metric to improve our 
understanding to cultivate and retain a thriving and resilient 
workforce.
The decrease in turnover in our organization compared to the 
previous year can be attributed to several key factors that 
have contributed to a more stable and engaged workforce. 
One of the main drivers is our strategic recruitment efforts 
that focus on attracting individuals who are not only well-
qualified but also share and embody our organizational 
values. We have also implemented enhanced retention 
initiatives, such as our T.EN University launch which provides 
personal development opportunities for employees, as well 
as individual development plans that are supported by mid-
year development discussions.
An additional contributing factor to our reduced turnover rate 
is the results from our recent employee engagement survey, 
MyVoice. The survey results have provided valuable insights 
into areas where our employees feel supported and engaged, 
as well as areas where there may be room for improvement. 
This feedback has allowed us to make targeted adjustments 
and implement new initiatives that address the specific 
needs and preferences of our workforce.
Moreover, an organizational focus on fostering a supportive 
and inclusive work environment through the implementation 
of tailor-made inclusion and engagement country action 
plans.

3.2.2. Health, Safety and Well-being
Technip Energies has placed safety at the core of its values 
and is committed to ensuring the health, safety, and well-
being of all its employees and the people we work with. This 
is defined in our global HSE standards, which are the 
foundations of our HSE culture and leadership. This aligns 
with our focus on caring for people. PULSE, our Global HSE 
Culture and engagement program, is designed to extend HSE 
principles to all those we work and live with.
Establishing global HSE standards
Our Global HSE and Security Policy  sets our absolute 
commitment to the Health, Safety, Environment and Security 
(“HSES”) of all those who can either directly or indirectly be 
affected by our business activities. Our policy also ensures 
that health, safety, environment and security are managed as 
an integral part of our business and are based on a genuine 
care and concern for people and the environment. We do not 
compromise on quality, safety, health, security, or 
environmental sustainability to achieve our financial 
objectives.
A key element of our HSE management system is our set of 
global HSE management standards, which are applicable to 
all our sites and projects. After harmonizing all our HSE 
standards in 2022, 2023 was the year of structural 
implementation of these standards and of paying close 
attention to our main HSE Management systems like BBS, 
PULSE & QHSES Leadership Visits. Health checks were 
implemented, Train the Trainer sessions defined and 
digitalization of these programs was further developed.
In addition, 77% of our operations are certified ISO 45001, the 
international standard occupational health and safety 
management systems, testament to Group’s responsible 
commitment.
PULSE program
PULSE is our flagship engagement program 
that puts HSE at the heart of our 
operations. It focuses on physical and 
mental well-being to promote a work 
environment where we look after one 
another. 
PULSE is for everyone, no matter what role 
we have. It is a leadership program 
designed to train people about their HSE responsibilities and 
create a HSE culture that integrates the importance of 
influence and expectations. Five tailored training modules 
have been deployed to  engage employees at all levels of the 
Technip Energies organization including clients and sub-
contractors. These include:
■ Pulse HSE Leadership
■ Pulse for Engineering
■ Pulse for Frontline Supervision to engage subcontractor
personnel
■ Pulse for Site Managers and Supervisors
■ Pulse for the Office, the newly revamped module with
high focus on Environment.
The program encourages everyone to identify actions within 
their scope of responsibility that can influence HSE 
performance at all levels of the Company. It has been 
designed to be engaging and interactive, by taking a discovery 
learning approach with role plays and gamified activities. In 
2023, 575 training sessions took place at our Operating 
Centers with over 9,000 participants. In addition, PULSE is 
now part of the newcomer onboarding process thanks to a 
new e-learning program. The program will allow us to move 
to the same beat, and work better and more safely together.
Behavior-based safety (BBS) program
We don’t compromise on Safety. It is entrenched in our 
Values. We carry out regular health and safety training, we 
have dedicated safety moments, and specialized staff. The 
behavior-based safety (“ BBS”) program involves training 
observers to observe workers on site, to identify blockers 
that prevent safe execution, and to discuss ways of making 
work safer. Observers are not inspectors, instead they 
encourage a very positive approach to HSE on site by 
acknowledging and reinforcing safe behavior. Their findings 
are then raised at site steering committees to discuss what 
improvements can be made. All eligible projects, managed 
and controlled by Technip Energies, now have the BBS 
program in place.
To make sure that safe behavior becomes automatic, we 
have designed a knowledge retention program to identify 
what gets forgotten. We have a dedicated team on project 
sites, whose role is to question workers and identify safety 
knowledge gaps, so that we can provide targeted training 
programs and reactivate knowledge to required levels. We 
are continuously measuring, training and re-measuring, it’s an 
ongoing process from the moment a project starts, right 
through to completion. 
In 2023, we identified 15 eligible construction sites for the 
BBS program and all of them were trained and delivered the 
BBS program by the end of the year.
QHSES Leadership Visits Program
The Technip Energies’ Leadership Visit program is a key 
driver for our business and fosters a Quality, Health, Safety, 
Environment & Security (“QHSES”) Leadership Culture, driven 
by a practical and visible engagement, and reinforcing our 
QHSES values. It is a workplace visit in which the Leadership 
Team positively engages workforce/employees in a proactive 
and positive QHSES conversation. It relies on management 
acumen and skills to initiate dialogue, engage discussion with 
the workforce and listen actively, identify areas of 
improvement, but also recognize behavior demonstrating 
outstanding QHSES work practices.

Our first HSE Forum brings together global firms
Our first ever Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) Forum 
held in Paris from 21-22 November, brought together senior 
HSE representatives from 12 global companies, under the 
theme, “Be HSE Future-Ready”. These companies often work 
with us on joint projects and have a mutual interest in 
improving HSE conditions.
The Forum provided the opportunity to foster collaboration, 
with participants sharing information and discussing ideas on 
topics such as how to achieve zero incidents and leverage 
new technologies during workshops on “Expected Behavior 
and Knowledge Driving Goal Zero” and “New Technologies 
Within HSE”.
Safety results
All our health and safety training is designed to prevent 
accidents and ensure the safety of all staff in the workplace. 
It is a continuous process and must always be our priority.
Technip Energies is an engineering company, but when we 
carry out projects, we are onboarding many operators. Even 
though they are not employed by the Company, these 
operators become our responsibility once they enter our 
sites. All safety incidents are recorded, and we target the 
total recordable injury rate (“ TRIR”) to remain below 0.1 per 
200,000 hours worked as we strive to ensure zero fatalities. 
These are lagging indicators, and at the same time we are 
working on leading indicators which include BBS 
implementation, safety leadership visits, risk reduction 
projects and environmental incident reporting to improve 
safety, for everyone under our responsibility.
Thanks to these measures, in 2023 we recorded zero 
fatalities and the severity of our incidents has decreased by 
72% compared to 2022. We saw an improvement in the Lost 
Time Injury Rate (“LTIR”), which decreased from 0.02 in 2022 
to 0.01, while the Total Recordable Incident Rate (“TRIR”) has 
increased to 0.11 as project activity and number of hours 
worked increased. 
Our track record on major projects is illustrative of this 
performance:
■ BAPCO Project: 78 million worked hours without Lost
Time Injury (“LTI”);
■ Long Son Project: 36 million worked hours without LTI;
■ PP Nayara: 15 million worked hours without LTI;
■ Assiut Project: 12 million worked hours without LTI;
■ Sempra Project: 10 million worked hours without LTI;
■ PTA Project: 10 million worked hours without LTI;
■ MMY Dahej Yard: 7 million worked hours without LTI.

Ensuring the safety of our solutions
At Technip Energies, the HSE risk and opportunities 
management process is embedded throughout the life cycle 
of all projects, from engineering to operational phases.
To ensure that the projects we deliver to our clients are 
secure and reliable for their operations, and that our 
products meet the safety standards for their users, we 
systematically conduct Hazard Identification and Risk 
Assessment (“ HAZID”) and Hazard and Operability Studies 
(“HAZOP”).
HAZID is a systematic approach to identify and evaluate the 
risks posed by unplanned events or hazards on the workers’ 
health and safety and the environment. For each hazard, we 
assess the probability and severity of the potential 
consequences and define the appropriate mitigation 
measures. We conduct HAZID reviews at different stages of 
the project scope, covering both the operational and 
technological risks of the plant. We follow the Technip 
Energies HAZID Guideline, unless the Clients or other 
compliance obligations specify otherwise.
HAZOP is a structured review technique to examine the 
design of process facilities and identify any deviations from 
the design intent that could pose a threat to the safety or 
operability of the plant. We perform HAZOP studies with a 
multi-disciplinary team, using simple guide words to prompt 
the team to consider possible deviations and their causes, 
effects, and safeguards. 
In 2023, we established the objective of ensuring that, by 
2025, all of our FEED projects issue a HAZID close-out report 
before completion, by reporting the actions closed and the 
ones addressed to detailed design phase, and all of our 
detailed design projects issued a HAZOP close-out report 
before the finalization of engineering.
Measuring client satisfaction
Our quality and commercial teams measure client 
satisfaction at different times of our projects: during the win-
it phase, by collecting feedback on tenders we have won or 
lost and during the do-it phase. Surveys cover quality but 
also HSE, project management and execution, client relations 
with clients, schedule and compliance, adequacy of 
resources, commercial management, and post-delivery 
performance. We collect more than 200 surveys per year and 
get a high approval rating of 8.6/10 in 2023 as per our Quality 
Global Standard Method. It is a great achievement, which we 
aim to improve in the future.
Medical - Working on project sites 
Expatriation and/or long-term missions
Working abroad on major projects and/or remote locations 
requires preparation and the ability to respond to medical 
emergencies. Technip Energies has developed three main 
processes: 
■ a medical management plan (“ MMP”), prepared in
cooperation with clients, peers and contractors, to assess
the required medical facilities in the surroundings of a
project and adapt the medical support needed for each
project worksite;
■ a health risk assessment (“ HRA”) for all sites where
Technip Energies  employees are involved; this is to
mitigate health risks present at each work location and
implement appropriate prevention; and
■ a medical emergency response plan (“ MERP”) providing
information for what to do in the case of medical events
that need specific treatments not available at worksite
medical facilities.
These tools are the 3 main pillars of Technip Energies’ Health 
Policy. These are essential and are monitored regularly to 
ensure adaptation to all specific needs.
Ensuring the health of each employee 
Working far from home, on isolated sites, in complex 
countries, away from family, and facing different cultures 
requires good physical and mental health. Technip Energies 
supports each employee in a medical assessment/screening 
before any expatriation to ensure that they will face no higher 
health risk than in their home country, and to assess and 
mitigate any additional risks.
This medical assessment is carried out in the employee’s 
home country. It can be repeated upon arrival in the country 
of expatriation and is adapted to the specificities of each job. 
Medical surveillance is carried out on a regular basis to 
ensure employees are in good health throughout their 
mobilization abroad.
Employee well-being and mental health
“My Voice” - Actively listening to our employees 
The focus on employee well-being 
remains high at Technip Energies. 
In addition to the psychosocial risk 
monitoring required by law in some 
countries, in 2022, Technip 
Energies launched a global 
employee engagement survey 
named “My Voice”, in collaboration with an independent firm 
to guarantee the anonymity of respondents. The survey has 
been designed to provide feedback about employee work 
experience, and detect employee engagement through 
feedback in 18 different categories related to the main 
aspects of people's experience at Technip Energies 
worldwide. 
In 2023, over 12,800 employees were invited to answer the 
second edition of this survey. The percentage of respondents 
increased to 82% compared to 71% in 2022, with 84% of 
respondents declaring that they are proud to work for 
Technip Energies, 80% having a sense of personal 
accomplishment, 79% intending to stay with the Company in 
the next 12 months, and 78% recommending Technip Energies 
as a great place to work. Overall, there were improvements in 
all 18 categories. 
Client focus, HSE, Manager relations, Ethics, and Integrity 
have been confirmed as our solid strengths, thanks to 
specific actions undertaken such as learning paths for 
managers, the launch of “My Development” and our “Integrity 
@ the core ” program. Nurturing a great place to work in all 
dimensions of the employee experience is a long journey, and 
for this reason, we are committed to continuing to add value 
and enhance work experience at Technip Energies. 
Local initiatives to translate well-being ambition into 
concrete actions for employees 
Many local initiatives, which have the advantage of being 
accepted and adapted to the culture of employees, are taking 
the lead on well-being matters in countries across the 
Technip Energies organization. Some 2023 highlights include:
■ A dedicated well-being policy providing information to
employees about available supports related to
environmental, financial, ethical, digital, mental, and
physical well-being – issued in the Netherlands and UAE.
■ The role of Mental Health First Aider has been created,
providing support to employees for primary prevention
(actions to prevent individuals from developing mental
health problems) and secondary prevention (actions taken
when an individual shows signs of mental health problems

or is at risk) – in business clusters such as the UAE, 
Genesis, Milton Keynes, Asia Pacific, and Paris.
■ For tertiary prevention (i.e., actions taken after the onset
of mental health problems in order to help the individual
rehabilitate in the workplace), specific locations/countries
such as Abu Dhabi, India, Australia, Paris, Vietnam,
Malaysia, China, Thailand, and UK have implemented
hotlines (preserving anonymity and usually available in
several languages) that people can call when they feel
they need medical assistance or advice related to physical
and mental health matters.
Ambassadors of well-being 
To provide additional support, over 100 Ambassadors for 
Mental Health and Well-Being have been trained throughout 
the Company, to be attentive to their colleagues, identify 
early warning signs, and provide early support. At present, 
Mental Health First Aiders and Well-Being Ambassadors, 
although numerous, are not yet present in all Technip 
Energies’ operating centers. However, we intend to increase 
the Ambassador network in collaboration with the operating 
centers.
Furthermore, the “Pulse for Office” global program includes a 
the dedicated mental health training module to enhance 
employee awareness, with additional reference to the 
protection of the physical, mental, and emotional well-being 
of individuals, increasing knowledge among employees 
regarding psychosocial risks and their impact.
At Group level in 2023, an updated standard for crisis and 
accident management was revised, which included post-
accident actions related to human aspects. In particular, the 
standard defines response actions and strategies related to 
Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) with the aim of 
providing appropriate care and support for all those who have 
been affected by an incident.
For Technip Energies, employee well-being is integral to our 
values and commitments. In 2024, a thorough analysis of all 
local initiatives will be conducted to harmonize them in 
accordance with local D&I specificities. This will contribute to 
Technip Energies' ambition to design a global core benefit 
program that will provide to our employees a harmonized and 
common ground of benefits wherever they operate, 
embedding basic coverage needs as well as reflecting as 
much as possible well-being expectations from today’s 
society.
3.2.3. People Development
As we strive for continuous growth and a future marked by 
sustainability, our employees are the driving force behind our 
transformative initiatives. To thrive in this ever-changing 
paradigm, embracing innovation becomes imperative. This 
entails not only attracting talents and skills but also engaging 
our teams while fostering a culture of continuous learning 
throughout the organization. Managing and nurturing 
expertise and unique skills are paramount to our success. 
Our commitment to the People Development journey remains 
unwavering, dedicated to fostering and inspiring learning for 
every individual and collectively enabling each employee to 
bloom.
As we grow in a fast-changing environment and transition to 
a more sustainable tomorrow, employees are the human 
engine to achieve this transformation. The energy transition 
means reinventing the way we live and the way we do things. 
We don’t have a choice. To succeed, we need to do things 
differently. This means attracting new talents with new skills, 
enhancing the learning mindset across the Company, and 
managing our expertise and critical skills. Our People 
Development journey aims to support an inspiring learning 
journey for all. 
Inspiring and engaging with a new 
Employee Value Proposition 
Elaborating on our strategy, we embarked on a 
transformative journey by launching our Employee Value 
Proposition (“EVP”) strategy, a collective vision crafted with 
the invaluable input of our global workforce. Through a 
meticulous process involving employee feedback, leadership 
insights, external stakeholder engagement, creative 
workshops, and benchmark analyses, we have designed an 
EVP that resonates with our commitment to accelerate the 
energy transition. 
Our EVP revolves around a compelling promise to both our 
employees and candidates: “Become an energy game-
changer and engineer a sustainable future”. This commitment 
is underlined by a powerful call to action, urging everyone to 
“Be part of the solution”. These phrases encapsulate the 
essence of our organization and how our workforce is 
actively shaping the energy industry while addressing the 
pressing challenges of climate change. 
Structured around six pillars, our EVP provides a 
comprehensive framework for understanding the experiences 
of our employees, each supported by tangible proof points. 
■ Sustainable Future
We stand as pioneers in solving energy challenges,
translating today's priorities into tangible, sustainable
solutions for a better future. This pillar exemplifies our
dedication to creating lasting impacts and advancing the
cause of global sustainability.
■ Skills for Tomorrow
Focused on the career development journey of our
employees, this pillar highlights our commitment to
cultivating a learning environment. We invest in our
workforce, ensuring they possess the skills necessary to
drive the energy transition forward.
■ Innovative Mindset
Demonstrating our dedication to making the net zero
journey a reality, this pillar showcases our advancements
through substantial investments in Research and
Development. Our innovative mindset is key to pioneering
sustainable solutions.
■ Many Voices, One Team
Central to our EVP is the collaborative culture fostered in
this pillar. It emphasizes our employees' ability to connect
and collaborate seamlessly, ensuring the successful
delivery of energy projects worldwide.
■ Inclusive Culture
Celebrating diversity, our EVP promotes an inclusive
environment where talents from around the world come
together. We believe in harnessing the power of diverse
perspectives to drive innovation and positive change.
■ Safe Environment
Our commitment to a world-class safety culture is
encapsulated in this pillar. We prioritize creating a secure
and caring environment for our employees, recognizing the
importance of their well-being.
In essence, our EVP is more than a mere statement; it is a 
profound commitment, echoing our Purpose and Values. It 
symbolizes our dedication to being at the forefront of the 
energy transition, illustrating how each employee contributes

to this monumental task. Together, we are not just 
employees; we are architects of a sustainable future. More 
than ever, employees are the engine to achieve our 
transformation. It means attracting new talents, developing 
new skills, and engaging everyone on our People 
Development journey. 
Enhancing candidate experience 
and talent acquisition capabilities
2023 is characterized by our efforts to enhance the 
attractiveness of Technip Energies for candidates, advance 
our early career offerings, and grow our Talent Acquisition 
(“TA”) capabilities aiming to solidify our organization against 
the rapidly changing (labor) market conditions. Concretely, 
we continued reskilling and upskilling our TA professionals to 
ensure quality but also diverse hires. Our focus remained on 
enticing young talents and seasoned professionals, this year 
supported with claims and visuals through our EVP. 
Simultaneously, we have expanded our technologies and 
tools available enabling data-driven decisions in our TA 
process. Ultimately to eliminate bias and ensure an equal 
chance of selection for all applicants. All to keep enhancing 
our visibility and promise as a world-class employer of 
choice in the Energy Transition landscape. 
Doubling campus management partnerships 
worldwide 
In our efforts to connect with our future workforce, we have 
diversified our channels and engaged with campuses globally. 
In 2023, we participated in 279 activities worldwide, 
establishing connections with 125 new partners. Our strategic 
focus on Asia, Europe and the USA has led to the expansion 
of our campus management practices, notably in regions 
with growing business opportunities, such as France (from 62 
to 85), Italy (from 12 to 27), India (from 16 to 63) and the USA 
(from 16 to 21). The Campus Program strategically targets 
regions where we anticipate intense competition for talent, 
exemplified by our initiative in the UK (from 0 to 14).
To enhance our outreach, we have diversified our campus 
recruitment practices. This includes investing in multiple 
female-focused STEM activities in our operating centers, 
such as those in the UK, participating in graduate speed 
dating programs in France and the Netherlands, and 
implementing a Master Technology Transfer program in 
Azerbaijan in line with our sustainability goals.
Our commitment goes beyond acquiring young talent; we aim 
to contribute to their (early) development. This involves 
delivering guest lectures on Carbon Capture and Hydrogen 
Technologies and engineering solutions, conducting company 
presentations to showcase the potential career paths at 
Technip Energies, and recognizing capabilities at an early 
stage through “Partnerships for Thesis” awards in Italy 
(33 theses in total from 15 universities). 
This approach has driven strong growth in the 2023 graduate 
intake, as we welcomed 455 graduates, 52% female and 
48% male, surpassing our targeted 50/50 ratio for the third 
year in a row. Also, our flagship Energy Transition Graduate 
Program officially kicked off in October, marking the start 
of  the  2-year development journey for 21 future Energy 
Transition leaders in 6 countries. Participants will receive 
an  accelerated development journey in which they are 
inducted into Technip Energies Energy Transition solutions 
(like our technologies) and wider organizational themes 
(Diversity, ESG and mentoring). 
Global talent acquisition resources management 
To align our global hiring practices, speed up the approval 
and reviewing process, and monitor and strategize our hiring 
practices, in 2023 we launched a Global Hiring Plan to 
capture the required and completed efforts for the year. All 
our entities have access to their overview and provide input 
on a regular basis allowing live tracking and monitoring of the 
system. Ultimately this enables a flexible and proactive 
approach to early resources management, locally and 
globally. Strategizing our approach through visibility and early 
preparation/engagement is key to ensuring a bias-free and 
ethical recruitment process, allowing the selection of true 
talent. 
Upskilling of our talent acquisition capabilities 
To enhance the capabilities of our Talent Acquisition (“ TA”) 
professionals, we have placed a strong emphasis on creating 
a knowledge-nurturing environment. In 2023, we conducted 
three online business learning sessions accessible to TA 
professionals from all seniorities. During these sessions, 
business representatives presented the (niche) career 
opportunities Technip Energies offers. All TA professionals 
were encouraged to obtain their official LinkedIn Certificate 
to testify to their LinkedIn proficiency, validating their 
proficiency and amplifying our ability to leverage our global 
Enterprise contract effectively.
Aligning our TA approach across Technip Energies, we 
updated our TA global standard in April, emphasizing the role 
of TA as an enabler for a diverse workforce. A specific TA 
onboarding process, blending local and global onboarding 
capabilities, ensures that all new joiners are seamlessly 
integrated into our global TA journey. 
Looking ahead to 2024, we are committed to further 
advancing our TA capabilities. We plan to dive deeper into 
equipping our TA professionals and hiring managers with the

Building skills for the future
Technip Energies University - Be Future Ready
As we drive the transformation of the energy industry 
together, cultivating a future-ready workforce becomes 
imperative. Recognizing our people as our primary asset, we 
launched T.EN University - an international learning center 
aimed at fostering a growth mindset. Built around six key 
domains - Technology, Project Management, Digital, 
Commercial, Management & Leadership, and Culture - with 
sustainability at its core, T.EN University aims to help 
individuals build, learn, evolve, and contribute to our shared 
purpose of breaking boundaries together to engineer a 
sustainable future. 
To support this, we have increased our global learning and 
development budget by 50%, and in our ESG roadmap, we 
have set a target of an average of 40 hours of learning per 
permanent employee annually by 2025. Progressively working 
towards this goal, we achieved 23 learning hours per 
employee in 2023, increasing 129% compared to 2022. 
Through My Development, our new mid-year development 
assessment, employees collaboratively build individual 
development plans with their managers.
Learning and development opportunities can be explored 
by  everyone in the T.EN University Prospectus, offering 
diverse options: in-person, online, virtual, team-based, or 
independent learning.
In 2023, our efforts focused on creating new learning and 
development offerings in Commercial Leadership and 
Management. Initiatives such as Commercial Skills for the 
Future, a 5-day boot camp delivered in Houston, Paris, Rome, 
and Kuala Lumpur, aim to instill new skills and mindsets. 
Additional programs cover our new Key Offers, Leadership 
Storytelling, and Advanced Development in Commercial Skills 
and Strategies, Negotiation Skills and Strategies, Contracts, 
and Claims Management. The establishment of a Commercial 
Community of Practice further strengthens collaboration 
within our global commercial team. 
In Leadership and Management, we have now introduced five 
development programs, from early management practice to 
C-suite preparation. Each brings the opportunity for face-to-
face interaction with peers across teams and locations,
creating a global management community of practice
enshrining our Values and Leadership Model. Management
programs include:
■ Team Working for Leads and Supervisors,  a two-day
program and toolbox to set teams up for success.
■ People Developer I, a 4-day program for new managers, to
focus on building skills in people management and
achieving results.
■ People Developer II,  a 4-day program for experienced
managers to deliver our strategy with effective change
management.
■ Catalyst, a highly selective program for 40 leaders of the
future to bloom in their career, to learn how to innovate
and connect.
■ Impact, a highly selective program for 20 senior leaders to
lead transformation.
Both Catalyst and Impact are delivered in partnership with 
INSEAD, one of the world’s leading business schools, to bring 
a blend of experiential and academic learning with best-in-
class faculty and coaches.
The Data Upskilling Program that we introduced in 2022 has 
been completed and we were pleased to launch a second 
cohort in 2023.
We continue to take care of our company commitments, 
bringing refreshed learning in Cybersecurity and Code of 
Business.
We have also been preparing the way for 2024 and the 
launch of our flagship Future Ready Program, a core learning 
pathway for all employees to support our business 
transformation. Topics will include Technip Energies Today & 
Tomorrow; Low-Carbon Technologies; Integrity @ the core; 
Inclusive Collaboration; The Road to Net Zero; Our Value 
Skills; Innovation Culture; Data Awareness Challenge; Well-
being; Introduction to Pulse, our safety leadership program; 
Introduction to Quartz, our quality leadership program; 
Environment and Human Rights.
We have also secured learning partnerships with technology 
education providers to develop a new offer in Technology 
learning from foundation to advanced levels. We will also 
introduce a Technology Leader program.
Further building our knowledge capital and connected expert 
networks will be at the heart of our developing strategy in 
2024.

Climate fresk and engagement
Technip Energies continues to deploy the Climate Fresk 
workshops initiated in 2022, to raise awareness about the 
climate change challenge.
In 2023, we trained 50 new facilitators and rolled out the 
workshops in Thailand, Italy, Qatar, UK, UAE and at Loading 
Systems in Sens, France, to 1,300 employees.
Climate Fresk 2023 workshops in Rome.
In 2024, building on the Climate Fresk momentum, we will

topics.
Elevating Potential: Reflecting on the 2023 
Talking Talents Campaign
Our “Talking Talents” are a unique forum of discussion for 
people development. Our mission with this Talking Talents 
campaign is to identify people with potential to grow in key 
positions and to provide everyone with the same opportunity 
for growth. The success of this campaign also relies on our 
capability to match business needs and people’s aspirations, 
being able to accelerate and think of different career paths 
when applicable. 
The 2023 Talking Talents campaign was the second edition of 
our new format. Last year, we initiated our new approach 
with clear definitions and criteria which have enabled us to 
all speak the same language on talent identification. 
With the intent to build upon these foundations, this year we 
went beyond people seniority and bet on people’s potential, 
even at early stages in their career. The major change for this 
year’s process was the digitalization through PeopleConnect, 
our global cloud Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platform. 
We are leveraging our efficiency by having digital processes 
and follow-up in a unique tool. 
This Talking Talents review is a year-long continuous 
exercise. We are convinced that following up your people’s 
aspirations and providing support in their development plan 
will make the difference. 
Growing expertise and technology capabilities 
At Technip Energies, Knowledge Management (KM) deploys 
solutions to help drive a culture of learning and execution 
through social learning, innovative collaboration, and 
knowledge transfer strategies, to unleash the potential of 
each employee and improve our core business capabilities. 
In  2023, we embedded our KM strategy within the larger 
Learning and Development strategy constructed to leverage 
synergies.
Boosting technology knowledge with Experts Explain 
At Technip Energies, we believe that learning can be an 
exciting and interactive experience. Produced by our 
dedicated Knowledge Management Team twice per month, 
for all employees Experts Explain  is an internal interactive 
global webinar that offers a variety of learning opportunities 
to all employees. The webinar is designed to provide 
employees with access to our experts and occasional 
external guest speakers who share their knowledge and 
expertise on various topics. Through Experts Explain 
webinars, employees can discover the latest information 
about company technology, market position, our portfolios, 
projects, and programs with employees who have real-world 
experience in their fields. This means that employees gain 
practical insights and tips that they can then apply to their 
work helping them upskill to better take on new challenges. 
The webinars are also an effective way to upskill and reskill 
employees on energy transition topics. In 2023, a total of 21 
global webinars were organized and attended by almost 
5,000 live attendees, not counting the numerous employees 
who watch the recordings and learn this way. In 2024, the 
roadmap of webinars will focus on Technology and 
Innovation topics as well as some of the Company’s key 
offers. 
Valuing our People and 
Promoting Technical Expertise 
Technip Energies is proud of its Technical Expertise Program, 
established to recognize outstanding expertise and reward 
technical experts while leveraging their expertise in Learning 
and Development upskilling initiatives such as Experts 
Explain.
In 2023, our Technical Expertise Program (“ TEP”) was 
strengthened with the recent addition of 139 new experts 
and the promotion of 17 existing members to a new level, out 
of 240 applications received. Our ambition is to shift from an 
EPC company with technologies to a technology company 
with engineering capabilities, as we emphasize technology 
more than ever and continue to expand into new areas. We 
onboarded new experts in energy transition disciplines such 
as biofuels, green hydrogen, ammonia, biochemical and bio-
plastics. The program demonstrates our commitment to 
support our technical talents and the value they bring, 
empowering them to provide technical leadership and share 
knowledge. We now benefit from the specialist know-how of 
509 members of the Technical Expertise Program. 
From Expertise Day to Technology Day 
Each year, we celebrate expertise through a worldwide 
event for all employees to engage and share knowledge. 
In 2023, this event was renamed Technology Day to reflect 
our focused and collaborative endeavor to become a 
technology company with engineering capabilities. This day 
was celebrated company-wide in 20 locations gathering 
5,800 attendees around a common theme: People and 
Technology Driving Energy Transition. As part of the event 
more than 140 technical presentations were given on key 
topics such as Biofuels & Biorefinery, Floating Offshore 
Wind, and Decarbonization. Thousands of learning hours 
were recorded during these events and Technology Day 
continues to be a great influence as we strive to grow as 
a learning organization. 
Nurturing a people developer environment 
and a change-ready mindset 
At Technip Energies, we understand that employees are our 
most valuable assets. We recognize and appreciate that each 
individual possesses unique talents and abilities. As such, our 
performance management journey is designed to foster a 
high-performing culture where every employee is supported

in their career aspirations and professional growth. Our 
performance management journey consists of an annual 
three-step Performance & Development process and has 
been enhanced, in times of tremendous change, to support 
each talent to be successful in their jobs in an inspiring 
framework.
Change-ready mindset and values as part 
of our development and performance journey 
The first step  of our process is the goal-setting campaign, 
which takes place at the beginning of the year. This step is 
critical in ensuring that our employees have clear objectives 
and a roadmap for achieving their goals for the upcoming 
year. 
The second step  is the mid-year development conversation 
with managers, which was implemented for all employees for 
the first time in 2023. It is an opportunity to explore career 
aspirations, review skills (technical and value skills), identify 
learning opportunities and design an individual development 
plan. More than half (51%) of Technip Energies’ employees 
now have an individual development plan aligned with their 
manager, demonstrating a strong commitment to continuous 
performance and development conversations. This second 
performance and development check-in supports our growth 
mindset and enables managers at Technip Energies to be the 
key driver of the professional growth and development 
process.
We support all employees in the way they translate our 
culture into action. In My Development, we introduced our 
Technip Energies’ value skills review to demonstrate values 
while developing the right skills and behaviors beyond the 
current role. Our Values allow us to express who we are and 
how we do business at Technip Energies. They remind us 
what we believe in; they reflect the DNA that unites us, and 
drive the way we can deliver on our Purpose. The 
introduction of our value skills review marks a significant 
step, aiming to empower every individual within our team to 
embody these values. This initiative not only fosters the 
acquisition of essential skills and behaviors beyond their 
current roles but also helps in recognizing and cultivating the 
right behaviors to build individualized development plans.
The third step  of our performance management journey is 
the performance review campaign. In 2022, 95.3% of Technip 
Energies employees successfully completed their assessment 
process as well as 98.4% of our Senior Managers. In 2023, we 
reviewed the performance framework to provide a more 
qualitative rating, moving from a 4-point to a 5-point rating 
scale. The performance model has also been enhanced to 
ensure that our managers are equipped to assess not only 
results but also the ways in which we achieve those results. 
This is achieved through a system based on three pillars that 
drives performance while staying true to our commitments 
and values and fostering a change-ready culture. Technip 
Energies has placed a greater emphasis on embracing 
‘change’ in the performance management and people 
initiatives to ensure we are supporting all employees to 
succeed and thrive in an ever-changing environment. We are 
encouraging everyone to develop a change-ready mindset to 
help adapt to the complexity and opportunity that change 
brings by introducing a dedicated pillar in the assessment 
process to this dimension.
The Performance Management and Development process is 
sequenced in individual self-assessment, recommended 
feedback collection, and managerial evaluation ensuring a 
fair and equal process for all. 
Our expertise has been a key marker of our company's 
performance over the past years. As part of our Technical 
Expertise Program and our Performance management 
process, the Experts Council at Technip Energies has defined 
objectives in five key areas (technical mastery, technical 
impact, people development, business impact, and industry 
leadership) for our more than 500 experts in the Company. 
This ensures that our experts are focused on the areas that 
are most critical to the organization and are able to make the 
required level of impact. 
This performance and development journey is an illustration 
of our ambition to build employees' professional growth and 
development at Technip Energies. We are committed to 
providing our employees with the necessary tools and 
resources to achieve their goals and reach their full potential. 
By investing in our employees, we are investing in the future 
success of our company.
Compensation and Benefits
Compensation policy: 
sustaining a competitive approach
The ambition of our compensation and benefits strategy is to 
be competitive in each market in which we operate, to 
motivate our employees to achieve and exceed short-term 
and long-term business and ESG objectives, to uphold 
Technip Energies’ Values and Purpose, and to align the 
interests of our employees with our shareholders. The 
Company's pay-for-performance philosophy is supported by 
a robust performance management process, which strives to 
set our employees' total remuneration package at a 
competitive level by benchmarking the market and providing 
incentives geared to agreed performance outcome, where 
appropriate. We aim to reward to our managers, and as many 
employees as possible, with short-term incentives driven by 
individual, team, and Group performance. We provide long-
term incentives to high-potential and highly valued 
employees, driven by the Company’s long-term performance 
and value creation. We believe our long-term success is 
directly linked to the caliber of the employees we employ 
and the working environment that we create. See also 
section  5.3.3. Employee share schemes of the 2023 Annual 
Report.
Success of our first worldwide employee 
shareholding operation (ESOP)
In 2023, Technip Energies announced the launch of ESOP 
2023, an employee share operation offered to around 12,000 
eligible employees in 19 countries, with the objective of 
sharing the long-term value creation of the Company with its 
employees.
The operation was based on two offers:
• “ESOP Classic”, where the subscriber benefits from a
discounted price and a matching contribution.
• “ESOP Leverage”, where the subscriber benefits from the
protection of the personal contribution, and the greater of
either (i) a guaranteed minimum return over the
investment period, or (ii) a multiple of the protected
average increase in the Technip Energies share price.
These two offers were proposed as part of Technip Energies' 
Group Savings Plan (PEG) and International Group Savings 
Plan (PEGI).
This first operation was a resounding success, with the 
volume of applications significantly exceeding the allocated 
envelope. More than 4,500 employees chose to subscribe to 
the ESOP 2023 offer, bringing the overall subscription rate 
to  33%. A total of 1,756,434 new shares were issued on 
September 19, 2023, as part of the capital increase, 
representing 0.98% of issued share capital, with total 
proceeds from the capital increase of €29,999,892.72.  The 
new shares were subscribed at a price of €17.08 per share, 
representing a 20% discount to the €21.34 reference price.

Setting core benefits standard worldwide
The creation of Technip Energies in 2021 was the occasion to 
define a new corporate culture with the goal of embedding 
ESG in everything we do and in the choices we make to 
reinforce our long-term impact. Accordingly and in relation to 
Technip Energies’ aspiration to offer an adequate work 
environment to its people, we set the objective to provide a 
new core benefits standard worldwide by 2025. The ambition 
of setting global core benefit standards is to provide Technip 
Energies’ employees with a harmonized level of benefits 
wherever they operate, embedding basic coverage needs as 
well as reflecting as much as possible on well-being 
expectations from today’s society. 
To achieve this high-level ambition, the first step of the 
journey involved clearly identifying our risk portfolio and 
mutualizing it as much as possible through multinational 
pooling. In 2022, we carried out an exhaustive inventory of all 
employee benefits throughout the Company with the 
objective of optimization, alignment, and harmonization. As 
part of this inventory, we benchmarked Technip Energies’ 
practices with other companies in the industry to reinforce 
our alignment with our peers where needed. 
These actions were finalized in 2023, with a particular focus 
on inventory and benchmarking. Since then, we focused our 
efforts on defining a draft design for the global core benefits 
program. This work was carried out iteratively in 
collaboration with Technip Energies’ People and Culture 
senior management and teams as well as with key external 
partners (global brokers, consultants). In 2024, we will 
validate the final design of the program and evaluate the 
various associated costs, before taking all the necessary 
steps with our global brokers and insurance companies. 
Our objective is to provide coverage for at least 90% of our 
employees under the new core benefits standard worldwide 
by 2025.
When comparing social security systems around the world, in 
India, France, the UK, or the USA for example, the way people 
are protected by their nation differs totally from one country 
to another. Therefore, we do not aim to provide everyone 
with the same terms, but we aim to agree on the key 
markers, on the principles and rights that we are defending. 
This may include flexible working, parental leave for men and 
women, minimum levels of coverage for death or access to 
healthcare as well as other non-insured benefits. In addition, 
flexibility will be given to Technip Energies’ entities to enrich 
the core offer to reflect their local market specificities. Once 
the design phase is completed, we will define the guidelines 
for our entities to converge towards this core benefits 
standard as their existing insurance contracts expire.
3.2.4. Diversity & Inclusion
In 2023, Technip Energies strengthened its commitment 
to  advancing Diversity and Inclusion (“ D&I”). Steering the 
organization towards impactful actions and strategies, the 
introduction of the D&I Champions Network marked a pivotal 
moment in cultivating this commitment. Our focus extended 
beyond gender, embracing meaningful diversity representation 
such as Disability, LGBTQ, Ethnicities, and Generations. The 
unwavering dedication of our employees propels us towards 
a future where diversity and inclusion are not just ideals but 
integral components of our corporate identity. We eagerly 
anticipate and value their continued contributions to our 
shared success. 
Governance and Leadership Commitment 
We established a robust governance structure, leading with 
intent, and formed a D&I Champions Network comprising 
leaders dedicated to fostering an inclusive environment. 
Under the executive sponsorship of Wei Cai, Chief Technology 
Officer, our 70+ D&I Champions meet on a quarterly basis 
with the aim of playing an active role in advocating, 
promoting, taking a stand and identifying barriers and 
solutions for a more inclusive culture to drive positive 
impact.
A new Diversity and Inclusion Policy
The Board has adopted a new Diversity and Inclusion Policy 
effective October 31, 2023, replacing the existing Diversity 
Policy. The policy aims to promote diversity in the 
composition of the Company's workforce and the Board, 
fostering an inclusive culture. It encompasses various 
aspects of diversity including sex and gender identity, age, 
ethnicity, nationality, occupational disabilities, sexual 
orientation, marital status, education, background, 
experiences, faith, and religion. The policy seeks to ensure 
diversity of views and expertise within the Board and senior 
management to better understand current affairs and long-
term risks and opportunities. Candidates for Board and 
senior management positions will be selected based on 
merit, with consideration given to diversity factors such as 
nationality, age, gender, and educational and professional 
backgrounds. The Company prioritizes increasing workforce 
diversity to align with stakeholders and markets, believing it 
will enhance business performance, decision-making 
processes, and Board functioning.

Progress in Workforce Gender Diversity 
and Leadership Representation
We closed 2022 with 29.7% representation of women in our 
permanent workforce. In 2023, through the implementation 
of our Inclusion in Action initiatives, particularly focused on 
our largest Operating Centers, we achieved significant 
progress, closing the year at 30.5%. Notably, this growth was 
particularly pronounced in France, India, the USA, and Italy.
In parallel, our efforts to elevate women into leadership 
positions saw tangible results. In 2022, women accounted for 
18.1% of leadership roles within band 15.1 and above in our 
grading system. By December 2023, this figure rose to 22%, 
positioning us well on our path towards our 2025 goal of 25% 
representation. This upward trajectory underscores our 
commitment to fostering diversity and gender equality 
throughout our organization.
Many Voices, One Team 
Demonstrating our commitment to fostering continuous, 
transparent communication with our employees, we engaged 
in the 'My Voice' engagement survey. Particularly noteworthy 
is the heightened satisfaction among employees regarding 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. 82% of our employees state 
that they can be their authentic self at work. Our focus is to 
maintain this positive trajectory and elevate it further. We 
aim to achieve this by implementing initiatives that actively 
address concerns, fostering an environment where 
employees feel empowered to be who they want to be 
without fear of judgment.
Global Initiatives for Inclusion
Recognizing the value that an inclusive and diverse workplace 
brings, we invited countries to thoughtfully craft   local 
engagement and D&I action plans aimed at addressing 
employee feedback from the “My Voice” survey. We 
implemented Inclusion in Action and Engagement plans 
across key countries, including France, India, Italy, the USA, 
United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, Spain, United Kingdom, the 
Netherlands, and Colombia. With over 70 initiatives, these 
plans cover crucial areas like career advancement, well-
being, and talent acquisition.
In our Spain operating center, a truly commendable initiative 
illuminated Disability Week in December, shining a spotlight 
on inclusivity through inspiring training sessions and 
workshops. Across the Atlantic in the U.S., we broadened our 
horizons by extending university recruiting efforts to 
historically underrepresented campuses, with the aim of 
embracing the rich diversity of talented youth. Meanwhile, in 
our Paris Center, we have dedicated ourselves to unlocking 
opportunities for women with the support of the EVOLEN 
Women in Engineering Committee and the Network of Major 
Companies acting in La Defense. Through an inclusive 
mentoring program open to both men and women, we are 
fostering an environment where shared industry knowledge 
empowers women to develop their talents and explore new 
career paths. These endeavors embody our commitment to 
creating pathways of growth and inclusivity. 
Focused Learning Initiatives
To reinforce our commitment, we are actively facilitating 
continuous learning for our leadership, commencing with the 
Executive Committee to heighten awareness of inclusion 
barriers in the workplace and foster visible accountability. 
Our dedication to continuous improvement extends to all 
employees, with a specific focus on managers. Embracing a 
hybrid approach, we will deliver in our T.EN University Future 
Ready Program targeted learning experiences through both 
in-person and online sessions, ensuring a dynamic and 
inclusive learning environment for ongoing development.
As part of this initiative, every employee will have the 
opportunity to enroll in a tailored series of Diversity and 
Inclusion (D&I) learning content. This curated content, 
developed in collaboration with our learning partner RW3 
Culture Wizard, is specifically designed to suit our 
organizational context. 
Reflecting on this collaborative commitment, RW3 Culture 
Wizard expresses enthusiasm, “We are excited to collaborate 
with Technip Energies in advancing diversity and inclusion 
learning. This partnership will empower employees to 
cultivate a workplace where every voice is valued, contributing 
to a culture of innovation, and belonging”.
Social dialogue
Technip Energies is committed to maintaining an ongoing, 
open and constructive dialogue with employees or their 
representatives to better support its transformation and 
share its strategy. In 2023, the negotiations launched to 
set  up a European Works Council came to a successful 
conclusion. The creation of a transnational employees’ 
representation body, in early 2024, will provide a greater 
channel for worker involvement and representation across 
European Member States on economic, financial and social 
transnational issues of strategic importance for the 
Company. This new step in the development of a 
constructive social dialogue also contributes to the 
construction of a common culture and the reinforcement of 
a feeling of belonging within Technip Energies.
In 2023, our workforce in Europe (France, Germany, Italy, 
Spain, etc.) is represented by unions or works councils, 
covering more than 40% of our global worldwide headcount.

3.2.5. Contribute to local development
For Technip Energies, we have a responsibility that goes 
beyond our day-to-day work to make a positive and lasting 
impact on our local communities. This is why contributing to 
local communities’ development is integral to our ESG 
Roadmap and Scorecard. Our initiatives fall into three main 
categories: 
■ Volunteering;
■ Local development engagement; and
■ The T.EN Relief and Development Fund (“TRDF”).
Volunteering hours: progress against target
Technip Energies’ initiatives: main themes in 2023
The total is higher than 100% because an initiative can be related 
to several themes.
Volunteering to build stronger communities 
We support employees who, on a voluntary basis, are willing 
to lend their time to support community development 
programs and initiatives. In 2023, 8,556 people were engaged 
in 231 local initiatives, dedicating 24,343 volunteering hours. 
These initiatives, which are organized by the local operating 
centers, benefited over 146,500 people in our local 
communities.
As an engineering company, the focus of volunteer support 
includes Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics 
(“STEM”) education, to motivate underprivileged students 
and girls to have equal opportunities and become future 
leaders in these fields. Below are some examples of our 
volunteering activities around the world.
Volunteerism and giving back
Company volunteer day at Houston Food Bank.
At Technip Energies in the USA , employee resource groups 
(“ERG”) bring together employees around shared goals to 
have a positive impact in the workplace and in the 
communities in which they operate. These groups are at the 
forefront of many volunteering initiatives:
■ ONE Group, the Organization of Networking Employees,
aims to promote a diverse and inclusive culture
supporting individual uniqueness to enhance the employee
experience. Volunteering events include a 5 km run
fundraising event in support of the American Heart
Association, collaboration with “Shoes that Fit” to provide
athletic shoes and school supplies to sponsored children
in local school districts, and the assembly of Welcome
Home Baskets for Pine Street Inn to help people moving
out of homelessness and into housing. Volunteers also
joined a tree planting event at the Houston Memorial Park
Conservancy, contributing to the park biodiversity by
planting 200 trees of nine different species.
■ Family Network provides support and social engagement
to families within Technip Energies and in our
communities. It aims to help employees balance home
and career, to support families during difficult times, and
connect families, to share, learn, and support those in
need in our communities. It organized events with the
Houston Food Bank, collecting over one thousand pounds
(lbs) of food donation for vulnerable communities, and
participated in Project Rescue Ocean to clean up the
bayou.
■ BOLD, the Black & Brown Organization for Leadership and
Development is a platform to promote recruitment,
development, and retention of black and brown
professionals through learning and talent enrichment
programs, community outreach and communication
channels. The BOLD network is particularly active in
organizing STEM events such as “Your Energy… Your
Future”, where over 40 employees spent a day with nine- 
and ten-year olds at the Hearne Elementary School to
spark excitement in STEM. The tutoring enrichment
program has helped underprivileged students improve
their math assessments by 1-2 grade levels.

In France , we support associations that help teenagers 
identify career opportunities. The foundation CGénial 
connects schools, universities and businesses to inspire 
students by providing concrete examples of careers in 
science, technology, and IT. We also support local 
communities in need through the donation of clothing and 
hygiene products and raise environmental awareness by 
deploying climate fresks, in particular among young women, 
to get inspired by engineering educational pathways.
One of the leading initiatives in Italy  was the sponsorship 
and participation to “Race for the Cure” event in Rome with a 
team of 300 colleagues, to collect funds for cancer research 
and prevention. Thanks to this donation, 3,000 free 
screenings were offered to women. T.EN Italy also supports 
Retake, an association actively engaged in the urban 
regeneration of Rome campaign to make the Ostia area 
cleaner. 40 volunteers joined a beach clearing event 
collecting over 250 kg of waste. 
In the UK,  volunteers joined with local businesses in Milton 
Keynes for the MK Can challenge to form the longest line of 
food cans in the world and break the world record! The 
challenge raised food, funds and awareness for the Milton 
Keynes food bank, which supports many families in need.
Preparing students in sustainability, 
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia
School Adoption Program STEM - Float your boat and Bucket 
tower with San Peng.
In Kuala Lumpur, the sustainability team and graduates work 
with 5 schools located in Kuala Lumpur and Bintulu, Sarawak 
to promote STEM activities. In recent  years , more than 
800  students have participated in the program, and we 
receive excellent feedback from the students and teachers.
A joint program by Technip Energies and AFES (Alam Flora 
Environment Solutions) was launched this year to integrate 
recycling education and practices into schools. By providing 
schools with support, resources, and recognition, the 
program aims to create a culture of sustainability and 
environmental responsibility among students, fostering a 
generation that understands and values the importance of 
recycling and waste management. Monthly waste collection 
from each school encourages students to participate in 
recycling activities and teaches them the monetary value of 
waste.
Fluorescent lighting from our offices that was nearing its end 
of life was donated to nearby schools to provide lighting. 
Once these florescent tubes reach their end of life, they will 
be safely collected and recycled to avoid any hazardous 
waste ending up in landfill.
Technip Energies Kuala Lumpur also organized volunteer days 
for employees to participate in tree planting events; 
500 mangrove saplings were planted during the Jungle Day at 
Kuala Senangor Nature Park, and employees from Technip 
Energies in Shanghai  planted 60 native holly trees at the 
Changxing Island Country Park.
In 2024, we will launch a global program to raise awareness, 
share success stories, and inspire others to join us. Together, 
we continue to create a positive impact.
Local development engagement, India
Our flagship program, ‘Seed of Hope’
We were honored to receive the “ Best CSR Project of the 
Year” award from the Indo-French Chamber of Commerce 
and Industry for our flagship program “Seed of Hope”. Since 
its launch in 2015, the program, which strives to ensure 
equilibrium between the social, environmental, and economic 
capital of our ecosystem, has positively benefited more than 
95,000 lives, through needs-based projects focusing on:
■ Ensuring environmental sustainability, circular economy 
and renewable energy;
■ Empowering communities, education support, community 
development, disaster relief;
■ Enabling women empowerment, Garima project, STEM 
Mini Science Centers and scholarships.
This project reiterates our belief in the fact that 
sustainability is at the center of everything we do.
Accelerating Circular Economy (ACE) project 
In Dahej, Gujarat, India , we have set up a recycling center to 
treat both biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste which 
is completely powered by solar power. The waste is 
collected, segregated and then recycled – biodegradable 
waste is recycled into organic manure, non-biodegradable 
waste, such as plastic, cardboard and so, is segregated, 
shredded and bundled to be sold on to recyclers. 
In contrast to the ‘Take-Make-Dispose’ linear economy, the 
ACE Project is based on the ‘Reduce-Reuse-Recycle’ Circular 
Economy phenomenon powered by clean energy leading to 
avoidance of carbon emissions and a desired low-carbon 
economy for our society. 
Here are a few of the positive socio-environmental impacts 
of the ACE project since its inception in 2021:
■ Recycled 130,000 kg of waste of which 18,000 kg are non-
biodegradable;
■ Generated 721 MWh energy from renewable sources from 
installed 80 solar street lights, biogas plants, solar panels 
in schools and waste recycling center;
■ Over 1,600  million tonnes of CO 2eq emissions avoided 
through clean energy and recycling initiatives;
■ Sustainable livelihoods income provided for waste 
collectors, 90% of whom are women;
■ Social and environment impact assessment carried out by 
third parties.

Garima project, empowering women
Garima project, empowering women in India.
At our manufacturing yard in Dahej, Gujarat, India, we provide 
vocational training for women to pursue different trades, 
such as sewing and stitching. In 2023, 36 women benefited 
from this project (40 in 2022), giving them access to a bank 
account and government insurance scheme, providing them 
with independence and empowerment. The women have 
produced over 45,000 eco-friendly cotton face masks and 
bags and generated income of more than ₹450,000 Indian 
rupees (around €5,000).
Scholarships for girls in STEM
Technip Energies India provides university scholarships to 100 
female engineers from underprivileged backgrounds in their 
first year of Engineering in Chemical, Civil, Electrical and 
Mechanical streams. This initiative is complemented by our 
employees who have volunteered their time to actively 
engage with aspiring female engineers during online 
interviews and share their insightful experiences of their 
journey with Technip Energies India.
Mini Science Center for Girls
T.EN India has established 3 STEM Mini Science Centers for
girl students in Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, and Gujarat thereby
benefiting more than 2,000 young students. These STEM Mini
Science Centers consist of 75 tabletop science-based working
models with 33 backdrops and manuals in regional language
providing hands-on experience for learning Science and
Mathematics in a playful manner for students of Class 5-10.
T.EN Relief and Development Fund
The T.EN Relief and Development Fund (“ TRDF”) is a 
corporate endowment fund to support social and charitable 
initiatives in countries where we have a permanent presence. 
The fund is coordinated by TRDF members who set the 
investment policy and select projects that address our 
sustainability priorities such as health, education, emergency 
missions, natural disaster relief and other topics related to 
our ESG Roadmap. Since its creation in 2011, the TRDF 
supports between five and ten NGOs per year for specific 
projects in different countries.
In 2023, the TRDF supported projects in Egypt, France, South 
Korea, Mozambique and Thailand, and helped communities 
facing natural disasters in Morocco, Libya, Syria and Turkey.
■ Egypt: Through ASMAE, we promote the protection of
vulnerable children and young people aged 6 to 17 in Cairo
by raising awareness and strengthening the capacities of
local actors and services involved in child protection.
■ France: For the third consecutive year, Technip Energies
invited the “Yalla! Tour for the Rights of the Child”
organized by ASMAE. This time our Cybernetix site in
Marseille welcomed employees and school children to
raise awareness of the International Convention on the
Rights of the Child to protect children’s well-being and
development through the respect of its principles. This
year focused on preventing harassment at school and
cyberbullying.
■ South Korea:  We donated to the charity Green Umbrella
Child Fund for the protection and education of children in
the Ulsan area. The objective is to support underprivileged
children by giving them educational and talent
development opportunities, especially through the “Green
Umbrella I-Leader” project. Thereby, we foster an
environment where children can grow into healthy social
people who can contribute their talents to society.
■ Mozambique: Since 2019, through ESSOR, we help the
social and professional inclusion of young people in the
Cabo Delgado province. In 2023, our support was
dedicated to the inhabitants of a district in the South of
Maputo after the flooding that happened in February. Also,
through INTERAIDE, we provide awareness and support
regarding health, sanitation, and disease prevention to
disadvantaged families in the South of Pemba; in 2023,
around 5,000 families benefited from improved health
services thanks to our contribution.
■ Thailand: The Yuvabadhana Foundation based in Bangkok
allows children to continue their education. Through the
Education Scholarship Program, we are financially
supporting 11 students over six years to complete their
high school education. In addition to the scholarship,
volunteers are providing an active mentoring and pen-pal
program.
■ Morocco and Libya:  Through the Red Cross, we provided
financial support for reconstruction following the
earthquake in Morocco and the flooding in Libya that
happened in September 2023.
■ Syria and Turkey: By donating to the Red Cross, we helped
the victims of the 7.8 magnitude earthquake that hit
Turkey and Syria in February  2023 to provide medical
supplies and rebuild houses.

Technip Energies’ Code of Business Conduct
Technip Energies’ aim of building a better tomorrow is 
intrinsically linked to the respect of our Values. Our Code of 
Business Conduct serves as a fundamental guide that must 
be read and followed by our Directors, officers, employees, 
and stakeholders. We aspire to develop business 
relationships with like-minded stakeholders, such as clients, 
subcontractors, suppliers, and business partners who are 
guided by a similar set of principles of business conduct.
Our Ethics & Compliance program is designed to prevent, 
detect, and remediate violations of our Code of Business 
Conduct whenever they arise. We are committed to 
continuously improving and enhancing our Ethics & 
Compliance program, through relevant risk assessments, data 
analysis, policies and procedures, and cooperation amongst 
key stakeholders.
Our Code of Business Conduct is available at www.ten.com/
en/about/integrity-compliance.
Governance
We do not compromise on integrity. Our Code of Business 
Conduct helps us recognize and address the ethical 
dimensions of our everyday decisions. The Ethics & 
Compliance organization is part of the Legal Department, 
under the responsibility of the Chief Legal Officer. The 
Company’s Chief Compliance Officer leads a dedicated team 
of legal and compliance professionals that provide support, 
advice and risk management services relating, in particular, 
to anti-bribery and corruption, internal investigations, trade 
sanctions, export controls, conflicts of interests, and data 
privacy. Dedicated subject matter experts and compliance 
counsels serving geographic roles and covering our projects 
ensure that the Ethics & Compliance program is implemented 
consistently across the different businesses and geographies 
of the organization. 
In 2023, we created a Business Conduct Committee (“ BCC”) 
consisting of nine (9) managers including the Chief 
Compliance Officer and the Chief People Officer  who are 
permanent members of the BCC. The BCC meets quarterly to 
discuss Ethics & Compliance-related matters to ensure 
operational activities are aligned with our Values.
The Chief Compliance Officer reports to the Chief Legal 
Officer and the Sustainability Committee of the Board of 
Directors. The Sustainability Committee monitors the 
development and implementation of our compliance program 
to ensure that the Company operates in compliance with the 
principles of ethical conduct and good governance. 
The Audit Committee reviews with the Chief Legal Officer 
and Chief Compliance Officer all material legal and 
compliance matters that may have a material impact on the 
Company’s financial statements.
Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery 
Compliance Controls
The Company is required to comply with numerous laws and 
regulations, in jurisdictions around the world where we 
conduct business, including countries perceived as having an 
increased risk of corruption. Moreover, Technip Energies is 
subject to French law No. 2016-1691 dated December 9, 2016 
(also more commonly known as “Sapin II”). 
Regardless of where we operate, Technip Energies does not 
accept any form of corruption and prohibits all acts of 
corruption (including bribes, facilitation payments, kickbacks, 
and self-dealing) and influence peddling. We do not make or 
accept improper payments to obtain or retain business with 
those in government or the private sector, or as a reward for 
awarding subcontractor or supplier contracts. We are 
committed to complying with all applicable international and 
national legislation against illegal payments, including 
prohibitions on facilitation payments (to expedite routine and 
administrative government action) except in extraordinary 
circumstances where the safety or security of an employee is 
in immediate danger.
Dedicated standards, policies, and procedures are designed 
to supplement the Code of Business Conduct by providing a 
clear and comprehensive operational framework. Such 
standards, policies, and procedures address in more detail 
the applicable bribery and corruption risks exposures, and 
include: 
■ an Anti-Bribery and Corruption Standard, which sets out 
our principles for strict compliance with applicable anti-
bribery and corruption laws;
■ a Third-Party Intermediaries and Business Partner 
Standard, which clarifies the requirements for the due 
diligence and monitoring of Third-Party Intermediaries and 
joint-venture/consortia partners. This Standard is 
designed to enable us to assess and manage bribery and 
corruption risks as part of our global business activities;
■ a Gifts, Hospitality, and Travel Standard, which sets forth 
our rules related to the receipt or provision of gifts, 
hospitality, or travel, and establishes procedures for the 
approval, reporting, and accounting of such. The Gifts, 
Hospitality, and Travel Standard assists employees in 
ensuring that gifts and hospitality, whether given or 
received as part of a usual courtesy of business, are not 
and cannot be considered as bribes;
■ a Social Donations, Sponsorships, and Charitable 
Contributions Standard which sets forth our rules related 
to the making of contributions to our communities to 
ensure contributions are not misused for improper 
purposes, such as to disguise illegal payments to 
government officials;
■ a Conflicts of Interests Standard, which sets forth our 
rules related to the identification and disclosure by 
employees of actual or potential conflicts of interest that 
could unduly influence the performance of their duties.
These standards are supplemented by internal operating 
procedures and guidelines. We have several processes to 
monitor compliance with our rules by employees and 
business partners, including by embedding compliance 
methods into the processes run by other functions. 
As set out in Technip Energies ESG Scorecard, the Company 
is committed to reducing non-mandatory commercial 
intermediaries, with the aim of eliminating all commercial 
agreements by December 31, 2025. The 2021 baseline 
comprises a list of 15 non-mandatory commercial 
intermediaries. At the end of 2023, agreements have been 
terminated with six of these commercial intermediaries, 
representing a 40% reduction since the start of the program.
Communication and awareness
Technip Energies uses a variety of tools to engage with 
employees, managers and third parties, such as face-to-face 
meetings, e-learning modules, dedicated intranet pages, 
articles, posters, targeted emails, short videos, messages on 
our “Yammer” internal social media network and dedicated 
introductions prior to every meeting.
Technip Energies has internally developed e-learnings 
covering various topics such as anti-bribery and corruption, 
trade compliance, and data privacy. 
In 2023, we launched a Company-wide in-person training 
campaign called Integrity @ the core and a refreshed version 
of the online training on our Code of Business Conduct.

Our culture of speaking up and no retaliation policy 
We encourage our employees to ask questions and report 
behaviors that may violate the guidelines set out in our Code 
of Business Conduct or in the policies and procedures that 
derive from it.
Various channels are available to report such concerns, and 
include anyone within the Company’s management, the Chief 
Compliance Officer or anyone within the Compliance 
organization, any officer of the Company, People & Culture 
representatives, or members of the legal department. 
Moreover, employees and third parties can report concerns 
using an independent third party via a dedicated reporting 
helpline (available at www.technipenergies.ethicspoint.com). 
The helpline allows users to submit questions or concerns 
securely and confidentially. 
Each report of a suspected violation of our Code of Business 
Conduct or its underlying standards is treated seriously, and 
investigated following the principles of objectivity, 
confidentiality, thoroughness, proportionality, timeliness, and 
professionalism. Investigators must follow internal Standards 
while conducting investigations to ensure that these are 
closed in a timely manner and in accordance with best 
practices. 
Technip Energies has a zero-tolerance policy on retaliation 
for good-faith reporting of suspected violations of our Code 
of Business Conduct or its underlying standards, or for 
assisting in investigations of suspected violations.
We encourage employees and others to raise questions and 
concerns to ensure that we are leading by example.
Trade Compliance
Technip Energies operates in a variety of jurisdictions having 
specific Export Controls and Trade Sanctions Regulations, 
including: export controls and trade and economic sanctions 
laws and regulations administered by the United Nations, the 
European Union and, as applicable, the United States 
Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security, 
the United States Department of the Treasury's Office of 
Foreign Assets Control, the United States Department of 
State and other governmental bodies having jurisdictions 
over the operations. These statutes may prohibit or restrict 
our ability to conduct activities directly or indirectly in 
countries or territories or with persons that are the target of 
trade sanctions-related prohibitions and restrictions. 
To ensure compliance with these laws, the Ethics & 
Compliance program monitors regulatory changes and takes 
all prudent steps to notify stakeholders and implement 
timely remedial actions.
Other compliance requirements 
At the outset of a business engagement, Technip Energies 
seeks to understand regulatory and compliance requirements, 
related to procurement, supply, and construction, whether of a 
national or supranational nature (e.g., European regulations). 
Based on this information, we develop a plan to ensure 
implementation of effective regulatory compliance management 
processes and to ensure delivery of work in compliance with 
applicable statutory requirements. 
Our operations and construction activities are governed by a 
variety of international, regional, transnational, and national 
laws and regulations relating to matters such as data privacy, 
human rights, environmental protection, health and safety, 
labor and employment, currency exchange, professional and 
operational licensing, and taxation. These laws and 
regulations are complex, frequently change, and have 
become increasingly stringent over time. In the event the 
scope of these laws and regulations expands in the future, 
the incremental impact of compliance could adversely affect 
Technip Energies’ financial condition, results of operations, or 
cash flows.
Technip Energies has implemented internal controls designed 
to minimize and detect potential violations of laws and 
regulations in a timely manner, but it can provide no 
assurance that such policies and procedures will be followed 
at all times or will effectively detect and prevent violations 
of the applicable laws by one or more of its employees, 
consultants, agents, or partners.
3.3.2. Sustainable supply chain
We collaborate with partners to assess and manage risks, 
and to implement solutions, to make our supply chain more 
sustainable. A more sustainable supply chain strives to 
reduce and minimize external environmental and social costs 
that are often beyond current commercial practices. The aim 
is to encourage more responsible behavior in our supply 
chain, in line with our ESG Scorecard.
Supplier & Subcontractor Integrity Expectations
Technip Energies expects its suppliers and subcontractors to 
follow the laws of each country they work in and the 
principles of the Technip Energies Code of Business Conduct. 
The Technip Energies Supplier & Subcontractor Integrity 
Expectations policy outlines the standards of ethical 
conduct, compliance, and respect for the environment, 
security and safety, human rights, privacy compliance, and 
protection of confidential information that suppliers and 
subcontractors must adhere to in order to do business with 
Technip Energies.
Sustainable procurement
Effective supply chain management is a major contributor to 
Technip Energies’ success in project execution (see also 
section the 2023 Annual Report 2.2.2.4. Procurement and 
supply chain). At Global Sourcing & Procurement (“ GSP”), we 
work with our suppliers to instill the culture of ESG and 
achieve the targets of our ESG roadmap. Building on the 
foundations laid in 2022, significant progress has been made 
in 2023 with ESG initiatives in our supply chain:
■ Supplier Qualification integrates ESG criteria: Moving
beyond the conventional supplier qualification parameters,
the process was revised and implemented at the start of
2023, to include ESG criteria such as GHG assessments
and human rights management.
■ Key suppliers monitored on ESG performance:
Methodology and associated guidelines have been
developed in 2023 for the selection of key suppliers based
on quantitative and qualitative criteria, allowing us to start
the monitoring and evaluation phase in 2024.
■ ESG Suppliers’ Council: In 2023, we launched the council
as an initiative that gathers together our suppliers to
jointly address ESG challenges, aiming to build a more
sustainable, responsible, and resilient supply chain.
As a key support function at the heart of our business, GSP 
has a role that is evolving, from one of building resilience to 
one of anticipation. A Future Supply Base department has 
been created to work closely with business lines to 
understand the dynamics and anticipate market trends for 
products that will be needed in the future, notably 
associated with the energy transition.

ESG Criteria in our suppliers’ qualification
Including ESG criteria in our suppliers’ qualification process 
is a way to ensure that our business is working with partners 
that share our sustainability values and ambitions.
Based on impacts, risks and opportunities, we defined and 
incorporated the following ESG aspects into our supplier 
qualification process: 
■ Business ethics; 
■ Environmental considerations, including carbon footprint, 
water and waste management, etc.;
■ Diversity; and
■ Labor standards and human rights management.
Based on the collected data and the associated analysis, we 
will be able to identify areas of focus and collaborate with 
our suppliers for any required enhancements.
Onboarding our supply chain in the ESG journey
November 2023 marked a key milestone with the successful 
inauguration of our first ESG Supplier Council with 20 major 
suppliers across the globe. 
Organized by our Global Sourcing & Procurement team, the 
event was in line with our ESG ambitions and aimed to build 
a more sustainable, responsible, and resilient supply chain. 
Through panel discussions and working sessions, participants 
exchanged best practices and identified opportunities for 
acceleration and continuous improvement of the 
sustainability path together, especially on topics like green 
manufacturing, green transport & logistics and supply chain 
human rights management.
Our CEO, Arnaud Pieton, opened the event by highlighting the 
importance of embedding our ESG roadmap at all levels of 
our business strategy, and how members of our supply chain 
can make a great difference.
David Tadbir, VP GSP, emphasized that building a sustainable 
supply chain together means incorporating ESG criteria into 
supplier qualification and selection, to make informed 
decisions that promote gender diversity and responsible 
travel, as well as integrating alternative technologies to 
reduce our environmental footprint. Technip Energies can 
only accomplish this by partnering and collaborating closely 
with our supply chain.
ESG Supply Council held in November 2023.
Building a sustainable subcontracting chain
At Global Construction, we partner with our subcontractors 
in charge of the execution of the works on construction sites 
for our EPC projects, aiming at building a responsible and 
sustainable global subcontracting chain.
Three ESG targets have been set up to achieve this ambition:
■ Integrate Technip Energies ESG criteria into our 
prequalification process to ensure that we select and 
qualify for projects subcontractors that match our ESG 
requirements and vision. In 2021, we began the 
development of a new prequalification application 
(“QualifyMe” app), integrating all the new defined ESG 
criteria in the main digital questionnaire, and generating 
automated ESG reports and scoring, to support the 
decision-making at an early stage (bidder list 
constitution). The development was completed at the end 
of 2022 and full-scale deployment (go live) was completed 
in 2023.
■ Monitor and audit in the field our subcontractors’ ESG 
performance. In 2024, we will define and set up a specific 
work process that will help us define and monitor our ESG 
KPIs, as well as audit our subcontractors at the job site 
throughout the project execution lifespan. We will also 
implement and deploy our new work process progressively, 
following a clear plan and timeline, and reporting on our 
progress and results regularly.
■ Establish an ESG subcontractors’ council to continuously 
improve subcontractors’ ESG performance. The aim of this 
council is to become the think tank for our ESG innovation 
and implementation, working to benefit the complete 
subcontractor chain and enhance overall ESG 
performance. The focus will be articulated around three 
main pillars: collecting feedback, sharing best practice and 
innovation, and standardizing best practice. We plan to 
launch the ESG subcontractors’ council in 2024.
3.3.3. Human rights due diligence program
At Technip Energies, we believe that protecting human rights 
is essential for creating a sustainable supply chain and it is a 
core value for our company. We are committed to 
implementing standards and processes that identify, prevent, 
and address Human Rights risks. Given the complexities of 
global supply chains, we understand the importance of 
collaborating with all stakeholders involved in the sector.
Our Code of Business Conduct reflects our commitment to 
ethical and lawful behavior and recognizes human rights as a 
fundamental principle. We do not tolerate any form of 
modern slavery, child labor, forced labor, indentured or 
involuntary labor, regardless of where we conduct business. 
We share and discuss our Code of Business Conduct with our 
clients, suppliers, and business partners to reinforce our 
culture of accountability. We strive to develop business 
relationships with like-minded subcontractors, suppliers, and 
business partners who share our principles of business 
conduct and aspire to only do business with counterparties 
who respect human rights and uphold labor laws.
The Company endeavors to ensure compliance with human 
rights within the scope of its operations and in accordance 
with the following international human rights regulations and 
principles: 
■ The United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and 
Human Rights; 
■ The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights; and 
■ The International Labor Organization’s Fundamental 
Conventions.
Human rights principles at Technip Energies encompass a 
broad range of topics, including prohibiting any form of child 
labor, forced labor and modern slavery; prohibiting 
discrimination in all forms; creating a working environment 
free from any form of harassment or violence; ensuring fair 
working conditions; maintaining a safe, healthy and secure 
workplace; ensuring ethical recruitment; respecting freedom 
of association and collective bargaining and grievance 
mechanisms. The protection of human rights principles 
involves many aspects of our operations. This topic is 
handled by different functions and departments working 
together to develop and implement effective processes to 
foster a better working environment for our employees and 
our subcontractors. We use the steps of the  OECD Due 
Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business  as our 
structural governance framework.

Technip Energies Human Rights Due Diligence Program overview
Embed responsible business conduct into 
policies and management systems
We have defined our overall policy by engaging with external 
and internal stakeholders to embed respect for human rights 
in our operations and business relationships and promote the 
protection of human rights for our employees in the 
workplace and across our supply chain as a foundational 
business practice. We recently issued our Human Rights 
Policy signed by the CEO, including the principles of our 
internal Human Rights Standard, and describing our due 
diligence program to ensure our operations comply with 
recognized human rights and worker welfare principles. 
An e-learning Module on Human Rights is now available to 
raise awareness among our employees on the topic. The 
training shall be proposed to a project teams working on EPC 
projects mapped as eligible for human rights mitigation.
Identify and assess adverse impacts in operations
We adopt a risk-based approach to identify and map human 
rights risks within our operations, implementing effective 
mitigation measures. During the tendering phase, we utilize a 
dedicated Human Rights Risk Mapping Tool. This tool allows 
us to proactively capture potential risks early in the process, 
enabling us to address them appropriately throughout project 
execution.
Subcontractors and suppliers are subject to human rights 
pre-qualification process to identify current and potential 
risks and understand the level of maturity on human rights 
topics. Suppliers and subcontractors are involved during the 
tendering phase of a project and before the signature of a 
contract. In addition, we are developing processes to 
evaluate the implementation of human rights and worker 
welfare requirements by our subcontractors during the 
execution of the work. A set of human rights KPIs aimed at 
monitoring the human rights performance of subcontractors 
during operations has been developed and integrated into 
contractual requirements. Also, we continue to assess how 
our company-wide monitoring processes can be reinforced in 
this area.
In 2023, we initiated field assessments focused on human 
rights for selected suppliers, following a risk-based approach. 
Additionally, we conducted a capacity-building phase, 
equipping them with tools and sharing best practices to drive 
improvement. Simultaneously, ongoing efforts are underway 
to conduct comprehensive human rights assessments across 
established and new procurement partners. This proactive 
approach aims not only to outline expectations but also to 
elevate the standards of human rights due diligence within 
the industry. 
In 2023, as part of this proactive approach, a ESG Supplier 
Council (see section 3.3.2. Sustainable supply chain) 
convened in Paris, marking a pivotal moment for our 
Company and suppliers’ commitment to environmental, 
social, and governance. This full-day event brought together 
20 key suppliers, deepening the collective commitment to 
and experience of sustainability and ethical practices. The 
Council's agenda comprised three distinct breakout sessions, 
with two sessions devoted to fostering sustainable energy 
practices and one specifically addressing human rights. The 
latter delved into the identification of key human rights risks 
within logistics and manufacturing, while emphasizing the 
importance of human rights due diligence, as well as sharing 
challenges and opportunities when developing and/or 
implementing due diligence.
Recognizing stakeholder engagement as a cornerstone, this 
event provided the opportunity to engage with suppliers 
while adding to a human rights-based approach in the just 
transition. Moreover, as part of our ESG Scorecard, we have 
achieved 40% of our KPI related to Human Rights Due 
Diligence and mitigation plan on eligible projects. This 
milestone underscores the Company's dedication to 
mitigating risks and fostering a culture of ethical 
responsibility within its operations. These endeavors 
collectively signify a concerted effort within the industry 
towards heightened awareness, engagement, and tangible 
action concerning human rights due diligence.
Cease, prevent and mitigate
To mitigate the risks of our EPC projects, our Sustainability 
Human Rights Team has collaborated with the Project 
Management of ten EPC projects in countries such as Egypt, 
India, Qatar, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and UAE in 2023. They 
have assessed the workers’ welfare conditions at our 
construction sites and identified areas for improvement, such 
as in the accommodation conditions in the camps, grievance 
mechanisms in all projects, social well-fare awareness 
sessions, and creating new communication channel as the 
social toolboxes to get direct feedback from the workers on 
their working and living conditions. They have also engaged 
the main construction subcontractors in a Stakeholder 
Engagement Program to communicate our expectations on 
social issues and encourage best practices in the industry.

In order to understand the site work environment, an 
additional channel to hear from the site workforce has been 
created, with the launch of an online survey with a QR code. 
The survey will be available in the languages of the workers, 
with the scope to assess the sentiment of the site, identify 
areas of improvement and intervene to build an action plan 
as appropriate.
In 2023, 40% of these EPC projects have human rights 
mitigation plans in place. This exercise will continue in 2024 
to ensure that by 2025, all eligible projects have mitigation 
plans in place.
2023 Human rights mitigation actions 
Collaboration 
We believe that collaboration is essential to addressing 
human rights risks in the supply chain. This is why we 
endeavor to discuss and align with all stakeholders from the 
earliest phase of tendering. As members of the United 
Nations Global Compact and part of the Steering Committee 
of Building Responsibly, an association of leading engineering 
and construction companies that work together to promote 
and raise the bar on human rights and worker welfare across 
the sector, we are closely involved in the definition of 
standards and development of tools associated with the 
Building Responsibly Worker Welfare Principles to support 
the industry supply chain. 
By speaking with the same voice and establishing agreed 
standards to prohibit any form of forced labor, 
discrimination, and harassment, while promoting ethical 
recruitment practices, and a safe working environment, we 
can have greater influence with our stakeholders.

Social Accountability – SA8000 Re-Certification
Technip Energies Italy has been re-certified with the SA8000 
Standard up to June  2025. The Standard certification 
manifests the commitment of Technip Energies in protecting 
human rights in the workplace and along the supply chain. 
The SA8000 Standard is the leading social certification, 
based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
International Labor Organization (“ ILO”) conventions. Since 
2011, Technip Energies Italy has been audited on a 
periodically basis by an external and independent third party 
approved by Social Accountability International (“ SAI”). The 
external independent third-party auditor, Bureau Veritas, 
assigned to the T.EN Italy Social management system a high 
level of maturity in terms of structure and control on social 
topics along the supply chain, and considered the social 
model in place in EPC Projects as a “best practice innovative 
approach”, in particular with respect to the “social 
toolboxes” created on construction sites to hear from 
workers.
Focus on SA8000: Cooperation with our client 
NESTE - RDCG Neste Project – Rotterdam
Technip Energies Italy - Europe social team.
Thanks to its SA8000 certification, Technip Energies Italy 
has been assigned by our client NESTE, to perform 
a Sustainability Program as part of the project scope 
of work, to ensure workers’ welfare during the RDCG 
Rotterdam Project. The program involves elements such 
as grievance mechanisms, social toolboxes to facilitate 
workers’ feedback, a stakeholders’ engagement program 
with the construction contractors, supply chain 
monitoring, and a Diversity and Inclusion project action 
plan.
The program is a best practice exercise thanks to the 
strong cooperation between NESTE and Technip Energies 
on social topics.
Focus: A continuous learning process – 
Assiut Hydrocraking Complex Project
Technip Energies Italy - MENA Social Team.
■ Contract: EPC LSTK contract for Hydrocracking
Complex
■ Client: Assiut National Oil Processing Company
(ANOPC)
■ Location: Assiut, Upper Egypt
■ Description: Construction phase started January 2022
for completion in 2025:
• 5,000 workers on site, 8,000 at peak construction
• 45% local workers (versus 30% target)
• Grievance mechanism
• 2 social rooms: since the site is far from leisure
facilities, we installed rooms dedicated to social
interaction between colleagues.
The construction phase of the Assiut Hydrocracking 
Complex Project began in early 2022 and is managed 
by our Rome operating center. 
Since the project is in the desert, the first challenge was 
to recruit and house over 3,000 workers at the site. We 
were able to recruit 45% of subcontracted workers from 
the local area, ahead of our 30% target. From the very 
beginning of the project, workers were informed about 
their rights and duties, and a clear grievance mechanism 
was established to allow workers to bring any issues to 
the attention of management and to be treated 
anonymously, fairly, and with respect. 
This mechanism provided us with a real insight into 
what is happening on site. During the first year 
of construction, we received over 400 grievances, 
which demonstrates that workers trust the system 
and are confident that it works. The main issues 
concerned terms of contract, welfare facilities, 
behavior, and wages. 
Thanks to our grievance mechanism and code 
of conduct, and with the correct information, we were 
then able to speak to subcontractors to resolve issues 
and improve relations without apportioning blame.

SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE
TECHNIP ENERGIES 83
I would like to thank Technip Energies’ Social team 
for the commitment and an open mindset related 
to human rights and requirements within the project. 
With a few key practices in place, we have been able 
to observe the situation and also make things right. 
We have set up daily monitoring of working 
conditions at the construction site. Our Social 
Toolbox helps us chat with workers from different 
companies, and the grievance mechanism “WE Care 
channel” is for workers to speak up if something's 
not right. Cases might be tricky sometimes, and we 
have been able to follow them through with your 
hard work. I'm happy to have this strong cooperation 
with Technip Energies, to make this construction 
site safe and fair for all of us.”

4. IMPACT BOOK
In line with our ESG Roadmap, we are committed to 
strengthening our ESG accountability and report on progress. 
In addition to the results presented below, this chapter is 
aligned with GRI Standards and covered by a limited 
assurance report.
Investors and other stakeholders are looking beyond 
traditional metrics to consider profitability that is sustainable 
over the long-term. Being able to demonstrate progress on 
ESG measures is an important differentiator and source of 
pride.
In 2023, we strengthened our report to include more 
indicators and dimensions in line with the GRI standards. 
This was only possible thanks to the new monitoring 
platforms put in place, such as the carbon web applications 
and the HSE data management system, Intelex. However, for 
the majority of them, it is not possible to calculate the 
figures with the same level of granularity for the previous 
years.
4.1. ESG INDICATORS
An independent practitioner performed a review of the 
sustainability report included in Chapter 3 of the Annual 
Financial Report for the year ended December 31, 2023. The 
independent practitioner issued a limited assurance report. 
Key performance indicators (KPIs) identified in the tables 
with an asterisk (*) have been reviewed with more level of 
depth in the assurance procedures.
The sustainability report encompasses the same entities as 
the consolidated financial statement, which can be found in 
2023 Annual Report Note 31. Companies included in the 
scope of the consolidated financial statements. Exceptions 
or further information on the reported ESG indicators are 
provided in section 4.2. Definitions and methodologies, as 
well as notes on tables in sections 4.1.1. Environmental 
indicators, 4.1.2. Social indicators, and 4.1.3. Governance 
indicators.

(*) An independent practitioner performed a review of the sustainability report included in Chapter 3 of the Annual Financial Report for the year ended 
December 31, 2023. The independent practitioner issued a limited assurance report available in the 2023 Annual report section 3.4.5 Limited 
Assurance Report of the Independent Auditor. KPIs identified in the tables with an asterisk (*) have been reviewed in more depth in the assurance 
procedures.
(1) For GHG emissions (scopes 1, 2 and 3 and avoided emissions) as well the energy consumption within Technip Energies, we have reviewed the figures
for the 2022 and 2021 financial years. This review was conducted due to the change of the perimeter of consolidation to fit the the Company’s
consolidated financial statements and the shift from equity shared to operation approach.
(2) During the annual review, an error was identified in the 2022 report related to total energy consumption on construction sites and yards. The
reported figure has been corrected accordingly. The company remains committed to enhancing data quality and continues to work towards
improvement.
(3) Significant incident: hazardous substance or critical natural resources involved, quantities at stake potentially above 100 liters, sensitive surrounding
biodiversity, and the recovery/rehabilitation measures require external assistance.
(4) Minor incident: hazardous substance or critical natural resources involved, quantities spilled minimal in relation to the site's activities, no sensitive
surrounding biodiversity, and recovery/rehabilitation measures can be managed by worksite.
(5) Negligible incident: no hazardous substance or critical natural resources involved, quantities spilled minimal in relation to the site's activities, no
sensitive surrounding biodiversity, and recovery/rehabilitation measures can be managed by worksite.
(6) Scope of air emissions reporting includes projects sites located in Bahrain, Qatar, India, and offshore.
(7) Our office in Perth, Australia is located around 2.6 km from the Kings Park, classified in the IUCN category I.

4.2. DEFINITIONS AND METHODOLOGIES
ESG Scorecard definitions
Our ESG scorecard is both a framework and a commitment. It is the way we translate our ambitions into specific objectives 
and targets. In the table below, we describe the main terminologies used in the ESG scorecard and how we calculate the 
respective targets.
CLIMATE & ENVIRONMENT
1. Reduce scope 1 & 2 emissions
compared to 2021
-30% by 2025 Reduction in percentage of the total GHG emissions scope 1 and scope 2 as
per the GHG protocol (market-based) compared with the baseline year of 
2021. The detailed methodology of scope 1 & 2 calculation is described in 
this section under the paragraph Carbon Footprint Methodology.
Net zero by 
2030
We will reach a state of net zero emissions by (a) reducing our scope 1 and 
2 emissions to a residual level that is consistent with reaching net zero 
emissions at the global or sector level in eligible 1.5°C scenarios; and (b) 
neutralizing any residual emissions at the net zero target date and any GHG 
emissions released into the atmosphere thereafter.
2. Report full scope 3
emissions
Completed by 
2030
Percentage of GHG emissions scope 3 categories as per the GHG protocol 
reported in the reporting year out of the 15 GHG Protocol categories of 
scope 3 emissions.
Net zero by 
2050
We will reach a state of net zero emissions by (a) reducing our scope 1, 2 
and 3 emissions to a residual level that is consistent with reaching net zero 
emissions at the global or sector level in eligible 1.5°C scenarios; and (b) 
neutralizing any residual emissions at the net zero target date and any GHG 
emissions released into the atmosphere thereafter. 
3. Avoid GHG Emissions to our
clients
 -15 MtCO2eq by
2025
Avoided GHG emission refer to GHG emissions reductions that occur 
outside of Technip Energies scopes 1, 2 & 3, but as a result of the use of the 
service sold or the project in the reporting year. Avoided GHG emissions are 
built on societal context, from the point of view of the one of the solutions, 
comparing two situations: with the solutions sold by Technip Energies, and 
without the solutions sold by Technip Energies (corresponding to the 
reference scenario or baseline).
4. Technology and Innovation
R&D efforts dedicated to
sustainability
100% by 2025 Technology and Innovation Research and Development (R&D) investment

and  relevant processes, sustainable fuels & chemicals, circularity, 
decarbonization solutions, from January 1 to December 31 of the reporting 
year.
5. Reuse water 50% by 2025 Percentage of water withdrawal, from Technip Energies’ own operation 
(offices and industrial sites) and value chain (construction sites and yards), 
whose source type is rainwater collected and stored for use, wastewater 
treated and reused internally, and/or wastewater from another organization 
in the reporting year. 
6. Recycle waste 85% by 2025 Percentage of waste diverted from disposal from waste generated at 
Technip Energies own sites and construction sites and yards in our value 
chain (where Technip Energies is HSE accountable) in the reporting year.

positions
25% by 2025 Percentage of permanent women employees in positions classified as band 
15 or above (internal job classification).
10. Zero fatalities Zero yearly No fatalities among our own workforce (employees and non-employees) nor 
our value chain's workers (subcontractors in projects sites for which 
Technip Energies is HSE accountable).
11. Total Recordable Incidents
Rate (“TRIR”) per 200,000
hours worked
<0.10 yearly Total number of recordable cases of work-related injuries and work-related 
illness per 200,000 hours of work.

Ambition Target Definition
ESG Scorecard 2023 restatement
In 2023, we made some adjustments in our ESG Scorecard in 
order to anticipate the recommendations of the European 
Sustainability Reporting Standards (“ ESRS”), to follow the 
recommendations of the GRI standards and to improve the 
understanding of our ambitions. 
■ Ambition 1:  Scope  1 & 2 reporting method was changed
from a location-based to a market-based approach. The
year of reference has been changed to 2021 when Technip
Energies was formed. The previous baseline year of 2019
corresponded to 20,460 tCO 2e of total scope 1 & 2, while
the new baseline represents 20,436 tCO 2e. The change in
the method also results in a variation of percentage of
GHG emissions reduction in 2022 from 11% (location-
based reduction from 2019) to 22.5% (market-based
reduction compared to 2021).
■ Ambition 3: Avoid GHG Emissions to our clients. The text
was reviewed from “Develop solutions for our clients to
avoid emissions” to improve clarity regarding this
ambition. The definition of the term “Avoided GHG
emissions” is detailed in this section of the report.
■ Ambition  4: Technology and Innovation R&D efforts
dedicated to sustainability. The text of this ambition was
reviewed to ensure consistency with its definition. For the
purpose of this ambition, only the R&D investments that
are managed by Technology & Innovation organization are
considered. It excludes the R&D investments related to
other functions or initiatives.
■ Ambition 5:  Reuse water. Text reviewed from “Water
consumed on sites from reused sources” for abridgment
purpose.
■ Ambition 6: Recycle waste. Review of the ambition to align
with the ESRS definition of diverted waste.
■ Ambition 17: Key suppliers and subcontractors monitored
on ESG performance. The word “audited” was removed
from the text. Under Technip Energies internal
procedures, the audit will be conducted on a case-by-
case basis in response to labor standard questions that
could trigger further review.
■ Ambition 18: Human Rights Due Diligence program on new
projects identified at risk and mitigation plans on on-going
projects identified at risk. Review of the text to clarify
that for projects under execution, where a full human
rights due diligence program was too late to implement,
we put a mitigation plan in place in order to minimize the
risks to human rights.
Technip Energies has also adopted a new ambition - 
Biodiversity: No projects performed in IUCN category I and II 
locations - reinforcing our commitment to the preservation 
of biodiversity.

Data restatement
For GHG emissions (scopes 1, 2 and 3 and avoided 
emissions), as well as for the energy consumption within 
Technip Energies, we have reviewed the figures for financial 
years 2022 and 2021. This review was conducted to align the 
sustainability reporting perimeter of consolidation with the 
Company’s consolidated financial statements and to shift 
GHG accounting from an equity-shared approach to an 
operational control approach. 
■ Total scopes 1 & 2 (location-based): -1.4% for 2022 and
+3.8% for 2021 of variation related to the figure reported
in the previous year.
■ Total  energy consumption within Technip Energies: +4.5%
for 2022 and +10% for 2021 of variation related to the
figure reported in the previous year.
■ Total scope 3 upstream: +2.3% for 2022 and +17% for 2021
of variation related to the figure reported in the previous
year.
■ Avoided emissions: +2.2% for 2022 of variation related to
the figure reported in the previous year.
During the annual review, an error was identified in the 2022 
report related to total energy consumption on construction 
sites and yards. The reported figure has been corrected from 
2,259,685 MWh to 1,140,340 MWh that represents a variation 
of -98% related to the figure reported in the previous year. 
The company remains committed to enhancing data quality 
and continues to work towards improvement.
Carbon Footprint Methodology
At Technip Energies, we engage with our various stakeholders 
to find and develop solutions to assess and reduce our global 
carbon footprint, including all direct and indirect greenhouse 
gas (“GHG”) emissions – whether scope 1, 2 or 3, as defined 
in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol).
In 2022, with the mobilization of a fully dedicated Climate 
Change and Actions team, we have developed our set of 
methodologies and calculation guidelines for scopes 1, 2 and 
3, aligned with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and ISO 
standards requirements. Our approach has been reviewed 
and confirmed with the support of well-recognized third 
parties in order to ensure a transparent and consistent 
approach, sound follow-up and tracking of our reduction 
objectives. We have then been able to expand our reporting 
to cover our entire scope  3 for both upstream and 
downstream emissions, and our scope of avoided emissions. 
In 2023, we have adapted our principle of consolidation of 
GHG emissions, in particular the reporting boundaries and 
the types of contracts to be considered, with the same 
perimeter as the Company’s consolidated financial 
statements. 
Reporting boundaries
In 2022, Technip Energies’ GHG emissions related to all 
scopes were consolidated and reported as per the equity 
share approach.
In 2023, the perimeter of reporting of these standards shall 
be the same as the perimeter of the Company’s consolidated 
financial statements. Technip Energies is disclosing the GHG 
emissions as per the GHG protocol, with the operational 
control approach, as follow:
■ 100% of scope  1, 2 & 3 emissions for fully consolidated
entities.
■ Percentage of consolidation/interests applied on scope 1,
2 & 3 emissions for joint arrangements (proportionally
consolidated).
■ Reported as scope 3 emissions: scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions
of net equity-accounted associates or joint-ventures and
non-consolidated investments for the proportion that is
part of our value chain. It is to be noted that, for projects’
joint-ventures, the proportion of ownership is correlated
with the proportion of the Joint Venture that is part of
Technip Energies’ value chain.
Accounting boundaries
Technip Energies generates GHG emissions through its 
various activities:
1. Activities related to our buildings, offices, factories,
laboratories, employees and associated commodities;
2. Activities related to projects or “sold products”:
a. Project management services, assistance to client,
engineering and design activities mainly in our offices
throughout the world;
b. Procurement, subcontracted construction activities,
installation on onshore/offshore sites including the
transport and reception of purchased equipment from
vendors, as well as project activities related to
commissioning up to startup;
c. Manufacturing activities of equipment (such as loading
systems) in industrial buildings owned by Technip
Energies.
All these generated GHG emissions are reported and split 
between scopes  1 & 2, scope  3 upstream and scope  3 
downstream based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which 
establishes comprehensive global standardized frameworks 
to manage GHG emissions.

Scopes 1 & 2
Following an Operational Control Approach and aligned with 
our financial reporting under IFRS 16, only emissions related 
to our own use of permanent facilities are reported in 
scopes  1 and 2 as part of Technip Energies facilities, while 
temporary facilities and other activities related to our clients’ 
assets (i.e., our projects) are reported separately under 
scope 3.
For these types of activities, with the addition of our 
business travel, employee commuting and other activities 
related to our own assets and people, which represent 
Technip Energies’ carbon footprint as an engineering and 
services company, carbon footprint annual reporting is based 
on actual accounted quantities for each calendar year.
Quantification methods used for the inventory are in 
accordance with best practice as followed by the GHG 
Protocol, based on the most recently available emission 
factors.
Usage or “activity” data from emission sources is used to 
calculate the emissions. The activity data is multiplied by the 
correlating emission factor, as defined in the GHG Protocol, 
or by engineering evaluations for the respective activities. 
The formula for calculating emissions is: Activity Data x 
Emission Factor = (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFC, HCFC, SF6) Emissions.
All GHG emissions are calculated in metric tonnes of 
pollutant and converted to metric tonnes of CO 2 equivalent 
(or “CO 2eq”) using the corresponding global warming 
potentials (GWPs). The GWPs allow policymakers to compare 
the impacts and reductions associated with various gases in 
our environment, relative to a reference gas. Carbon dioxide 
is the reference gas and has a GWP equivalent to 1. 
GWPs for Technip Energies’ inventory are taken from the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth 
Assessment Report (AR5) using 100-year values. For direct 
emissions (scope 1), fuel-specific emission factors for CO 2, 
CH4, and N 2O are used for all sites worldwide using the 
DEFRA emissions dataset.
Technip Energies’ inventory follows the location-based 
accounting method and the market-based accounting 
method to calculate scope  2 emissions. For the location-
based method, following the scope 2 Guidance from the GHG 
Protocol, Technip Energies uses the national or regional 
emission factors for indirect (scope 2) emissions defined by 
the following methods in each relative geography where 
Technip Energies operates:
■ International Energy Agency (IEA) CO2 Emissions from Fuel
Combustion;
■ for US sites: US EPA Emissions & Generation Resource
Integrated Database (eGRID).
Emission factors were selected based on the following 
hierarchy: regional or subnational grid average (USA only) > 
National production.
For the market-based method, following the scope  2 
Guidance from the GHG Protocol, Technip Energies uses the 
latest available emission factors, published by the electricity 
supplier(s), relating specifically to the carbon intensity of the 
electricity procured. Market-based emission factors for the 
reporting year are collected, along with supporting evidence -
such as Energy Attribute Certificates, supplier invoices. When 
energy certificates or supplier-specific emission rates are not 
available, residual mix should be used for: RE-Diss Europe 
and US residual mix (Green-e).
For the 2023 inventory, we collected financial and 
operational data from each site greater than 500 sqm, which 
in total represents more than 99% of the total surface of the 
buildings owned or rented for our business operations. 
One site in India is excluded from the reporting since it is 
maintained closed and not in operation. The sites that are 
either 100% subleased or partially subleased, or shutdown, 
and do not contribute to our business operations, are 
accounted for scope 3.13.
The data management process includes the collection of 
electricity, heat, cooling and fuels consumption, as well as 
refrigerant leakages, which is fulfilled monthly by data 
owners. Data is controlled by the regional Real Estate 
Manager and by the Real Estate and Facilities Sustainability 
Manager before being published. Activity data is converted to 
the appropriate units for calculating emissions with standard 
emission factors.
When data is not available for one or several months for one 
building (e.g., because the invoice is not yet available), the 
energy consumption is estimated on the basis of the data 
history related to previous months and years.
To cover the sites not included in the data collection (sites < 
500  sqm and one non-active site), we have voluntarily and 
conservatively added a contingency of 5% to the total volume 
of GHG emissions related to our buildings.
The main tools used in Technip Energies for data collection, 
consolidation, analytics, visualization and monitoring of our 
CO2 emissions have been developed internally. The scope 1 & 
2 inventory dashboard is the basis of the site inventory and 
energy uses for GHG reporting. 
The data management process includes the collection of 
invoices and other primary evidence (procurement reports, 
extracts from the third-party providers' reports, etc.) for 
quality control and assurance purposes.
The same data collection process was followed for the few 
external data centers. Emissions from the data centers that 
are hosted in our buildings are accounted for the building’s 
emissions. 
Regarding the fleet of vehicles (service cars) attached to the 
buildings and used for our direct operations, the calculation 
methodology was revised in 2023 and these emissions are 
now reported and included in scope  1 & 2 emissions. 
Emissions from company cars and vehicles used for home-
to-worksite transport are reported in scope 3 (commuting).
Annual GHG reporting is reviewed and validated by Technip 
Energies on an annual basis, as part of Technip Energies’ 
review process. The process is intended to ensure that the 
inventory is complete and accurate, and that it maintains the 
continuous improvement and performance of any ongoing 
environmental sustainability reporting programs, KPIs and/or 
targets.

Scope 3
Most of our scope 3 emissions, which mainly represent the 
life cycle emissions of our projects, our “sold products” 
according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, come from 
scope 3 downstream.
■ Scope 3 upstream is mainly induced by our projects under
development for our clients and is largely based on
anticipated quantification before the plants are started up
and entered into operation.
■ Most of the upstream represents Technip Energies’ carbon
footprint as main or EPC contractor, while the
downstream part represents the use of our “sold
products” – the plants - by our clients.
■ The GHG emissions calculation boundary limits (system
boundaries) are the same as our contractual project
scope, which can be only a part of a larger project
developed by our clients. Life-cycle emissions that are
accounted for in scope  3 are only those from contracts
that are in our portfolio; contracts that we did not win are
excluded from the calculation.
Two families of contracts are in our portfolio:
■ Contract for intellectual services, which includes any kind
of contract that delivers only immaterial assets: advisory,
expertise, studies, consulting, Project Management
Consultancy, basic design, pre-FEED, FEED (competition 
or not, with roll-over to EPC or not), BFS, Detailed Design 
contract, EPs, EPsCm, EPsCa, “ Maîtrise d’œuvre ”, 
assistance to Client, Framework Agreements, etc. In these 
cases, Technip Energies does not deliver any material 
asset. Therefore, no scope 3 GHG emissions are accounted 
for, only GHG emissions related to worked hours.
■ Contract for project delivery, which delivers a material
asset (units, plants, modules, equipments) to a client.
GHG emissions are calculated for the entire project
lifetime from cradle to grave, and reported in
both  scopes  3, upstream and downstream. If a
Technip  Energies contract does not cover the full EPC
scope (EP, EPCm, or consortium partnerships), Technip
Energies reports only the GHG emissions related to its
contractual project scope of works (for an EP contract,
only the procurement and upstream transportation of
goods).
Technip Energies activities include projects that are 
developed for greenfield plants (new plants with no existing 
GHG emissions) or brownfield plants (existing plants that are 
modified and already have existing GHG emissions). For 
brownfield plants, Technip Energies GHG emissions shall only 
be representative of the contractual project scope of works.

Key accounting principles
The GHG emissions calculation and assessment approach 
can follow two philosophies, which can be combined and 
added to ensure the completeness of the quantification:
■ collecting data approach based on, if any, actual
measured data. This methodology is to be used for
activities achieved (actual work);
■ estimating approach based on data quantification. This
methodology is generally to be used for activities not yet
achieved or when data is not fully available (remaining or
planned work).
The Carbon Footprint of Technip Energies is classified within 
two different categories:
■ “Out-of-Project”, covers activities related to buildings,
offices, industrial sites, employees and associated
commodities, for which the GHG emissions annual
reporting is based on actual GHG emissions accounted
(indirectly measured) for each calendar year;
■ “On Project” covers activities related to sold products
(Projects in execution phase), for which GHG emissions
quantification is performed according to estimating
principles and a progressive carbon footprint reporting
mechanism.
Technip Energies bases its calculations as much as possible 
on real data, measured or collected from customers and 
suppliers, and updates the calculations during the project 
development, on a regular basis to incorporate the project 
maturity, data availability or change or modification until the 
completion of the project. For example, if during the lifetime 
of a project, the configuration is planned to be changed 
moving from fossil energy produced in situ to electrification 
with renewable energy, the benefit of the change, if 
sufficiently documented and secured, would be incorporated 
in the calculation.
If a carbon footprint calculation has not been performed for 
an on-going project within Technip Energies’ portfolio, the 
carbon footprint is estimated by extrapolation from other 
projects using GHG emissions per revenue or cost ratios. This 
approach is only applicable for small projects.
A progressive carbon footprint reporting mechanism is 
applied for Technip Energies’ on-going projects portfolio. The 
term “on-going projects” refers here to the projects under 
development between their contract award and 100% 
progress achieved. The part of the project carbon footprint 
corresponding to the progress achieved on the reported year 
is reported each year, from year of contract award and year 
of 100% progress achieved. This approach is aligned with 
IFRS  15 related to revenue progress and recognition and 
aligns Technip Energies’ annual carbon footprint reporting 
with our annual revenue reporting. Although this approach is 
not presented in the GHG Protocol, it was deemed 
appropriate to Technip Energies’ company profile, which 
deals with major “sold” projects of values above Technip 
Energies’ own annual revenue and need several years of 
development between contract award and final acceptance.
Data collection, management and control
A large volume of information is already collected in our 
databases and other IT tools for the needs of various existing 
activities developed on projects and for support functions. 
This information and its digitalization have been analyzed for 
this new purpose of GHG emissions quantification. Especially 
completeness and accuracy of the data and quantities have 
been checked and completed by estimating approaches 
where needed.
For the annual report 2022, the Climate Change and Actions 
teams have ensured the completeness of the reporting 
through centralized actions. In 2023, all methodologies of 
GHG calculation have been deployed to all Operating Centers 
and “on-going projects” in order to make each project and 
each function owner of the process responsible for the 
quality of data reported, and for the reduction actions to be 
implemented and tracked to meet our reduction ambitions.
Each project team uses the engineering and construction 
expertise to make the quantification, based on physical, 
quantified, actual and certified data originally and already 
developed and used by other disciplines for other purposes. 
This approach guarantees a good level of accuracy of the 
calculated figures based on proven and reliable processes 
and data sources well tested internally and by our clients for 
decades. 
On projects, the Technip Energies Project Director is 
responsible for the carbon footprint quantification and the 
reduction objectives of his project. He may be assisted by a 
dedicated Project Carbon Manager but remains responsible 
for the quality and the accuracy of the quantification 
expected at each step of the project development in line 
with Technip Energies methodologies and guidelines even if 
the quantification is carried out by a JV partner or a 
specialized consultant, or the Client or their own 
consultants.
Annual GHG reporting is reviewed and validated by internal 
control, as part of Technip Energies’ review process. This 
process is intended to ensure that the inventory is complete, 
accurate and to maintain continuous improvement and 
performance of any ongoing sustainability reporting 
programs, KPIs and/or targets.

Emission factors used
The large volume of activities achieved on our projects 
needed to be rationalized at the right level of detail to be 
manageable. Semi-consolidation approaches were achieved. 
In parallel, the emission factors existing in numerous external 
databases (e.g., EcoInvent, International Energy Agency (IEA), 
Ademe, Inies, DEFRA, US EPA, Concawe) and provided by 
suppliers and vendors were analyzed, domains of 
applicability checked, adapted to our activities and combined 
for application to known and unknown quantities. An in-
house and appropriate emission factors database has been 
developed for all our engineering disciplines to cover all our 
types of activities.
Avoided emissions
We believe we have to quantify the full CO 2 impact of our 
offers, to drive our decisions and provide expert and decisive 
advice to our clients to meet their GHG emissions reduction 
targets. 
In 2022, we have defined our avoided emissions based only 
on carbon capture solutions in our “on-going projects”. This 
scope represents the reduction of our clients’ emissions 
achieved thanks to our solutions/projects compared to a 
reference scenario or baseline without the solutions/projects 
(i.e., carbon capture units).
The progressive carbon footprint reporting mechanism, as for 
the reporting of scope 3 for “on-going projects” is applied on 
the avoided emissions.
Because of the different nature and variety of the solutions 
and projects that Technip Energies provides, we continue, for 
this year also, to focus the avoided emissions of carbon 
capture projects only.
Pre-investment stages of future projects 
While their carbon footprints do not appear as such in 
Technip Energies annual reporting, we also use these similar 
methodologies and approaches to estimate the full carbon 
footprint of future projects during pre-investment stages 
from conceptual to FEED up to EPC proposals. These 
approaches are sufficiently detailed that the parameters can 
be used at the design phase to lower a project’s overall 
carbon footprint, providing value for our clients and our 
decision-making processes, and contributing to our 
sustainability offer.
Methodological notes regarding Scope 3 GHG emissions (refer to section 4.1. ESG Indicators)
Scope 3.1  - Purchased goods and services: 
■ out of projects, calculation is based on actual quantities
purchased during the year;
■ for procurement of goods on projects:
• calculation is partially based on actual and forecasted
quantities (77% of total carbon footprint value), and
• completed by revenue-based extrapolation for other
projects (23% of total carbon footprint value),
• prorata annual progress.
■ for construction activities on projects:
• calculation is partially based on actual and forecast
quantities (87% of total carbon footprint value), and
• completed by revenue-based extrapolation for other
projects (13% of total carbon footprint value),
• prorata annual progress.
Scope 3.2 -  Capital goods: Calculation is based on annual 
estimated quantities of purchased capital goods for Technip 
Energies industrial sites and offices during the year. It also 
includes all material and equipment purchased during 
construction, refreshment, renovation or re-structuration of 
Technip Energies owned assets.
Scope 3.3 -  Fuel- and energy-related activities (not included 
in scope 1 and scope 2): it covers the extraction, production 
and transport of energy mainly related to scope 1 (well-to-
tank). The quantities of fuels are the same as the ones used 
for scope 1.
Scope 3.4 -  Upstream transportation and distribution: 
Transportation of goods, modules, towing, offshore 
campaigns on projects: 
■ calculation is partially based on actual and forecasted
quantities (80% of total carbon footprint value); and
■ completed by revenue-based extrapolation for smaller
projects (20% of total carbon footprint value);
■ prorata annual progress.
Scope 3.5 -  Waste generated in operations: Calculation is 
based on actual quantities coming from Intelex.
Scope 3.6 -  Business travel: quantities are provided by 
Technip Energies’ Travel agency and calculation is based on 
actual quantities.
Scope 3.7 - Employee commuting: Calculation is based on 
quantities collected by our first employee commuting survey 
launched in November 2023 to all our employees.
Scope 3.8 - Mandatory parts of upstream leased assets are 
reported in other scopes (scope 1 or 2). Manufacturing of 
used equipment, reported in scope  3.1, such as temporary 
site facilities, camps, lifting equipment, site vehicles and 
transportation equipment (vessel, train), is optional and not 
included.
Scope 3.9 - Downstream transportation and distribution: Not 
applicable for EPC projects. Technip Energies’ “sold 
products” are composed of the complete plants which are 
not subject to transportation and distribution and part of 
plants (for modularized plants) which are transported by 
Technip Energies to our clients’ site. Applicable for Technip 
Energies industrial sites (Loading Systems, Cybernetix and 
Dahej) and for EPF projects when the client is transporting 
the modules from the fabrication yards to its final site.
Scope 3.10 -  Processing of sold products: Not applicable for 
EPC projects. Technip Energies’ “sold products” are 
composed of the final plants which are not subject to 
intermediate processing. Applicable for Technip Energies 
industrial sites (Loading Systems, Cybernetix and Dahej) and 
for EPF projects, where processing means integration of the 
equipment and modules by the client into the final unit/
plant.

Scope 3.11 - Use of sold products (operation by our clients of 
Technip Energies’ sold plants and manufactured equipment, 
during their entire lifetime). It covers only the GHG emissions 
of scopes  1 & 2 of our client, from startup activities and 
normal operation (combustion from engines, flaring, vent, 
fugitive emissions, electricity from the grid, etc.). The client’s 
scope 3 is excluded from our calculation.
Scope 3.12 - End-of-life treatment of sold products (our 
clients’ plants). It covers the GHG emissions during the 
deconstruction of the plant and the equipment, and the 
treatment of the wastes: the quantities of equipment and 
material are assumed the same as the ones used for 
construction. 
Scope 3.13 - Downstream leased assets (leased or subleased 
in assets not included in scope 1 or 2): scope 1 & 2 emissions 
from one site located in Houston that is 100% subleased and 
does not contribute to our business operations is accounted 
for this category like few offices with subleased surfaces.
Scope 3.14 -  Franchises: Technip Energies has no franchises 
and consequently this scope  3.14 is not applicable and nil. 
Licenses are not considered as franchises and are reported 
in the same way as other engineering services.
Scope 3.15 - Investments: this scope includes the annual 
Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions of Technip Energies’ investments 
through entities in net-equity and non-consolidated entities 
(they are not included in Technip Energies’ scopes 1 and 2).
4.3. EU GREEN TAXONOMY
Our ESG roadmap is deployed in a context where national 
governments and international bodies are implementing new 
policies to address the effects of a rapidly changing 
environment. The Taxonomy Regulation (the “ EU Taxonomy”) 
is a key component of the European Commission’s action 
plan to redirect capital flows towards a more sustainable 
economy. It consists in a classification system that 
establishes a list of environmentally sustainable economic 
activities. The aim of the EU Taxonomy is to provide 
companies, investors and policymakers with clear definitions 
of economic activities which can be considered as 
environmentally sustainable. This provides clarity and 
security for investors, helps companies to become more 
climate-friendly, mitigates market fragmentation and helps 
to shift investments where they are most needed.
The Taxonomy Regulation came into force on July 12, 2020. It 
sets out the conditions an economic activity must meet to 
qualify as environmentally sustainable. The regulation 
establishes six environmental objectives:
■ climate change mitigation;
■ climate change adaptation;
■ the sustainable use and protection of water and marine
resources;
■ the transition to a circular economy;
■ pollution prevention and control; and
■ the protection and restoration of biodiversity and
ecosystems.
The first delegated act concerning the technical screening 
criteria for economic activities with significant contribution 
to climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation 
(the “Climate Delegated Act” (EU) 2021/2139) was adopted on 
June 4, 2021 and published in the EU Official Journal in 
December  2021. The Climate Delegated Act has been 
amended by the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2485 
adopted on June 27, 2023.
In accordance with Article 8 and Article 10-(2) of the 
Disclosures Delegated Act (EU) 2021/2178 of 6 July 2021, we 
set forth in this section the share of our Group’s revenue, 
capital expenditure (“ CAPEX”) and operating expenditure 
(“OPEX”) for the reporting period 2023, which are associated 
with Taxonomy-eligible economic activities defined in the 
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 and the Delegated 
Regulation (EU) 2023/2485 concerning the two climate 
objectives (climate change mitigation and climate change 
adaptation).
We also disclose in this section the share of our Group’s 
revenue, CAPEX and OPEX for the reporting period 2023, 
which are associated with Taxonomy-eligible economic 
activities defined in the delegated regulation (EU) 2023/2486 
of 27 June 2023 (the “ Environmental Delegated Act ”) 
concerning the four other environmental objectives 
(sustainable use and protection of water and marine 
resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution 
prevention and control, protection and restoration of 
biodiversity and ecosystems).
For the year ended December 31, 2023, entities are required 
to disclose the proportion of their activities that are 
Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-aligned in terms of their 
Turnover, CAPEX and OPEX. This obligation relates to the two 
climate objectives. The evaluation of the alignment has been 
performed by identifying our activities or CAPEX covered by 
the Climate Delegated Act and assessing their alignment to 
technical criteria (substantial contribution criteria), their 
compliance with the “Do No Significant Harm” principle and 
the minimum safeguards.
For the other four environmental objectives (the sustainable 
use and protection of water and marine resources; the 
transition to a circular economy; pollution prevention and 
control; and the protection and restoration of biodiversity 
and ecosystems.), the 2023 obligation only relates to 
eligibility. We have carried out an eligibility analysis 
concerning these four objectives without identifying any new 
eligible activity.

Summary
Based on an exhaustive analysis performed during 2023, and 
given our position in the value chain, our revenue is 
Taxonomy-non-eligible because our activities are not covered 
by the Climate Delegated Act to date and therefore the 
capital and operating expenditures related to our activities 
are also Taxonomy-non-eligible.
However, CAPEX to be reported also includes those that are 
related to the purchase of output from Taxonomy-aligned 
economic activities (such as some real estate activities) and 
enables us to consider a part of our leasing of buildings  and 
our investments related to the installation of renewable 
energy technologies as Taxonomy-aligned.
Regarding our total OPEX that complies with the EU 
Taxonomy definition, it is non-significant in comparison with 
our total consolidated operating expenses and we chose to 
use the materiality exemption option offered by the 
regulation.
Consequently, no revenue is eligible or aligned. OPEX is 
exempted. Only CAPEX is as follow:

Our Assessment
Revenue - Core business activities
As a leading Engineering and Technology company for the 
energy transition, we are contributing to the reduction of the 
energy industry’s environmental footprint by making available 
to our clients the most efficient technologies and by reducing 
the impact of the activities we are conducting. We are 
developing solutions in hydrogen, offshore wind farms, 
ethylene, sustainable chemistry including biofuels and 
biochemicals, circularity, decarbonization projects including 
low-carbon hydrogen and carbon capture utilization and 
storage as well as carbon-free energy (see section  1.5.  A 
presence in traditional and emerging markets of the 2023 
Annual Report).
Taking the entire value chain into consideration, we expect to 
contribute substantially to the energy transition and GHG 
emission reductions in other sectors, as disclosed in the 
2023 Annual Report sections 1.5.1.  Gas & Low-Carbon 
Energies, 1.5.2.  Sustainable Fuels, Chemicals and  Circularity 
and 1.5.3.  Decarbonization solutions. We are actively 
facilitating the use of technologies that aim to reduce GHG 
emissions significantly.
Based on the current application of the eligibility criteria, 
wind power, bioenergies (biogas, biofuels and bioliquids), 
ethylene, hydrogen and storage of CO 2 are broadly listed in 
Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act, notably through the 
activities “3.14. Manufacture of organic basic chemicals”, “3.2. 
Manufacture of equipment for the production and use of 
hydrogen”, “4.13. Manufacture of biogas and biofuels for use 
in transport and of bioliquids”, “4.3. Electricity generation 
from wind power”, “5.11. Transport of CO 2” and “5.12. 
Underground permanent geological storage of CO 2”. Annex III 
to the Climate Delegated Act II also addresses the 
pharmaceutical industry for which Technip Energies plays a 
role, with the activity “1.1 Manufacture of active 
pharmaceutical ingredients (API) or drug substances”. Under 
these activities, the EU Taxonomy targets the manufacture of 
products and technologies or the operation of the facilities, 
but not the engineering and construction of the facilities. 
Therefore, though our activities are not eligible to the EU 
Taxonomy, we nevertheless contribute as an engineering and 
technology company to the energy transition and enable our 
clients to be more sustainable. As Technip Energies, we do 
operate upstream in the value chain of Green Taxonomy 
activities. This does not exclude that, in the future, new 
projects coming from our customers would lead to new 
eligible activities for Technip Energies. In the complementary 
Climate Delegated Act, the Commission has included certain 
gas activities, notably through the activities “4.29 Electricity 
generation from fossil gaseous fuels”, “4.30 High-efficiency 
co-generation of heat/cool and power from fossil gaseous 
fuels” and “4.31 Production of heat/cool from fossil gaseous 
fuels in efficient district heating and cooling system”. Under 
these activities the EU Taxonomy targets the gas energy 
activities as transitional activities, subject to specific 
conditions, which recognize the role gas can play to help 
some regions in their transition from the most polluting solid 
fossil fuel energy sources, such as coal, to renewable energy. 
Therefore, even though Technip Energies provides low-
carbon capital expenditure solutions to the gas industry, our 
revenues are not eligible due to our position in the value 
chain. The gas-eligible activities are restricted to the 
construction or operation for electricity generation or 
production of heat/cool using fossil gaseous fuel.
Concerning material recovery activities, they are addressed 
by the Green Taxonomy in Annex I and II to the Climate 
Delegated Acts, through the activities “2.7. Sorting and 
material recovery of non-hazardous waste” and “5.9. Material 
recovery from non-hazardous waste”. However, the Green 
Taxonomy only covers mechanical transformation processes 
while Technip Energies, as a technology company, is provides 
solutions with chemical processes. Additionally, Annex II 
considers the activity “5.2 Sale of spare parts” but for only 
some sectors, where Technip Energies is not included.
Therefore, according to the Climate Delegated Act, we did 
not identify any Taxonomy-eligible or Taxonomy-aligned 
economic activities among those contributing to our 2023 
annual consolidated revenue.

Capital expenditure (CAPEX)
The CAPEX KPI is defined as Taxonomy-eligible CAPEX 
(numerator) divided by our total CAPEX (denominator). 
Total consolidated CAPEX (denominator) consists of additions 
to tangible and intangible fixed assets during the financial 
year, before depreciation, amortization and any re-
measurements, including those resulting from revaluations 
and impairments, as well as excluding changes in fair value. 
It includes additions to fixed assets (IAS 16), intangible assets 
(IAS 38) and right-of-use assets (IFRS 16). Additions resulting 
from business combinations are also included. Goodwill is 
not included in CAPEX as it is not defined as an intangible 
asset in accordance with IAS 38. For further details on our 
accounting policies regarding our CAPEX, refer to 
section  8.1.6. Notes to consolidated financial statements  of 
our 2023 Annual Report.
Purchase of output from Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-
aligned economic activities and individual measures enabling 
certain target activities to become low-carbon or to lead to 
greenhouse gas reductions can be taken into account 
(section 1.1.2.2. (c) of Annex I to the Article 8 Delegated Act).
We have identified the following economic activities in the 
Climate Delegated Act resulting in CAPEX which can be 
considered as individually Taxonomy-eligible and/or 
Taxonomy-aligned. This CAPEX concerns purchases of output 
related to taxonomy-eligible and aligned economic activities:

In 2023, as in 2022, our Taxonomy-aligned CAPEX mainly 
comprised the increase in right-of-use related to the annual 
rent indexation of our “Origine” Headquarters located in 
Nanterre, France, representing more than 97% of our 
Taxonomy-aligned CAPEX related to activity 7.7 “Acquisition 
and ownership of buildings”. We have performed the analysis 
of the alignment and assessed that our headquarters 
complies with the technical screening criteria of both of the 
climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives. This 
alignment has also been confirmed by the lessor.
To a lesser extent, our Taxonomy-aligned CAPEX also 
comprised our investments related to our installation of solar 
photovoltaic systems (including installation under 
construction).
Our Taxonomy-eligible (but non-aligned) CAPEX comprised:
■ renting and leasing of vehicles, including extensions of
existing lease contracts, independently of their emissions
of CO 2 in relation with the activity “6.5. Acquisition and
ownership of buildings” of the Taxonomy regulation;
■ acquisitions of buildings, including extensions of existing
lease contracts, independently of their use or energy
efficiency in relation with the activity “7.7. Acquisition and
ownership of buildings” of the Taxonomy regulation.
In 2022, our taxonomy-eligible CAPEX comprised in addition 
the acquisitions of infrastructure for data processing 
services, hosting, and related activities, in relation with the 
activity “8.1. Data processing, hosting and related activities” 
and the acquisitions of data-driven solutions for GHG 
emissions reductions in relation with the activity “8.2. Data-
driven solutions for GHG emissions reductions” and the 
acquisitions of research and development solutions for the 
electricity generation from wind power in relation with the 
activity “9.1. Close to market research, development and 
innovation” of the Taxonomy regulation.

Operating expenses (OPEX)
The EU Taxonomy defines operating expenses (OPEX) as 
direct non-capitalized costs that relate to research and 
development, building renovation measures, short-term 
leases, maintenance and repair, and any other direct 
expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of 
property, plants and equipment by the undertaking or third 
party to whom activities are outsourced that are necessary 
to ensure the continued and effective functioning of such 
assets.
Due to our economic activities and our economic model, our 
operating expenses consist primarily of cost of sales, 
representing more than 92% of the total consolidated OPEX 
in 2023 (refer to section  8.1.1. Consolidated statement 
of income of this 2023 Annual Report). 
Consequently, our total operating expenses that comply with 
the EU Taxonomy (denominator), as detailed above, 
represents for the 2023 financial year around €101  million 
and 1.8% of our total consolidated operating expenses. We, 
therefore, chose to use the materiality exemption offered by 
the Regulation, and not to compute this indicator numerator 
which is considered as being equal to zero.
Minimum safeguards
Following the regulatory criteria named “Minimum 
Safeguards”, various Technip Energies policies cover these 
topics, through the adoption of a set of standards, policies 
implemented and best practices applicable to its operations, 
the establishment of specialized teams responsible for 
particular attention to these subjects aimed at ensuring their 
daily application. 
Thus, the Technip Energies Code of Business Conduct 
recognizes human rights as a fundamental principle and the 
Company ensures compliance with human rights (for more 
details refer to section  3.3.3. Human rights due diligence 
program).
In the same way, dedicated standards and policies are set 
out concerning business ethics, anti-corruption, anti-bribery 
and tax (for more details refer to sections  2.2. Sustainability 
Policies and Certifications and 3.3.1. Business Conduct).
In the context of activities carried out by joint-ventures and 
associates in which Technip Energies has significant 
influence, accounted for by the equity method, the Company 
uses its leverage with its business partners to apply similar 
standards.

In 2023, Technip Energies conducted a double materiality assessment following the EU ESRS 
recommendations. The assessment identified 20 material matters under ten ESG topics. 
However, in terms of impact materiality the assessment has identified 17 ESG material 
matters. From the 17 ESG material matters under the impact materiality, for the topics 
“Contribution to circular economy solutions”, “Own workforce working conditions” and 
“Social dialogue for own workforce”, we only identified positive impacts.
The topics “Skills development and talent management in the value chain”, “Corporate 
culture and governance” and “Business ethics” are not impact material but financial material 
for Technip Energies.
