This Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") Report provides an overview of Besi’s 
ESG activities in 2023 including a discussion of the following topics: 
• Overview
• Materiality assessment 
• Strategy 
• Initiatives 
• Governance 
• Reporting framework 
• Environmental impact 
• People wellbeing 
• Responsible business 
A year of progress
Besi has significantly increased its ESG activities and reporting since 2020 including the 
development of various short- and long-term targets through 2050. Since 2019, we have 
reduced Scope 1 & 2 emissions intensity by 65%, fuel consumption intensity by 46%, water 
usage intensity by 34% and absolute hazardous waste generation by 27%. We also 
increased our energy from renewable sources from 18% to 71%. We have also identified and 
commenced work on 85 initiatives associated with our ESG pillars (Environmental Impact, 
People Wellbeing and Responsible Business) many of which have lessened Besi’s ESG 
impact. In fact, we equaled or exceeded substantially all targets for 2022 set in 2019 and 
set new targets in 2022 for achievement in 2024 and 2030 using 2021 data as a baseline. In 
addition, in 2023 we set an objective of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions in our 
operations by 2030, incorporating Scope 1 & 2 emissions. 
In general, we measure our ESG performance in terms of relative intensity targets given 
the highly cyclical nature of our revenue development on a year to year or even multi-year 
basis. Of note, Besi’s performance with respect to most relative intensity targets in 2023 
was adversely affected by two important factors. The first related to the spike we 
experienced in our electricity consumption, Scope 2 emissions and waste disposal in the 
second and third quarters of 2023 associated with the construction of a new production 
facility in Malaysia and the completion of two new cleanrooms in Malaysia and Singapore 
to facilitate growth in Besi’s wafer level assembly operations. The second factor related 
directly to the cyclical revenue volatility of the semiconductor assembly equipment market 
in which we participate. This market experienced a significant downturn in demand starting 
in the second quarter of 2022 and continued through year end 2023. As a result, Besi’s 
revenue declined from a peak of € 749 million in 2021 to € 579 million in 2023. As a result of 
both such factors, all relative intensity ratios and some performance metrics were 
adversely affected this year versus 2022 actual results and 2024 targets. Relative intensity 
ratios began to significantly improve in Q4-23 upon the substantial completion of such 
projects and further migration to renewable energy in Asia. We are currently on track to 
meet or exceed substantially all environmental targets established for 2024.
Since 2019, Besi has significantly expanded the scale and scope of its initiatives and 
reporting activities relative to leading external frameworks such as SASB, GRI, SDG, NFRD, 
TCFD and the EU Taxonomy. We have also proactively responded to external questionnaires 
such as CDP Climate Change and the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment, 
with a focus on materiality, clarity and transparency. In 2020 and 2021, we identified 12 
material topics most relevant to our business, established three material ESG pillars and 
engaged in a four-stage materiality assessment. This framework was applied for our 2023 
report. In addition, we conducted a Double Materiality Assessment as a precondition to 
compliance in 2024 with Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”) 
requirements, assessing the impact of Besi on people and the environment as well as the 
environmental and social-related risks and opportunities to which we are exposed. The 
results of the analysis will be used to further validate our current approach to ESG-related 
topics, make any necessary adjustments to our ESG strategy and comply with the CSRD’s 
European Sustainability Reporting Standards (“ESRS”) in 2024. We also published a formal 
policy on our website this year which provides a strategic view of Besi’s management 
activities across the ESG aspects of our business. In addition, Ernst & Young Accountants 
LLP provided reasonable assurance on our materiality assessment and limited assurance 
on the Environmental, Social and Governance Report included in this Annual Report. Their 
assurance report is included in Other Information. 
In addition, our ESG ratings with the major publicly recognized agencies such as 
Sustainalytics, S&P Global, ISS ESG and MSCI improved significantly in 2023, further 
underscoring Besi’s progress towards best practice metrics. More specifically, we achieved 
a rating of “AA” in the updated 2023 MSCI ESG Ratings Assessment, up from “A” in 2022 and 
“BBB” in 2021. Further, in November 2023, Besi’s ESG Risk Rating declined to 14.4 as per 
Sustainalytics versus 17.8 in 2021 highlighting long-term trend improvement. We also were 
selected for inclusion as a component of the AEX ESG Index in 2022. Such index identifies 
the 25 companies within the combined AEX (large cap) and AMX (mid cap) indices 
demonstrating best in class ESG practices as per criteria assessed by Sustainalytics.
Further, progress continues to advance Besi’s sustainable product design as a core 
component of our sustainable long-term value creation model. As such, we seek to design 
leading edge assembly solutions with high levels of reliability, yield of defect free devices 
and throughput with a lower total cost of ownership including efficiencies in energy and 
material consumption. Toward this end, we developed an initiative named “Design-to-X” 
this year as part of our strategic plan review which included input from our leading 
customers and other stakeholders. This initiative combines Design-to-Cost and Design-
to-Sustainability concepts to identify ESG improvement opportunities in all product 
groups while reducing the cost of many mature die attach and packaging platforms. It is in 
its early stages and builds upon the environmentally friendly product design enhancements 
identified in a collaborative project with the University of Applied Sciences and Arts 
(Lucerne, Switzerland) (“UASA”) over the past three years. The UASA collaboration led to 

Page 3:

the creation of roadmaps with the potential to achieve absolute energy savings of 
approximately 10% per die attach platform over the next five years. Such potential savings 
are material as die attach revenue represented approximately 77% of Besi’s total revenue 
in 2023. Growth in Besi’s installed base of hybrid bonding and other wafer level systems 
also contributes to sustainable product design via an improvement in the overall 
performance, speed, efficiency, cost and energy efficiency of such systems versus those 
using leadframe and substrate assembly technologies. 
In addition, we made considerable progress this year with employee and supplier 
engagement with Besi’s ESG goals and objectives. Many of the defined goals, ambitions, 
and activities we have promoted with such stakeholders since 2019 have been implemented 
and well received by our organization. The results of our bi-annual Employee Engagement 
survey conducted by Willis Towers Watson in 2023 further highlighted this progress. In 
general, Besi scored above the high-tech norm in six of seven categories in this year’s 
survey. Specifically, the survey had a high level of participation (94%) and engagement 
(89%) by our employees. The engagement levels were five percentage points higher than 
the sector’s benchmark. The survey results also indicated a high level of satisfaction with 
our ESG credentials due to a high level of favorable responses to ESG category questions 
(87%). This component scored four percentage points higher than the sector benchmark 
and was our most improved category this year.
Besi also saw increased supply chain participation with respect to ESG topics via an 
enhanced Besi ESG survey. In this regard, we conducted vendor site visits and stakeholder 
interviews and circulated questionnaires at their principal Asian production facilities to 
ensure that our suppliers as well as temporary and contracted third-party workers adhered 
to the standards outlined in Besi’s Supplier Code of Conduct. We also engaged with our 
supply chain through an ESG briefing roadshow, training sessions and the sharing of ESG-
related knowledge. In addition, Besi conducted an ESG assessment survey that focused on 
Besi’s pillars of Environmental Impact, People Wellbeing and Responsible Business. Fifty-
five suppliers were sent this assessment survey with a response received from forty-six 
(84%), representing approximately 50% of our total purchasing volume. Such responses 
were used to create a grading system of either Low Risk, Medium Risk or High Risk. Moving 
forward, Besi will incorporate this ESG scorecard into its periodic audit for annual suppliers. 
Finally, the percentage of purchasing volume which answered the RBA Code of Conduct 
Self-Assessment increased from 62% in 2022 to 66% 2023 marking further progress in our 
supply chain engagement with Besi’s ESG activities. 
Materiality assessment
In 2020, Besi’s management team identified 12 ESG topics most material to our business. 
Such topics formed the basis of our ESG approach and foundation of three strategic pillars: 
Environmental Impact, People Wellbeing and Responsible Business. In 2021, we conducted 
a full assessment of the material topics identified in 2020 by engaging in a four-stage 
materiality assessment involving an industry trend analysis (including consideration of 
SASB standards for the semiconductor industry), peer group benchmarking, key investor 
research and broader stakeholder outreach including employees, customers and suppliers. 
The assessment served to substantiate Besi’s current strategy and understanding of 
material topics with the collaboration of key stakeholder groups to validate their areas of 
interest. In addition, the perspective of investors as a key stakeholder was captured in the 
research phase and factored into the final assessment. The assessment highlighted a 
variety of important themes that can have the most significant positive impact in the 
near-term of which we prioritized four focus areas, (i) energy use and renewable energy, (ii) 
sustainable design (iii) health and safety and (iv) diversity and inclusion. 
Besi Austria employees participated in the Wings for Life World Run 2023.

In 2023, Besi reviewed its 2021 materiality assessment and concluded that the material 
topics identified were still valid. As a result, the same reporting framework was applied to 
ESG reporting for 2023. Besi recognizes increased interest expressed by stakeholders to 
report information as to their dependence on biodiversity and ecosystems. As a result, 
these topics were included within our materiality assessment. We also began conducting 
a Double Materiality Assessment in 2023 according to CSRD requirements as a precondition 
to full compliance by year end 2024. Updated results of this assessment will be included in 
Besi’s 2024 Annual Report. 
Based on the aforementioned materiality assessment performed in 2021 and reviewed in 
2023, the ranking of topics of importance per stakeholder group is listed below for each of 
Besi’s three process pillars: Environmental Impact, People Wellbeing and Responsible

ESG Strategy
Within our three strategic pillars, Besi’s ESG strategy has identified twelve material topics 
and formalized a range of short and long-term targets against which we have committed 
to report. Besi follows the objectives of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”) in 
such reporting whose 17 interlinked goals are designed to be a blueprint for achievement 
by 2030 of a better and more sustainable future. SDG objectives help inform our thinking 
and approach to sustainable business growth. We have aligned the SDGs to which we can 
make the greatest contribution with our strategic pillars. 
ESG initiatives
Since 2020, we increased the number of Besi’s ESG initiatives from 75 to 85 at year end 
2023 (up 13%). Of the total initiatives identified, 65 have been completed and 20 are  
ongoing or scheduled to be implemented over the next few years. The charts below indicate 
the distribution of ESG initiatives per major pillar and Besi’s progress against such 
initiatives. 
ESG topics and initiatives are widely supported by Besi employees at all levels of the 
organization including management, development personnel and production staff.

capabilities. 
• Supported activities and charities in our local communities, particularly in Malaysia, 
China, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Austria.
ESG topics and initiatives are widely supported by Besi employees at all levels of the 
organization including management, development personnel and production staff. 
ESG governance
Besi’s ESG focus and strategic initiatives are integrated into its operations. The Board of 
Management is responsible for setting our ESG strategy and targets as well as its 
implementation and execution. The Supervisory Board has oversight responsibility for 
Besi’s ESG strategy. In addition, ESG issues are assessed monthly by the management 
team including resource allocation and capital investment. 
As such, Besi’s ESG governance and approach is fully aligned with its hierarchal structure. 
SVPs and facility management monitor and track progress against ESG-related goals. 
Progress is then reported to the Board of Management and discussed in detail at Besi’s 
monthly management meeting. Incentives for all such employees are aligned with 
performance against certain specific ESG targets which forms a portion of their variable 
compensation. The Supervisory Board is updated by the Board of Management as to Besi’s 
progress on a quarterly basis. 
All of Besi’s production sites have environmental, health and safety (“EHS”) officers and 
committees and a health and safety management structure. These committees have 
representatives from each department responsible for the inspection, enforcement and 
promotion of EHS matters in the workplace. EHS inspections are conducted quarterly to 
identify and address any unsafe acts and conditions which may exist. Employees also 
regularly receive EHS training. In addition, we have implemented externally certified ISO 
9001 and ISO 14001 management systems to manage quality and environmental topics as 
well as health and safety topics in our operations. Six of seven Besi product operations 
have received ISO 45001 certificates of approval for their occupational health and safety 
management systems with all expected to have received such certification by the end of 
2024. 
ESG reporting framework 
Reporting scope 
The data in this ESG report covers all entities that belong to the scope of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, section 
"Principles of consolidation") excluding the following “Environmental Impact” data: 
• Energy data for four and water data for seven sales and service offices due to their 
immaterial significance.
• Energy, emission, water and waste-related data for our operations in Vietnam due to 
their immaterial significance this year.
Besi is continuously enhancing its ESG methodology and data collection so as to identify 
all material impacts for inclusion in the ESG report. For example, our Scope 3 CO₂ emissions 
from inbound freight at our Dutch plating research and development site were added in 
2023. Comparable numbers for prior years were not adjusted due to a lack of available data.
External reporting frameworks 
As part of our expanded reporting activities, we have analyzed appropriate external 
frameworks to enhance and broaden Besi’s ESG strategy. We have aligned our reporting 
principles with them as much as possible to ensure that Besi’s reporting is appropriately 
aligned with its business and operations.
Besi has prepared the sustainability information in this Annual Report with reference to 
the GRI universal standards for the 1. Foundation, 2. General disclosures and 3. Material 
topics including the reporting principles as included in chapter 4 of GRI 1. Foundation.  
We refer to Annex 2 of our 2023 ESG report for our GRI content index 2023 available at 
www.besi.com. 
In addition, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) published 77 industry 
standards to enable business to communicate material sustainability information to their 
investors. We believe that the semiconductor industry-specific standards and metrics 
provided by the SASB¹ are appropriate for a company of Besi’s business and size. When 
material topics are not covered by SASB, we apply topic specific disclosures from the 
Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) and/or our own developed criteria whenever possible.  
A majority of the requisite information for GRI compliance is available and presented on 
our website including a list of the key topics, metrics and disclosures necessary for 
compliance with SASB as well as a list of material topics with their respective reporting 
criteria (Annex 1 of our 2023 ESG Report). In addition, we intend to assess the applicability 
of other frameworks such as the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards of the 
International Sustainability Standards Board (“ISSB”) and the Taskforce for Nature-related 
Financial Disclosures (“TNFD”). 
1  The SASB Standards became a resource of the IFRS Foundation as of August 1, 2022, upon consolidation of the Value 
Reporting Foundation (which housed the SASB Standards and the Integrated Reporting Framework) into the IFRS 
Foundation.

The CSRD is effective for Besi as of January 1, 2024. As such, we will be required to report 
in accordance with the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) in Besi’s 2024 
Annual Report (published in 2025). In 2023, Besi initiated its CSRD compliance activities, 
implementing various actions to ensure readiness on a timely basis. For instance, we 
started to assess material topics by means of a ‘double materiality assessment’ according 
to ESRS requirements. During 2024, we will conduct a gap assessment against the final 
standards and develop an implementation roadmap to ensure compliance. 
Additionally, we published both a new ESG policy and a Diversity and Inclusion policy which 
can be found on our website. The ESG policy aims to address the material topics involved 
in our business in alignment with our long-term value creation strategy for stakeholders 
while conducting our business in a sustainable way, respecting both the environment and 
society. The Diversity and Inclusion policy outlines what diversity and inclusion means to 
Besi, our goals and what we are doing to promote a diverse and inclusive business culture. 
Such policies will be updated following completion of our Double Materiality Assessment 
and gap analysis versus ESRS standards.
EU Taxonomy 
The EU Taxonomy Regulation (EU 2020/852) (“EU Taxonomy”) is a green classification 
system that determines which economic activities can be considered environmentally 
sustainable under the EU framework. It helps companies, investors, and other stakeholders 
identify and invest in activities that contribute to sustainable objectives.
The EU Taxonomy establishes six environmental objectives, each supported by subsequent 
delegated acts that define related activities and determine technical screening criteria 
(“TSC”): 
• Climate change mitigation (“CCM”).
• Climate change adaptation (“CCA”).
• Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources (“WTR”).
• Transition to a circular economy (“CE”).
• Pollution prevention and control (“PPC”).
• Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems (“BIO”).
The EU Taxonomy requires that any undertaking which is subject to Directive 2013/34/EU 
report on its alignment with the EU Taxonomy’s objectives².  The relevant Key Performance 
Indicators (“KPIs”) for eligibility and alignment are reported as the proportion of turnover, 
capital expenditure (“CapEx”) and operating expenses (“OpEx”). In 2022, the required 
disclosure was limited to eligibility and alignment assessment for CCM and CCA activities. 
Starting in 2023, the disclosure requirement has been expanded to also include the 
eligibility of activities for the remaining four objectives.

Besi’s accounting principles for determining turnover, capital expenditures and operating 
expenses under the EU Taxonomy are aligned with the accounting principles included in 
Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating expenses as per the EU 
Taxonomy have a different definition and are included as a subset of the operating 
expenses reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Circular economy
This year, Besi extended the scope of the EU Taxonomy assessment to the activities 
outlined in the Environmental Delegated Act that came into force in June 2023. Besi has 
identified the following revenue streams and associated economic activities under the 
Circular Economy objective:
• Manufacture of electrical and electronic equipment (CE 1.2), associated with Besi’s core 
activity of manufacturing semiconductor assembly equipment.
• Repair, refurbishment, and remanufacturing (CE 5.1), associated with the extended 
warranty service on the machines purchased from Besi in the past. 
The proportion of the EU Taxonomy eligible revenue is determined as the part of the net 
turnover derived from our products and services associated with CE 1.2 “Manufacture of 
electrical and electronic equipment” and CE 5.2 “Repair, refurbishment and 
remanufacturing”, divided by the net turnover. In addition, Besi derives a portion of its 
revenue from the sale of spare parts. However, in the absence of more granular financial 
reporting information, Besi is unable to distinguish between spare parts and wear and tear 
²  The EU Taxonomy Regulation (EU) 2020/852 as supplemented with Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139, 
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2485 and Commission 
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486.

components (referred to as consumables), a distinction explicitly outlined in the description 
of economic activity “Sale of spare parts (CE 5.2)”. As a result, Besi has opted for a more 
conservative approach by not reporting eligibility for this revenue stream. This category 
will be further examined in the future.
Besi concluded that a portion of the CapEx associated with manufacturing equipment is 
essential to its revenue-generating activities. As a result, the investments associated 
with Besi’s R&D are classified under the activity “Manufacture of electrical and electronic 
equipment (CE 1.2)”. The denominator for the CapEx KPI includes additions to tangible and 
intangible assets during the financial year.
Besi further concluded that a portion of the OpEx associated with the non-capitalized R&D 
costs is related with its core activity of manufacturing semiconductor assembly equipment. 
As a result, these OpEx are classified under the activity “Manufacture of electrical and 
electronic equipment (CE 1.2)”. Total OpEx in the scope of the EU Taxonomy are determined 
based on the non-capitalized costs associated with R&D, building renovation, short-term 
leases, maintenance and repair activities and any other direct expenditures related to the 
day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment. 
The Environmental Delegated Act only mandates the disclosure of eligible amounts under its 
specified objectives for 2023. Reporting on alignment is required in 2024. Besi has proactively 
conducted a preliminary alignment assessment of activities pursuant to the Circular Economy 
objective, as a substantial portion of Besi's revenue falls within the scope of these activities. 
However, it is unlikely that Besi will report high levels of alignment next year in the absence 
of EU Ecolabels for machines manufactured by Besi and the extensive substantial contribution 
and Do Not Significant Harm (“DNSH”) criteria required for the activity pursuant to CE 1.2.
Climate change mitigation
In 2023, Besi made investments to modernize its energy generation system at its site in 
Austria by installing heat pumps and solar panels. As a result, Besi allocated related CapEx 
to the activities outlined under the category “Installation, maintenance and repair of 
renewable energy technologies (CCM 7.6)”. 
To evaluate the alignment of its investments as per CCM 7.6, Besi conducted a detailed 
examination of Technical Screening Criteria. Besi is taking a conservative approach with 
regard to reporting alignment to CCM 7.6 due to insufficient evidence pertaining to the 
DNSH criteria for CCA, although the investments in both heat pumps and solar panels 
meet the substantial contribution criteria. In particular, the DNSH requires a comprehensive 
physical climate risk assessment for sites hosting renewable energy installations. We 
believe the granularity of the climate risk assessment performed by Besi in 2022 under the 
Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”)  falls below the expectations 
set forth in the EU Taxonomy framework. As such, Besi intends to revisit the assessment 
in 2024 to ensure that potential future investments align with the criteria.
Key Performance Indicators

SDG alignment
The following SDGs align with the Environmental Impact pillar of Besi's ESG strategy: 
Goal/description How we contribute
 
Ensure access to affordable, reliable, 
sustainable and modern energy for all. 
We increased the percentage of renewable energy used across our operations to 71% in 2023 which was significantly above the 
25% renewable energy target for 2022. On track to meet the revised 2024 target of 75%. 
 
Build resilient infrastructure, promote 
inclusive and sustainable industrialization 
and foster innovation.
We conduct life cycle assessments as a means of reducing our products’ environmental footprint while increasing their efficiency 
and recyclable content. Toward this end, we have collaborative projects underway with several European universities and launched 
an initiative called Design-to-X to increase Besi’s sustainable system design for each successive product generation.
 
Ensure sustainable consumption and 
production patterns.
The availability and conservation of natural resources is one of today’s largest global challenges. We accept our responsibility by 
concentrating on the procurement of environmentally friendly materials, reducing waste and packaging in our supply chain for 
product manufacturing and increasing our participation in the circular economy.
 
Take urgent action to combat climate 
change and its impacts.
We recognize the urgent global challenge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We contribute to this effort by investigating 
innovative systems and solutions to help reduce emissions during their entire use phase and by providing a transparent overview 
of greenhouse gas emissions as part of our Annual Report. In this regard, we significantly outperformed the 2022 targets for 
Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and fuel and electricity intensity against a 2019 baseline. In 2022, we set new challenging targets for 
achievement by 2024 and 2030 against a 2021 baseline. We aim to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions in our operations by 
2030, incorporating all Scope 1 & 2 emissions. Our long-term objective is to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 in recognition 
of the global ecological and societal imperatives caused by climate change.

In 2023, Besi's absolute fuel consumption declined by 14% versus 2022. However, Besi’s 
electricity consumption increased on both an absolute and relative intensity basis 
compared to 2022 due to the expansion of a new production site in Glenmarie, Malaysia, 
the completion of cleanrooms at our Singapore and Malaysia facilities. In addition, Besi’s 
percentage of renewable energy utilized in 2023 decreased versus 2022 due primarily to 
the limited availability of renewable energy at the Glenmarie site in the first half of 2023. 
However, we were able to purchase renewable electricity for this site in the second half of 
2023 and will continue to do so in 2024. As a result, we expect to meet the 2024 target for 
this KPI. At present we purchase 100% of our electricity needs from renewable source at 
all our European operations. 
Groundwater heat pump project at Besi Austria
During 2023, we invested in a groundwater heat pump at Besi’s Radfeld, Austria facility 
to replace natural gas usage for its central heating system. The project’s aim, in the 
best-case scenario, is to fully substitute gas usage with renewable heat generation and 
to reduce gas usage on an annual basis by approximately 50,000m³, or approximately 
100 tCO₂ emissions. The project is expected to be operational in the first quarter of 
2024.

Carbon emissions 
Reducing Besi’s carbon footprint is a key focus of our ESG strategy. In reporting carbon 
emission levels, we have adopted the standards and methodology put forth by the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol, an independent standard which divides emissions into three scopes: 
• Scope 1 emissions: cover direct greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions resulting from day-to-
day business activities. This category includes on-site fuel combustion such as gas 
boilers as well as manufacturing, transport and fugitive emissions. 
• Scope 2 emissions: cover indirect GHG emissions which result from the electricity, heat 
and steam we purchase from external sources. 
• Scope 3 emissions:  include our emissions resulting from upstream and downstream 
transportation, business flights and non-renewable electricity consumption, 
transmission and distribution losses and well-to-tank, except for the exclusions as 
mentioned in the Reporting Scope section. 
Our ambition is to reduce carbon emissions intensity (carbon emissions/revenue) across 
all three reporting scopes. We exceeded targets in 2022 set in 2019 and intend to meet or 
exceed more challenging targets set for 2024. Toward this end, we aim to reach net zero 
operational greenhouse gas emissions in our operations by 2030, including all Scope 1 & 2 
emissions. 
Our absolute Scope 1 emissions decreased by 38% in 2023 relative to 2022 due to improved 
energy efficiency. Our absolute Scope 2 emissions increased in 2023 relative to 2022 due to 
a variety of construction projects associated with the expansion of our technology and 
production capabilities, including the temporary absence of renewable energy available at 
the Glenmarie, Malaysia site. 
In addition, both Besi’s Scope 1 & 2 and Scope 3 emissions intensity increased in 2023 
relative to 2022 due primarily to the significant downturn experienced in the semiconductor 
assembly equipment industry which caused our revenue to decline by 20% year over year. 
However, Besi has reduced its Scope 1 & 2 emissions intensity versus the 2021 baseline by 
5.5 tCO₂ emissions/€million revenue, or 38%, as a result of the accelerated implementation 
of renewable energy across our Asian and European facilities. 
Furthermore, Besi has reduced its absolute Scope 3 emissions versus our 2021 baseline by 
2,099 tCO₂e, or 18%, reflecting progress in the areas of transportation, freight and travel 
as well as the beneficial impact of a higher proportion of leading edge assembly systems 
in our product mix. In 2023, Besi’s Scope 3 emissions intensity increased to 17.0 tCO₂e 
emissions/€million revenue, a 7% increase versus the 2021 baseline. 
Installation of solar power reduced energy usage at Besi Austria
We expanded a solar roof and increased the usage of photovoltaics systems in 2023 at 
Besi’s Radfeld, Austria facility to help reduce aggregate energy consumption and Scope 
2 emissions. The solar cells utilized were assembled using Besi’s own equipment.

Waste and hazardous waste disposal
We seek to reduce the waste and hazardous waste produced by our operations wherever 
possible. In all facilities, waste separation systems are in place and the re-use, reduce, 
recycle concept is well established. The principal focus of our efforts is the reduction of 
waste used in the packaging process wherein we use materials such as plastic, wood and 
cardboard to ensure proper protection. There was an increase in Besi’s absolute waste 
produced and waste intensity in 2023 relative to 2022. The launch of the new Glenmarie, 
Malaysia site, the scrapping of obsolete materials at Besi Austria in the first half of 2023 
and refurbishments to the assembly space at Besi Netherlands all contributed to the 
increase in absolute waste. The increase in absolute waste combined with the significant 
revenue decline experienced by Besi in 2023 led to a significant increase in our waste 
intensity this year. Given that these construction activities were completed in 2023, we 
anticipate reducing waste intensity materially in 2024 and intend to meet or exceed our 
2024 intensity target in this area.

Water withdrawal
Water conservation is another priority. Virtually all water used in our operations is 
discharged back into local water systems. As a result, our net water usage is limited. In 
addition, Besi does not operate in any regions with a high or very high-water risk as defined 
by the World Resources Institute. Besi utilized approximately 30 million liters of fresh 
water in its operations in 2023 of which approximately 90% was utilized in our Asian 
production operations. Water withdrawal intensity increased this year due to the 
significant revenue decrease experienced.

Sustainable design 
Besi develops high quality, premium priced system solutions for customers offering 
leading edge reliability, accuracy, throughput, system uptime, yield of defect free devices, 
longevity and low environmental impact. We have implemented externally certified ISO 
9001 and ISO 14001 management systems to manage quality and environmental issues in 
our production operations. In addition, six of seven Besi operations have received ISO 
45001 certificates of approval for their occupational health and safety management 
system. Our development efforts focus on system efficiency both in terms of environmental 
impact and productivity/cost savings with a particular emphasis on: 
• Leading edge product innovation. 
• Energy efficiency. 
• Recycling potential of applied production materials. 
• Recycled content used in our products. 
• Exclusion of hazardous components in our systems. 
• Exclusion of conflict materials from our design process.
We prioritize sustainable design in our system development efforts and conduct life cycle 
assessments as a means of reducing their environmental footprint while increasing their 
efficiency and recyclable content. As a result, we can provide customers a low total cost 
of ownership and an attractive return on initial investment while promoting sustainability 
themes.

In 2021, we launched several sustainable design initiatives focused on design-to-cost, 
quality and sustainability. Such initiatives were focused on upgraded versions of our 
mainstream die bonding product lines as well as for new wafer level assembly platforms 
such as hybrid bonding and next generation TCB chip to wafer systems. We also participated 
in a project with the University of Applied Sciences and Arts (Lucerne, Switzerland) to 
identify potential areas of cooperation with respect to environmentally friendly product 
design. Internal projects were also commenced to analyze product lifecycles in multiple 
product groups to further extend their useful lives. 
In 2023, Besi increased its focus on sustainable design initiatives related to energy 
consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Toward this end, we developed an initiative 
named “Design-to-X” as part of our strategic plan review. This initiative combines Design-
to-Cost and Design-to-Sustainability concepts to identify ESG improvement opportunities 
in all product groups while reducing the cost of many mature die attach and packaging 
platforms. More specifically, the review analyzed the ways Besi could reduce its greenhouse 
gas emissions and energy use and minimize the carbon footprint for its end-users while 
increasing product performance and efficiencies in design, procurement and operations. 
We have developed certain key deliverables utilizing Besi’s existing sustainable engineering 
efforts and plan to engage with customers who derive the greatest value from 
decarbonization efforts. 
In addition to such initiatives, we completed a wastewater treatment project this year in 
collaboration with the Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development at Utrecht 
University, the Netherlands, to measure the ecological footprint of Besi’s plating systems. 
The project highlighted reduced electricity consumption as a priority in our sustainable 
design efforts for this platform.
Besi’s systems can also be customized, reconfigured and redeployed over their product 
lifespan thus extending their useful life as well as reducing their environmental impact 
and raw material consumption. Customer utilization of our extensive global network of 
field service and spare parts also helps customers extend the useful life of our systems.
Future sustainable design priorities
• Realization of benefits from Design-to-X initiative. 
• Optimization of material selection and consumption.
• Optimization of transport packaging.
• Sourcing from more sustainable suppliers.
• Implementation of performance and design initiatives at the component level.
• Logistics optimization.
• Enhance energy efficiency and usage of renewable energy at our Asian facilities.
• Reduction of discretionary travel.
Besi Switzerland collaborating on environmentally friendly product design
In 2021, we commenced participation in a project with the Lucerne University of Applied 
Sciences and Arts (Switzerland) to identify potential fields of interest for more 
environmentally friendly product design. Different scenarios involving customers, 
production locations and processes were examined and highlighted a range of 
environmental influences. As a result of our collaborative efforts, we set a target to 
reduce energy consumption of our die attach platforms by 10% by 2027. We are 
developing a ten-year roadmap to create additional energy savings programs.

SDG alignment
The following SDGs align with the People Wellbeing pillar of Besi's ESG strategy:
Goal/description How we contribute
 
Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being 
for all at all ages.
Employee health, safety and wellbeing are material topics. Besi’s production sites have EHS officers and committees and a 
health and safety management system and procedures. EHS committees are responsible for the inspection, enforcement and 
promotion of health and safety matters in the workplace. Employees also regularly receive EHS training. 
 
Achieve gender equality and empower all 
women and girls.
We are committed to improving gender diversity across all operations and providing equal opportunities for all employees. We 
increased the percentage of women in management from 14% in 2019 to 17% in 2023. We are committed to further increasing 
the percentage of women in management and women in the workforce but recognize the difficulties achieving such goals per 
region due to the limited number of qualified personnel available.
 
Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable 
economic growth, full and productive 
employment and decent work for all.
We are committed to providing a safe and secure working environment for all employees. All employees are made aware of 
their rights including the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining. 
Besi is committed to being a good employer and promoting a workplace culture supporting 
the achievement of its business and ESG objectives. We comply with all applicable 
employment laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. All employees are 
made aware of their rights including the right to freedom of association and collective 
bargaining. We seek to be a preferred employer by emphasizing the diversity, health, safety 
and wellbeing of our employees, flexible working arrangements and career growth and 
development. In 2023, the Supervisory Board approved a companywide ESG policy that has 
been published on our corporate website. This policy outlines Besi’s commitment to 
employee engagement and career development, diversity and inclusion, equal opportunity, 
elimination of discrimination and health and safety.

New hires 6% 8% 19% 11% 10%
As indicated in the tables above, our fixed and temporary headcount levels vary significantly 
from year to year depending on conditions in our cyclical semiconductor assembly 
equipment market. In market upturns, headcount typically increases. Conversely, in 
downturns, headcount is reduced in alignment with decreased demand, particularly as it 
relates to temporary production personnel. Similarly, new hiring also follows market 
movements with higher percentages experienced in industry upturns and lower ratios 
realized in industry downturns. Employee turnover typically, but not always, follows such 
cyclical market influences. Turnover is typically lower in downturns where employees are 
less likely to seek employment elsewhere and higher in industry upturns where there is 
more demand for personnel industry wide. 
Diversity and inclusion 
Besi values and encourages cultural, age and gender diversity in its workforce. Management 
believes that diversity and inclusion help broaden our perspective and contribute to 
growth. Diversity and inclusion are priority topics in Besi’s ESG strategy with improved 
gender diversity across all operations the most immediate focus. We recognize that 
women continue to be underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and 
mathematics fields and is thus a priority in recruiting efforts. Many of our product groups 
and manufacturing sites engage with local universities to drive growth in diversity 
representation. Our newly published ESG policy and Code of Conduct also emphasize equal 
opportunity for all employees and applicants. Specifically, the Diversity and Inclusion 
policy outlines what diversity and inclusion means to Besi, our goals and what Besi is 
doing to promote a diverse and inclusive business culture.

Besi’s diversity efforts indicate slow but steady progress as measured by an increasing 
percentage of female managers and local managers in the workforce since 2019. However 
in 2023, Besi reported a decrease in the female managers indicator due to promotion of 
several male employees to management positions in Besi APac.
National Future Day
On November 9, 2023, Besi Switzerland participated in National Future Day 2023 which 
provides schoolchildren insight into gender atypical professions. The objective was to 
provide schoolchildren with the courage and confidence to take charge of their future 
outside of gender images. As engineering tends to be an underrepresented female 
profession, Besi Switzerland showed participants  what a career in the semiconductor 
industry involves and provided tutorials on how to use some of Besi’s technology 
including a course on how to code and use a soldering iron. 
Employee health and safety 
Employee health and safety represents another material ESG topic. Besi monitors incidents 
in the workplace at all locations worldwide. Incidents are grouped into categories by 
severity: (i) fatalities, (ii) major absences (more than four days), (iii) minor absences (less 
than four days) and (iv) first aid cases in which employees can resume work immediately 
after treatment or the following day. Safety hazards at Besi are limited. There were three 
safety incidents recorded last year at Besi’s Malaysian and Meco operations of which two 
were first aid cases and one was a minor absence. In general, incidents are few as our 
production facilities are predominantly clean environments with no heavy chemicals 
present. In addition, there were no legal proceedings related to health and safety incidents 
in 2023. We are committed to be compliant with all local laws. Our facilities in Austria, 
China, Malaysia, Singapore, Switzerland and our Meco facility in the Netherlands are ISO 
45001 compliant. We expect our Duiven, Netherlands facility to be ISO 45001 compliant 
and certified by the end of 2024.

Improved working conditions Besi Leshan
Work began at our Besi Leshan facility to optimize safe working conditions for 
employees. The facility received ISO 45001 certification in 2023 which represents further 
external validation of Besi’s commitment to occupational health and safety 
management.
Employee engagement and career development 
One of Besi’s principal challenges is to attract, motivate and retain skilled workers critical 
to our success in a highly competitive semiconductor equipment industry. A key component 
of our strategy is training and talent development for which we provide a variety of 
educational programs companywide. In addition, we monitor employee engagement and 
satisfaction across all regional operations and conduct surveys to assess our relative 
success in such activities. Increases in training hours per employee in 2022 were favorably 
influenced by a Chinese government sponsored online training program. In 2023, training 
hours remained roughly equivalent to 2022.

SDG alignment
The following SDG aligns with the Responsible Business pillar of Besi's ESG strategy: 
Goal/description How we contribute
 
Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide 
access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions 
at all levels.
Besi’s ESG policy, Code of Conduct and Whistleblower procedure guide the activities of our 
employees. Our ESG policy provides a strategic view of Besi’s management across the 
environmental, social and governance aspects of our business related to both our 
operations and value chain. All new employees are required to sign the Code of Conduct 
and undertake training upon hiring. All other employees undergo training on a regular 
basis. Besi’s Supplier Code of Conduct outlines the standards expected of our suppliers in 
areas such as human rights, product quality, health and safety and the environment. 
Besi operates in a responsible and sustainable manner for the benefit of all stakeholders. 
We are committed to the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adhere to high ethical 
standards and expect the same commitment from key stakeholders, particularly across 
our supply chain. We strive to have a positive impact on the communities and countries in 
which we operate via charitable activities, by following responsible tax practices and by 
maintaining open, constructive and mutually respectful relations with tax authorities. In 
2023, the Supervisory Board approved a companywide ESG policy that has been published 
on our corporate website. This policy outlines the Company’s commitment to ethics and 
corporate culture, engagement with employees and external stakeholders, political 
involvement, and transparent reporting.
Ethics and compliance
The importance of appropriate anti-corruption and human rights policies has increased 
with the expansion of Besi’s Asian operations, supply chain and logistics activities. In this 
regard, Besi has an ESG policy, Code of Conduct and Whistleblower procedure (all of which 
are available on our website) to guide employee activities and to set out the responsibilities, 
procedures and support functions in reporting violations. In addition, all employees are 
required to sign our Code of Conduct and undertake training upon hiring. Further, we 
conduct training for all employees globally on a regular basis. Besi’s Code of Conduct also 
prohibits anti-competitive practices. There were no legal proceedings associated with 
anti-competitive behavior over the past three years. 
Our confidential Whistleblower procedure enables employees to report suspected cases of 
misconduct. These cases are investigated immediately and overseen by local management 
and the Board of Management, who have responsibility for approving appropriate corrective 
measures. 
Responsible supply chain
Besi adheres to high ethical standards and expects the same from its suppliers. As such, 
we have three policies in place to promote a sustainable supply chain: a Conflict Minerals 
policy, a Supply Chain policy and a Supplier Code of Conduct based on the code published 
by the Responsible Business Alliance (“RBA”). The Code of Conduct is based on international 
norms and standards including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International 
Labor Standards and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Besi’s Supply 
Chain policy and Code of Conduct have been fully in accordance with RBA requirements 
since 2018. In addition, we seek to align our operations and supply chain with the Restriction 
of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”) directive. In 2023, 93% of our relevant purchasing 
volume was compliant with the RoHS directive. In addition, we have begun engagement 
with suppliers as to the origin of their imported steel and iron supplies due to new EU 
restrictions.
Besi is committed to improving the sustainability of its supply chain. Our supply chain 
activities include the sourcing of raw materials, components and semi-finished products 
from vendors. The issue of conflict minerals is an important topic for supply chain 
management, particularly in Europe and North America. We seek to minimize the impact of 
conflict minerals wherever possible. In 2023, Conflict Mineral Reporting Template 
Questionnaires were returned by suppliers representing 71% of material related purchasing 
volume, a slight decrease versus the 73% recorded in 2022. 

Page 30:
30
With respect to human rights, we follow the RBA Code of Conduct both in our production 
facilities and supply chain. Labour standards in the RBA Code of Conduct include: 
• Freely chosen employment 
• Young workers 
• Working hours 
• Wages and benefits 
• Humane treatment 
• Non-discrimination/non-harassment 
• Freedom of association 
In 2019, Besi achieved gold status with the RBA which is externally audited and accredited. 
In 2023, 88 suppliers were responsible for approximately 80% of Besi’s total purchasing 
volume. As a result, we established a risk map matrix to assess the importance, reliability, 
financial condition and sustainability of all suppliers on a more regular basis. Besi evaluates 
suppliers by means of its quarterly business review process under which we regularly 
conduct performance reviews and key supplier audits. In 2023, the number of supplier 
performance reviews and audits was 63% of our total purchasing volume, equal to 2022. 
Engagement with suppliers also resulted in additional progress on ESG topics in 2023. Our 
Malaysian and Chinese operations began a more comprehensive engagement strategy 
with suppliers this year through an ESG briefing roadshow, training sessions and the 
sharing of ESG-related knowledge. We also conducted an ESG assessment survey that 
posed questions related to Besi’s material ESG pillars of Environmental Impact, People 
Wellbeing and Responsible Business. Concerning the Environmental Impact pillar, we 
asked suppliers whether targets had been set to help reduce Besi’s energy usage, carbon 
emissions, waste and hazardous material usage as well as their usage of renewable 
energy. Fifty-five suppliers were sent this assessment survey with a response received 
from forty-six (84%), representing approximately 50% of our total purchasing volume. 
Such responses were used to create a grading system of either Low Risk, Medium Risk or 
High Risk. For each risk category, an action plan was created for supplier engagement to 
ensure improvement in their management of ESG-related issues. Moving forward, Besi will 
incorporate this ESG scorecard into its periodic audit for annual suppliers. 
Finally, the percentage of purchasing volume which answered the RBA Code of Conduct 
Self-Assessment increased from 62% in 2022 to 66% in 2023 marking further progress in 
our supply chain engagement with Besi’s ESG activities.

Community impact
Besi supports activities in the local communities in which it operates, particularly in Asia 
where the assistance is more greatly needed. In Malaysia, activities undertaken in 2023 
included a tree planting hiking trail in Taman Botani Negara. In addition, Besi’s Chinese 
operations supported their community by providing lectures to Leshan primary school 
children and by training eight school students for Leshan’s vocational school. In total, 
both initiatives amounted to 600 hours of community support. Besi Leshan also donated  
¥ 10,000 RMB to the ‘Star Charity’ which was endorsed by the Leshan Import and Export 
Chamber Commerce. The charity raised ¥ 728,000 RMB to provide support to those in 
poverty.
At Besi Netherlands, we conducted a Christmas promotion to raise funds for “Stichting 
Kinderen van de Voedselbank” , a charity that combats the social consequences of child 
poverty in the Netherlands. It is the only foundation in the Netherlands that donates 
clothing packages to children, all of which are new clothes rather than those that have 
been used and donated. Besi employees managed to raise € 7,740 for this charity. At our 
Meco facility in the Netherlands, 35 of our employees engaged in community service with 
a charity called Cello. This program generated € 4,375 in social value through the number 
of hours volunteered.
Besi Austria supported local technical universities and schools through donations, active 
interchange and dialogue. In addition, they hosted a Girls Day career orientation project for 
girls and young women. Points of contact were established between female students for 
future-oriented professions in the fields of technology, natural sciences, and computer 
science. Other career orientation days were also held during the year. 
On November 9, 2023, Besi Switzerland participated in National Future Day 2023 which 
provides schoolchildren insight into gender atypical professions. The purpose of the day 
was to provide schoolchildren with the courage and confidence to take charge of their 
future outside of gender images. As engineering tends to be an underrepresented female 
profession, Besi Switzerland showed participants what a career in the semiconductor 
industry involves and provided tutorials on how to use some of Besi’s technology including 
courses on coding and the use a soldering iron.
Besi APac partnership with the Ideas Academy
Besi APac continued its long-term partnership with the Ideas Academy which provides 
high quality, affordable virtual education and in-person classes for students in Kuala 
Lumpur.
Tax practices 
Besi’s global tax policy views taxation, including the payment and collection of taxes, as 
an integral part of its business and an important part of its social responsibility and 
contribution to society. Besi’s tax policy is aligned with its ESG Strategy and follows the 
principle of responsible tax practices whereby Besi’s legitimate interests, reputation and 
corporate social responsibility are taken into consideration. In this respect, the interests 
of all stakeholders are taken into consideration including customers, shareholders, local 
governments and the communities and countries in which Besi operates. Besi’s global tax 
policy is annually updated and signed off by the Board of Management. 
It consists of the following principles:
• We commit to paying taxes on time and in accordance with all applicable laws and 
regulations. 
• Our tax policy follows Besi’s business. As such, our profits are allocated to the countries 
in which business value is created, taxes are paid and where factual economic activities 
are executed. In addition, all transactions must have a business rationale. 
• Intra-group transactions are entered into on an arm’s length basis and adhere to the 
guidelines issued by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(“OECD”). 
• We strive to comply with the letter and spirit of applicable tax laws and regulations and 
are guided by relevant international standards. 
• We seek a competitive, stable, sustainable and explainable effective corporate tax rate 
whereby tax incentives and subsidies are used. Any tax optimization must be based on 
opportunities provided by law or case law and must be aligned with our business and 
objectives.
• Besi does not undertake transactions whose sole purpose is to create an abusive tax 
result. In addition, Besi does not use artificial tax structures in tax haven jurisdictions as 
defined by the OECD. 

Page 32:
32
• We seek to establish and maintain an open and constructive dialogue with tax authorities 
and other government bodies in all jurisdictions where we operate based on the 
disclosure of all relevant facts and circumstances. We discuss important fiscal aspects 
upfront with the relevant tax authorities if questions arise as to proper taxation policy. 
We also seek rulings from tax authorities to confirm the applicable treatment. In the 
Netherlands and Switzerland, jurisdictions where Besi has substantial operations, we 
engage with the Tax Authorities through regular meetings, telephone calls and other 
correspondence.
The effective tax rate for 2023 was 14.7% (2022: 12.6%). Similar to 2022, income tax expense 
for the 2023 fiscal year was affected by foreign tax rates differentials, non-deductible 
expenses, tax-exempt income, tax credits, changes in valuation allowances on deferred 
tax assets and benefits from preferential tax regimes legislated by the countries concerned 
in order to promote economic development and investment. Further details regarding 
income tax expense are provided in Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Future Responsible Business priorities 
• Conduct supply chain audits representing 75% of Besi’s purchasing volume by 2030 in 
accordance with our new supply chain risk matrix. 
• Enhance our supplier evaluation process in the areas of lead time, quality and 
technological capabilities. 
• Encourage more suppliers to join the CFSI such that 80% of Besi’s purchasing volume 
has signed by 2030. 
Besi’s future ESG priorities
Besi’s mission is to become the world’s leading supplier of semiconductor assembly 
equipment for advanced packaging applications and to exceed industry average 
benchmarks of financial performance. We also strive to create long-term value for our 
stakeholders and operate our business in a sustainable way, respecting the environment, 
our own employees and the wider society. Besi is committed to running its operations in 
accordance with internationally recognized standards and best practices and to promote 
sustainability with all stakeholders through the reporting on material ESG topics on an 
annual basis in line with regulatory standards.

Annex 4: Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
TCFD 
Besi recognizes the adverse effects caused by the emerging climate change crisis and 
carefully monitors the impact of climate change on our operations. In addition, we 
recognize increasing interest from customers and investors on climate topics and support 
the activities of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”). Our 
objective is to comply with its recommendations to provide greater transparency in the 
reporting of climate-related risks and opportunities. Additionally, we have used TCFD’s 
guidance and conducted a climate change risk assessment using various scenarios to 
inform the development of Besi’s climate strategy.
This is our second year reporting against TCFD recommendations. In accordance therewith, 
we have made climate-related disclosures in the Annual Report 2023 broadly in line with 
their recommendations on the following topics:
• Governance (all recommended disclosures)
• Strategy (all recommended disclosures)
• Risk management (all recommended disclosures)
• Metrics and targets (all recommended disclosure)
In the future, we intend to evaluate our practices and consider opportunities to enhance 
disclosures on an ongoing basis in order to expand best practice reporting against ESG 
frameworks.

Recommended disclosure: a. Describe the board’s oversight of climate-related risks and 
opportunities.
Besi’s Board of Management is responsible for the direction of our ESG strategy which 
includes climate-related issues. Developments with respect to Besi’s ESG initiatives are 
discussed regularly with the Supervisory Board where we present progress against goals 
and targets for climate-related issues. 
In 2020, we introduced ESG reporting on a quarterly basis. Reporting data is used to 
evaluate Besi’s ESG progress and risks which include climate change, natural resource 
conservation and pollution. Short- and long-term topics are also addressed through 
measures such as a materiality analysis, key performance indicators for Scope 1, 2 and 3 
emissions, water and energy consumption and waste disposal, customer satisfaction and 
employee engagement metrics, supplier audits, stakeholder dialogue and climate-related 
scenario analysis.
Recommended disclosure: b. Describe management’s role in assessing and managing 
climate-related risks and opportunities.
The Board of Management is responsible for defining and achieving Besi’s strategy and 
ESG objectives. Day-to-day responsibility resides with the SVPs and facility management 
in their respective departments and locations. Senior management is engaged to (i) assess 
climate-related issues, (ii) develop climate-related initiatives and (iii) monitor and track 
progress against Besi’s climate-related targets as follows:
• CTO Office (responsible for supporting sustainable solutions for Besi’s assembly 
equipment).
• SVPs Product Groups (responsible for climate-related aspects associated with 
sustainable design such as lower material consumption over product life cycles and 
management of Besi’s product group operations).
• SVP Operations (responsible for managing Besi’s production sites and for climate change 
related aspects of operations such as increasing the energy efficiency of its facilities).
• VP Strategic Supply Management (responsible for collection of sustainability related 
information from our suppliers and monitoring compliance with Besi’s responsible 
supply chain and Supplier Code of Conduct).
• VP Strategic Sourcing (responsible for review and presentation of Besi’s progress per 
ESG initiatives across its facilities and product lines).
• SVP Finance (responsible for ESG data review including data collection, co-ordination of 
ESG reporting and analysis of target versus actual results).
Strategy 
Disclose the actual and potential impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the 
organization’s business, strategy and financial planning where such information is 
material.
Recommended disclosure: a. Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the 
organization has identified over the short-, medium-, and long-term.
Besi considers climate-related risks and opportunities across three time horizons:
• Short-term (0-2 years): The annual budget includes capital expenditures for our 
production facilities over a two-year time period.
• Medium-term (period up to 2030): This period is considered the timeframe for major 
product and market trends in alignment with our five-year planning cycle.
• Long-term (2030 - 2050): Climate risks based on our scenario assessments that align 
with a 2050 horizon.
The tables below generally describe the climate-related risks considered over the 
timeframes described above. We plan to further evaluate these risks and their associated 
business impacts in a more comprehensive manner in future years:

Recommended disclosure: b. Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities 
on the organization’s businesses, strategy and financial planning.
We have defined our climate-related goals and ambitions with specific targets identified 
to guide our activities until 2030, set the objective of net-zero carbon emissions in our 
operations and the objective of net zero carbon emissions. We have determined targets 
per location to reduce our energy and water usage, hazardous and non-hazardous waste 
and CO2 emissions. As a result, we are focused on addressing such risks by integrating 
climate considerations into Besi’s sustainable design efforts, facility investments and 
energy/resource efficiency as detailed below: 
• Sustainable Design
Besi continually seeks potential opportunities to develop new ways to assemble 
semiconductors and components used in advanced electronic applications. We have 
proactively developed a more efficient and cleaner industry through our products, 
particularly low carbon products and services in order to help customers operate more 
efficiently and in a more environmentally friendly and cost saving manner. Furthermore, 
we offer upgrade kits to customers for certain product series which can increase the 
lifespan of our systems. 
For more information, please refer to page 71 of our Annual Report 2023, where we highlight 
the favorable results of our collaboration with the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences 
and Arts (Switzerland) as well as the inceptin of our “Design-to-X” intiative. These 
initiatives help ensure that we keep pace with the transition to a net-zero economy by 
complying with potential regulations, providing energy efficient technology and by 
maintaining a strong reputation with stakeholders. 
• Facility Investments
Over the past three years, we have made investments in our facilities to facilitate the 
adoption of renewable energy technologies. Such investments were targeted to reduce 
transitional risks and included: 
• Purchase and utilization of Solar PV panels at the Besi APac and Besi Austria facilities. 
• Installation of a groundwater heatpump at Besi’s Radfeld, Austria facility to replace 
natural gas usage for its central heating system.
• Renewable energy procurement from local electricity suppliers. 
• Installation of E-charge stations at our Austrian, Chinese, Dutch and Swiss facilities. 
• Conversion of company cars from ICE to hybrid or electric. 
• Capital spending to reduce the risk of flooding at our Malaysian facility.

We will continue to assess investment opportunities in the future to improve the resilience 
of our facilities. This assessment includes the prioritization of actions at our most 
vulnerable locations based on the scenario analysis conducted in 2022. 
• Energy/Resource Efficiency
Additionally, we have worked on becoming more energy efficient through the purchase and 
utilization of more energy-efficient process technologies and the better insulation of our 
facilities. Such initiatives have included: 
• LED light and Smart meter installation. 
• Air compressor replacements. 
• Upgraded heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) units. 
• Better management of the transport mix of our freight operations with a focus on local 
sourcing. 
• Installation of sun/heat protective foils. 
• Implementation of sustainable design methods in certain of our Die Attach platforms.
Recommended disclosure: c. Describe the resilience of the organization’s strategy, taking 
into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2 °C or lower scenario.
Besi engaged an external consultant in 2022 which conducted a scenario-based climate 
change risk assessment exercise to determine the potential implications of climate risks 
on our business. The objective of the exercise was, in part, to strengthen the resilience of 
our ESG and climate related strategies moving forward. Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (“IPCC”) warming scenarios were utilized to build our Besi-specific 
scenarios. The IPCC provides pathways for assessing the physical impacts of climate 
change utilizing varying degrees of GHG atmospheric emissions. The majority of the 
publicly available climate-related scenario assumptions do not directly impact Besi 
because they focus primarily on transitions for heavy-emitting sectors such as utilities. As 
such three qualitative transition scenarios were drafted from existing scenarios and trends 
and then combined with three warming scenarios: 
• Business-as-usual 
RPC 8.5 – Extremely high emissions scenario with the global mean temperature expected 
to rise by 3.7 °C (2.6-4.9 °C) by the end of the 21 st century. The scenario assumes a high 
dependence on fossil fuels and no policy-driven mitigation. 
Qualitative assumptions: 
• Limited impact of emissions performance on Besi’s reputation and market value. 
• Available technologies do not have the capability for large scale emissions reduction. 
• Reduced investment in new technologies due to high costs and limited public sector 
incentives. 
• Delayed transition
RPC 6.0 – High emissions scenario with global mean temperature expected to rise by 2.2 °C 
(1.4-3.1 °C) by the end of the century assuming emissions peak around 2080 and then 
decline. 
Qualitative assumptions: 
• Inconsistent regulation. 
• Uneven impact of emissions performance on Besi’s reputation and market value. 
• Reduced demand in geographies with high vulnerability and exposure to climate risks. 
• Net-zero
RPC 2.6 – A stringent pathway with a large regulatory push. The development of new 
technologies increases the probability of keeping global temperature growth below 2 °C by 
2100. 
Qualitative assumptions:
• Strict regulation. 
• Large impact of emissions performance on Besi’s reputation and market value. 
• Customers have high interest in more energy efficient/lower emission products which 
impacts purchasing decisions.

Risk management 
Disclose how the organization identifies, assesses and manages climate-related risks. 
Recommended disclosure: a. Describe the organization’s processes for identifying and 
assessing climate-related risks.
Besi’s ESG strategy is influenced by important global trends currently such as climate 
change, natural resource conservation, pollution and the circular economy as well as 
human challenges such as diversity, human rights and the recruitment of qualified 
technical personnel. We have internal control and risk management systems in place 
designed to address and help identify and limit climate-related risk factors as well as 
other ESG and non-financial risks that could affect both our strategy and business 
operations. Short- and long-term topics are assessed through measures such as materiality 
analyses, key performance indicators for Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, water usage and 
waste disposal, customer and employee satisfaction metrics, supplier audits and 
continuous stakeholder dialogue. 
Besi’s ESG and non-financial risks are governed by a set of guidelines and instructions 
including: 
• ESG Policy
• RBA Supplier Certification 
• Conflict Minerals Policy 
• Code of Conduct 
• Supply Chain Policy 
• Supplier Code of Conduct 
• Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officer 
• Whistleblower procedure 
• Guidelines regarding authorizations
Besi regularly evaluates ESG topics deemed important to the conduct of its operations and 
the development of its corporate culture. We periodically reassess our societal and 
environmental impact in consideration of stakeholders’ concerns and adjust the ranking of 
high and medium assessment priorities. In 2022, we engaged a third-party consultant to 
conduct scenario analyses in order to identify potential risks and opportunities relevant to 
Besi. 
Recommended disclosure: b. Describe the organization’s processes for managing climate-
related risks.
The Board of Management is responsible for the management of internal and external 
risks associated with Besi’s business activities and to guarantee compliance with 
applicable legislation and regulations. The Board of Management is also responsible for 
the monitoring and reporting of such identified risks and leading the response across the 
organization to address any new risks which may arise. In addition, initiatives have been 
established for any specific climate change risks identified that are considered material 
per facility. As a result, targets have been set so that management can track climaterelated 
KPIs and report progress to the Supervisory Board. 
Please refer to the ‘Risk Management’ Section on page 82 of the Annual Report 2023 for 
more detail on Besi’s internal control and risk management systems to manage and 
mitigate climate-related and other ESG related risks.
Recommended disclosure: c. Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and 
managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organization’s overall risk 
management.
Besi’s risk management program seeks to identify and control potential risks and events 
which may affect our strategy, continuity, business and performance. We have identified 
the following climate-related risks considered to have significant relevance: 
• Besi may be materially and adversely affected by the impact of climate change including 
laws and regulations implemented in response to climate change related issues. 
• Asian production and personnel expansion could expose us to additional risks related to 
corruption and human rights issues in the region. 
• Recent regulations and increased customer focus on the usage of conflict minerals in 
product supply chains may force us to incur additional expenses, make our supply chain 
more complex and result in damage to Besi’s customer reputation.
