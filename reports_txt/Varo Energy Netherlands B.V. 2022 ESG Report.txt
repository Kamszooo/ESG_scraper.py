Energy security under threat
The	conflict	in	Ukraine	is	a	tragic	reminder	of	
the importance of global energy security. The 
knock-on effects have reverberated around 
the world, with profound consequences. 
After years of under-investment in 
conventional energies, weak investment in 
sustainable energies, and a lack of energy 
supply	diversification,	energy	security	is	
now a top priority in Europe. We face the 
short-term challenge of stabilisation and 
the long-term challenge of transformation 
as the world seeks secure, affordable and 
sustainable energy. 
Throughout 2022, our teams worked 
tirelessly to maintain energy supplies to our 
customers. VARO’s priority has been to 
continue to supply Europe with energy, while 
also investing in low-carbon energy that 
creates decarbonisation solutions to meet 
changing customer needs.
I strongly believe that we must innovate, 
invest and diversify to bring sustainable 
energy solutions at scale to the market. This 
is the most impactful antidote to mitigate 
the global challenges we face. The energy 
transition may lose public support and 
momentum if we fail to ensure secure energy 
that is both accessible and affordable. This 
belief is at the very essence of our purpose 
– to accelerate the transition to a world of 
reliable, accessible and sustainable energy – 
and of our twin-engine business strategy.
 
VARO’s strategy to promote 
the transition
VARO is well positioned to play a major 
role in the sustainable energy transition 
and we are transforming from being a 
supplier to becoming the energy transition 
partner of choice by helping our customers 
achieve their own transformation. 
The energy crisis has underlined the 
relevance of VARO’s business model. 
We announced our ONE VARO 
Transformation strategy in July 2022. 
At the core of our strategy are our 
‘twin-engines’ for conventional and 
sustainable energies, which will enable 
us to ensure energy security for our 
customers while decarbonising their 
energy use at pace. Engine 1, our 
conventional energies business, is about 
ensuring energy security today while 
continuing	to	drive	reliability,	efficiency, 	
decarbonisation and repurposing. Engine 
2, our sustainable energies businesses, 
has	five	strategic	growth	pillars	that	we 	
believe offer the most attractive low-
carbon growth opportunities, which play 
to our strengths and create a sustainable 
energy	portfolio	that	is	fit	for	the	evolving 	
needs of our customers. To scale at 
pace,	we	plan	to	invest	USD	3.5	billion 	
between 2022 and 2026, with two thirds 
committed to sustainable energies. We 
will decarbonise our current conventional 
asset infrastructure and convert it into 
sustainable manufacturing and distribution 
Letter from the CEO 
2022 was an unprecedented year for the energy 
industry, with extraordinary macro and geopolitical 
challenges. It was also a transformational year for VARO 
–	we	delivered	significant	operational	and	business 	
milestones, functionalised our organisation, brought in 
talented people with new capabilities to complement our 
already outstanding teams, announced our ONE VARO

hubs over time. This represents a ‘just 
transition’ as we intend to transform our 
existing infrastructure and capabilities for 
the future. 
Achieving our commitments 
We	are	undertaking	a	significant	
transformation and want to ensure we 
do it the right way. Our talented team is 
excited about the future possibilities that 
this energy transition brings – particularly 
as we build on our great progress in 2022. 
Environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) commitments are a fundamental part 
of our ONE VARO Transformation strategy. 
We	have	defined	our	baseline	figures	and	
are enhancing the transparency of our 
reporting, with actions and milestones to 
decarbonise our company. Our ambitions 
are centred around a bold and industry-
leading target to achieve net-zero emissions 
by 2040, which lies at the core of our 
sustainability agenda. We aim to reduce our 
scope 1 and 2 emissions by 40% by 2030 
and our scope 3 carbon intensity by 15% by 
2030 compared to 2022. 
We are committed to using more than 
two-thirds of renewable electricity in our 
operations by the end of 2023 and made 
some good progress with 100% renewable 
electricity sourced for our operations 
in Cressier in 2022. We announced the 
installation of the largest ground-mounted 
solar farm in Switzerland in Cressier during 
2023 to generate renewable electricity. We 
have	also	made	progress	with	our	125 MW	
electrolyser project to produce green 
hydrogen at our Bayernoil manufacturing hub. 
ESG is now being integrated into all our 
decision-making processes. For example, 
we have introduced internal carbon pricing, 
and integrated ESG and CO 2 target impacts 
in all our M&A and business development 
decisions. As we transform and invest in 
new sustainable energies, it is vital that we 
create high standards of accountability, and 
during 2022 we established a new ESG 
governance framework, including an ESG 
committee at the Executive Board level. 
Prioritising safety 
Safety is a key priority at VARO. We are 
committed to ensuring everybody returns 
home safely to their families and loved 
ones every day – both physically and 
mentally. We continuously reinforce a 
safety culture throughout the organisation 
to prevent accidents at our sites and 
offices.	Safety	is	a	long	journey	that 	
requires continuous improvement and 
sustained dedication. During 2022, we 
initiated a multi-year and company-
wide plan to systematically improve 
Health, Safety, Security and Environment 
performance through our Operations 
Excellence Management System and 
to avoid potentially serious injuries and 
incidents.
People with world-class expertise
To lead our business into the future, 
we need people with world-class 
expertise, proven track records and 
diversity of thought. The energy system 
must transform and diversify. This is a 
complex task that requires partnerships, 
collaboration, new skills and infrastructure, 
as well as the ability to navigate market 
complexity, including changing regulations. 
Our people and culture, both guided by 
our values to embrace challenge, aim 
high, drive pace and solve together, will 
be essential for our continued success. I 
was delighted to welcome industry-leading 
talent to VARO in 2022, which further 
enhanced our existing teams. Together, we 
will accelerate our transformation. 
To name a few, we were pleased to 
welcome: Fatemeh Rezazadeh, VP 
Hydrogen; Christian Cuenot, VP Biogas; 
Irene Franck, HR Director; Jens Bruno, 
ESG Director; Jessica Kangeli, Corporate 
Finance Director; and Jason Wood, 
Engineering and Project Director.
As we grow in different geographies and 
businesses, ensuring we promote positive 
working environments is vital. We are 
committed to providing equal opportunities 
for our diverse workforce.  
As part of our Equity, Inclusion and 
Diversity Policy, we have set new targets 
to increase female representation as we 
continue to increase diversity. In 2022, the 
representation of women in VARO’s senior 
leadership team increased from 14% to 16% 
and by June of this year to 18%. We still 
have more work to do, but I am convinced 
that we are heading in the right direction.
Leading the energy transition
VARO has the clear ambition to be a 
leader in providing sustainable energy 
solutions and I believe that our culture 
and capabilities are the key ingredients 
to ensure we accelerate the energy 
transition. Over the coming year, we will 
further embed ESG into our organisation 
and focus on growing our business in line 
with our ESG targets. We will do this by 
relentlessly working on creating a safe 
working environment, decarbonising our 
business, diversifying our workforce and 
developing a quality supply chain. We face 
profound challenges in the energy system 
but I believe VARO has both the ambition 
and capabilities to drive our transformation 
for our people, customers and partners – 
as well as society at large.

Energy security, supply and 
affordability
VARO’s priority in 2022 was to maintain 
energy supplies in Europe. But the world 
needs new and more diverse forms of 
energy to mitigate climate change and 
meet changing customer needs. 
After years of under-investment in 
conventional energies and a lack of 
investment in sustainable energies – global 
primary energy capex fell 40% over the 
past	decade	from	USD	1.3	trillion	in	2014 	
to	USD	0.8	trillion	in	2021	–	the	Ukraine 	
war sparked further supply disruption. 
Today’s energy markets face a complex 
interplay of soaring energy prices and 
unreliable energy. This has made energy 
security, affordability and sustainability 
top priorities in Europe. The market 
environment has highlighted the need 
for diverse forms of energy and multiple 
suppliers to avoid demand and supply 
asymmetry. 
The importance of energy in 
reducing carbon emissions
Throughout 2022, the impact of global 
climate change was evident from 
flooding	in	Asia	and 	droughts	in	Africa, 	
to	heatwaves	and	wildfires	in	Europe	and 	
North America. Greenhouse gas emissions 
have risen again to record levels following 
the COVID-19 pandemic. Keeping the 
global temperature rise to below 1.5°C 
now requires a fall in emissions every year 
of the same magnitude as the pandemic 
brought about. 
To reduce energy emissions, we need 
an orderly transition. We are committed 
to both ensuring energy security and 
accelerating this transition. 
VARO in a transitioning 
energy market
Over the past year, the world has learnt that energy security cannot 
be taken for granted, and that the energy transition and energy 
security need to combine to create a more sustainable future. 
Ensuring a ‘just transition’
The energy transition is one of the most 
ambitious endeavours of our time. The 
need to provide credible, affordable and 
reliable energy source alternatives has 
never been greater. But we understand 
that transitions are often disruptive, and 
the shift towards cleaner, more affordable 
and more sustainable energy sources can 
have	significant	impacts	on	our	employees, 	
communities and stakeholders. Our focus 
extends beyond reducing carbon emissions 
as we strive to ensure that this transition 
is fair, inclusive and equitable for all – to 
achieve a just transition. 
 
We are dedicated to supporting our 
employees through reskilling and upskilling 
programmes, ensuring that they can 
thrive in the evolving energy landscape. 
Promoting large-scale investment requires 
long-term and predictable policy and 
attractive	financing	solutions.	We	need	to 	
work together with policymakers to ensure 
regulation that develops at pace and 
supports new energies in a sustainable and 
cost-efficient	manner.	We	are	convinced 	
that repurposing our assets, including 
converting them to be able to co-process 
renewable feedstock, is the right approach 
to create value for both VARO and society. 
And we will engage with local communities 
to understand their needs and aspirations 
by working collaboratively to create new 
opportunities and mitigate any adverse 
effects of this transition. 
What the energy transition  
means for VARO
The transformation of the energy 
industry presents opportunities for 
VARO. We are accelerating the energy 
transition and empowering companies 
to achieve net-zero emissions by 
improving access to sustainable liquid 
biofuels, biomethane, green hydrogen, 
EV charging solutions and carbon 
removals.
We are committed to providing energy 
security, affordability and accelerating 
the transition. Our industry-leading 
net-zero target not only drives the 
ambitions for our operations, but also 
our commitment to supporting our 
customers to decarbonise. 
Our ambitious ONE VARO 
Transformation strategy is using the 
opportunities of the energy transition 
to create value, and is based on 
protecting and promoting people, 
our values, our operations and our 
customer’s energy needs. Only by 
investing, innovating and diversifying 
will	we	find	sustainable	energy	
solutions to tackle global challenges – 
by developing new business models, 
policies, skills and approaches. With 
our track record of building new 
businesses and customer solutions, 
executed by an entrepreneurial team, 
VARO is perfectly poised to be a 
leader in the transition.

Sourcing 
We use multiple feedstocks (such as 
crude oil, natural gas, bio-feedstock 
and waste streams) and we constantly 
analyse new sustainable solutions to add 
to our portfolio. This involves sourcing 
low-value waste and residue streams. 
 
Production 
We manufacture different energies throughout 
Europe. VARO is an experienced, safe and reliable 
operator, well respected by local communities 
and regulators. Our Cressier manufacturing hub is 
the only fuel manufacturing facility in Switzerland. 
We also own a 51.4% share in the Bayernoil 
manufacturing hub in Germany. These two 
manufacturing hubs have a joint capacity of around 
176,000 barrels per day. Through our acquisition of 
Bio Energy Coevorden BV (BEC) in the Netherlands, 
we are developing the largest biogas manufacturing 
facility in Northern Europe – doubling the facility’s 
capacity from 300 GWh to 650 GWh by 2026. Our 
manufacturing asset base will grow and process 
new types of feedstock as we invest in sustainable 
energies.
 
Transportation and storage 
A	reliable	and	efficient	logistics	network	is	key	to 	
delivering energy to our customers. Besides pipeline 
transportation, VARO’s major logistics channels are rail, 
river and marine transportation and, to a lesser extent, 
heavy-duty vehicle transportation.
Distribution and services 
VARO serves a large network of business-to-business 
customers, retail customers and consumers across 
Europe. In addition to our own production, we buy and 
sell energy products from third parties to meet customer 
demand. We also partner with existing and potential 
customers (such as in aviation, industry, food retail and 
wholesale) to co-develop energy solutions that meet their 
decarbonisation needs.

biofuels with conventional fuels. We 
have deep expertise with biofuels and 
bio-feedstock sourcing, blending and 
marketing.
We have pioneered the introduction of 
biofuels	in	our	markets.	VARO	was	the	first	
company to introduce the material quantity 
of advanced bioethanol in Switzerland. In 
2015, we invested in blending facilities to 
blend bioethanol (from waste) into gasoline 
and introduced the E5 grade. In 2016, 
we added biodiesel blending facilities to 
produce B7.
Our biofuels scale-up plan
• Minimise	the	use	of	first	generation	(1G)	biofuels	from	food,	feed	and 	
crop-based feedstocks.
• Build manufacturing assets to produce advanced 2G biofuels from 
waste and advanced feedstocks (Annex IX A and B of the RED 
regulations), notably SAF and Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO).

roadmap to decarbonise our operations 
and aim to reduce our GHG emissions 
(scopes 1 and 2) by 40%, compared to our 
2022 baseline by 2030. We are working 
to achieve this by implementing a range 
of	initiatives,	including	energy	efficiency	
measures and using renewable electricity. 
Switching from grey to green hydrogen 
is another measure to reduce our carbon 
footprint. Building on our decarbonisation 
roadmap, we will work towards achieving 
our targets. 
Health and safety in our operations is 
a priority and an essential part of our 
manufacturing strategy. Working in 
line with best practice means that we 
operate in a way that protects our people 
and the environment, while respecting 
our neighbours. We recognise that the 
well-being and safety of our employees, 
contractors, and surrounding local 
communities, are fundamental to our 
operations.
 Our customers 
We are committed to delivering reliable, 
accessible and sustainable energy solutions 
that align with our customer’s requirements 
while contributing to a more sustainable 
future. We promote the global energy 
transition by actively working with our 
customers to decarbonise their operations. 
As part of the ONE VARO Transformation 
strategy, we are actively building our 
sustainable energies business, and 
investing and partnering to accelerate the 
energy transition. We collaborate closely 
with our customers to build a diverse 
and resilient portfolio of sustainable 
energies and solutions that will facilitate 
the transition to a low-carbon society. 
We expand our sustainable energies 
portfolio through strategic investments 
and partnerships, and champion innovative 
solutions that drive the shift to clean and 
sustainable energy sources. 
Overall, our target is to reduce the carbon 
intensity of the products we sell by 15% by 
2030, while supporting our customers in 
their decarbonisation journey. As we focus 
on delivering tangible progress during this 
pivotal decade, our ambition is to achieve 
net-zero emissions across our value  
chain by 2040. 
  Our people
We value our employees as the driving 
force behind our success, and we are 
dedicated to their well-being, growth 
and development. Our ESG strategy 
encompasses a strong focus on our 
people – to ensure a diverse and inclusive 
workplace where everyone is respected, 
supported and offered equal opportunities. 
We invest in training and development 
programmes to enhance their skills 
and capabilities to foster a culture of 
continuous learning and professional 
growth. By prioritising the well-being and 
satisfaction of our employees, we strive to 
create a collaborative and high-performing 
workforce.
Diversity is a fundamental driver of our 
transformation	agenda	as	we	firmly 	
believe that a diverse workforce brings a 
variety of perspectives, experiences and 
ideas that are essential for innovation 
and growth. Embracing diversity in all its 
forms – including gender, ethnicity, age 
and background – creates an inclusive 
environment where every individual feels 
valued, respected and empowered to 
contribute with their unique strengths.

By fostering diversity and non-
discrimination, we tap into a rich pool of 
talent to unlock a wide range of insights 
and creative solutions that enable us 
to tackle complex challenges and drive 
meaningful change. Moreover, diversity 
enhances our ability to connect with a 
diverse customer base, understand their 
needs, and deliver products and services 
that cater to their diverse preferences. We 
recognise that building a diverse workforce 
and an inclusive culture is not only the 
right thing to do, but is also a strategic 
imperative that drives our transformation 
agenda forward – to position us for long-
term success in an ever-evolving global 
landscape.
  Our responsibility
Our	ESG	strategy	reflects	our	commitment 	
to responsible and ethical practices. We 
believe in transparent and accountable 
governance, and align our decision-making 
processes with sustainable principles.  
To further reinforce our commitment, 
we have implemented measures to link 
executive pay to our ESG performance, 
which ensures alignment between our 
values and our actions. 
We	take	a	firm	stance	to	ensure	that	we 	
and our partners operate in full compliance 
with all laws and regulations. Measures 
to promote anti-corruption and anti-
competitive behaviour are integral parts of 
our way of working.
The energy transition involves a large-scale 
societal transformation. To support this 
process at the pace needed to combat 
climate change, we need new public 
policy and technologies. We want to be a 
positive force in this respect and engage 
in dialogue and advocacy to create the 
frameworks that accelerate the transition. 
We aim to contribute positively to the local 
societies we impact. In doing so, we aim 
for open dialogue with our stakeholders 
to ensure we understand how we impact 
them and their expectations. 
We understand that our impact and 
responsibility extends into society and 
our value chain. For example, we work to 
ensure that decarbonising our feedstocks 
does not cause negative impact on other 
ESG topics, and that we focus on waste-
based renewable feedstocks.
CASE STUDY
Carbon pricing to reduce our emissions
We have implemented an internal carbon pricing for our scope 1 and 2 
emissions. Carbon pricing is included in business case evaluation for our M&A 
and business development projects as of 2023.
Scope 1 emissions  (tCO2) are to be calculated for all projects as part of their 
investment case. Financial scope 1 impact will be priced with a centrally agreed 
carbon price. 
For scope 2 emissions , the cost is calculated as the anticipated cost of 
acquiring renewable electricity to avoid an increase in scope 2 emissions.

Reducing our emissions – 
how we will get there
We have set ambitious ESG targets.  
Our main driver is our push to achieve  
net-zero emissions by 2040 in scopes 1, 2 
and 3, with intermediate milestones.
Scope 1 and 2 target

How we will do it:  
Leverage our ONE VARO Transformation 
strategy and decarbonisation efforts. This 
means further repurposing our manufacturing 
hubs, and providing future-proof sustainable 
energy solutions tailored to the future needs 
of customers – to drive strong growth in 
our sustainable energies product portfolio. 
We will continue decarbonisation projects 
to drive absolute emission reductions in 
our manufacturing and supply chain. Any 
remaining impact will be neutralised through 
internal or external CO2 removal projects.
The VARO net-zero pathway (illustrative) builds on clear targets for absolute reductions in our scope 1 and 
2 emissions – combined with the scale up of our low-carbon offerings and the repurposing of our assets for 
conventional fuels. Carbon removals will be used to offset any remaining emissions to achieve net-zero emissions.

Scope 3 target  
15% reduction in scope 3 greenhouse gas 
emissions (GHG) intensity by 2030 (vs. 
2022). We define GHG intensity as the CO2 
emitted over our value chain in relation 
to the amount of energy we put on the 
market. It is measured as gCO2e/MJ.
How we will do it:
Ensure security of supply while supporting 
customers during the energy transition 
towards sustainable energy solutions by 
growing our portfolio of biofuels, biomethane, 
bio-LNG, hydrogen, high-quality nature-based 
carbon removals and e-mobility solutions.
How we will do it:  
Implement	clearly	defined	decarbonisation	
initiatives in our manufacturing hubs, including 
energy conservation measures, sourcing and 
producing green electricity, and replacing 
grey hydrogen with green and waste-based 
biogenic hydrogen.

Our work in 2023 and beyond
We continuously engage with our 
stakeholders to ensure our ESG strategy 
and targets are relevant. In upcoming 
materiality assessments, we will we 
will implement the concept of ‘double 
materiality’ to align with the latest 
reporting standards, including the 
mandatory ESG reporting requirements 
under	the	EU	Corporate	Sustainability 	
Reporting Directive (CSRD). We will 
assess the materiality of the sustainability 
topics related to our industry from two 
perspectives:
1. Financial materiality – impact 
assessment of ESG topics in terms of 
economic value creation for VARO for the 
benefit	of	investors	(shareholders).
2. Impact materiality  – the economic, 
environmental and social assessment of 
VARO’s impacts throughout the value chain 
for	the	benefit	of	multiple	stakeholders, 	
such as investors, employees, customers, 
suppliers and local communities.
Our materiality assessment process
We conducted our materiality assessment with senior management, employees, 
stakeholders and our shareholders, representing our Supervisory Board, to analyse 
the most relevant topics for the energy industry and our value chain.
We consolidated the results from 21 
stakeholders interviews and 358 employee 
survey responses to assign a weight to each 
of our 23 material topics. 
We then mapped material topics on a 
matrix with two axes:
• importance for stakeholders
• economic, environmental and social 
impact
Our senior management team used the 
results of the materiality matrix to inform our 
ESG strategy, which focuses on managing 
the performance of and reducing negative 
impacts related to these material topics, as 
well	as	amplifying	their	positive	benefits.	
At the top right of our materiality matrix are 
our most material topics:
• health and safety
• sustainable energies
• GHG emissions
• employee satisfaction and development
• sustainability reporting
• energy	efficiency	of	operations
• equity, diversion and inclusion

Mitigating our 
environmental impacts
We strive to continuously improve 
environmental performance throughout 
our operations and value chain, while 
ensuring open communication on 
environmental topics with all stakeholders. 
Our operational environmental risks relate 
to emissions, potential spills, water and 
energy use, waste generation and land use, 
as well as transportation via pipelines, sea, 
road and rail. We proactively assess and 
mitigate environmental risks, drive energy 
efficiency	measures,	promote	the	use	of 	
renewable energy, and protect and support 
biodiversity through various initiatives. 
Environmental management is an integral 
part of our HSSE work.
We work proactively to mitigate the environmental impacts 
of our operations by reducing emissions, avoiding spills, 
protecting	biodiversity,	and	minimising	waste	and	effluents.	
Minimising the impact of the energy our customers need is 
also central to our ONE VARO Transformation strategy.
Our manufacturing hubs have 
comprehensive processes to assess, 
minimise and report on environmental 
impacts. Regular Environmental Impact 
Assessments (EIAs) or similar assessments 
are conducted that focus on emissions to 
air, water and land, waste, noise pollution, 
energy and water use, odours, and 
potential impacts from incidents.
Our scope 3 emissions represent 98% 
of our overall value chain emissions. 
By	developing	our	five	strategic	growth 	
pillars, we are helping our customers to 
decarbonise, while decreasing our overall 
scope 3 carbon intensity.

Developing more 
sustainable products
We are increasingly offering more sustainable products 
and energy solutions to help customers lower their 
environmental impact and decarbonise. 
Our targets Our progress in 2022
• CAPEX	investments	of	USD	3.5	billion	
between 2022 and 2026 – including over 
two-thirds invested in sustainable energy 
solutions.
• VARO’s sold products had a carbon 
intensity of 83 gCO 2/MJ, which 
equates to a 5% reduction compared 
to our 2020 baseline  
of 87 gCO2/MJ.   
• A 15% reduction in the carbon intensity 
of our sold products by 2030 (helping our 
customers to annually avoid more than 5 
million tonnes of emissions), compared 
with 2022.
• Net-zero emissions from our  
products by 2040.
Our approach
Our ONE VARO Transformation ‘twin-
engine’ strategy seeks to invest the cash 
flows	generated	by	our	conventional 	
energies business (Engine 1) into our 
sustainable energies business (Engine 2). 
In so doing, we aim to create a diverse 
portfolio of sustainable, accessible and 
reliable energy solutions.
We are taking a phased and disciplined 
approach to our investments, driven by 
customer needs. This will involve creating 
the energy system of the future by 
repurposing and building new infrastructure 
at scale and by forging new partnerships to 
drive decarbonisation.
In July 2022, we launched our ‘twin engine’ 
ONE VARO Transformation strategy to 
develop a wide range of sustainable energy 
solutions.  
While the emissions generated from the 
use of our products represented 83% of 
our scope 3 emissions in 2022, we are 
increasing our offering of sustainable 
energy	solutions	in	Europe	and	significantly	
reducing our carbon intensity. 
Our ONE VARO Transformation 
strategy includes an ambitious 
plan to accelerate growth 
in our sustainable energies 
business	by	focusing	on	five 	
key strategic growth pillars: 
• Biofuels
• Biomethane and bio-LNG 
 (liquefied natural gas)
• Hydrogen
• e-mobility
• Carbon removals

Biofuels
We aim to become an integrated producer 
of second generation (2G) advanced 
biofuels, which are produced from 
waste and advanced feedstocks, such 
as Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) and 
HVO. We are building new renewable 
manufacturing facilities as well as 
repurposing older assets and developing 
long-term partnerships to secure advanced 
feedstocks. We produce biofuels through 
tolling agreements for bio feedstock at 
third-party producer locations.
Our blended renewable fuels are supplied 
from our network of inland truck-loading 
racks that offers products with a higher 
proportion of biofuels (typically B20, B30 
and B100). With increasing mandates for 
renewable fuel content, HVO will remain an 
important (drop-in) biodiesel.
Switzerland has established strict ecological and social 
requirements on imported biogenic components. Biofuels 
obtained from waste, and residues from agriculture, forestry, 
and restoration (deep-frying oil), automatically qualify as tax-
free when blended with conventional fuel. Other fuels must be 
proven to have an acceptable environmental and social impact 
throughout the entire value chain – from feedstock collection 
to segregation, transportation, production and storage. 
Mixing various types of bio-components is prohibited. This 
means that all stages of the value chain must be completely 
segregated and traceable. VARO has implemented a system 
of controls to ensure compliance with all the environmental 
and social criteria established in Article 12b of the Mineral Oil 
Tax Law. 
Furthermore, companies that blend biofuels, and suppliers 
that import bio-components from abroad, must have a special 
licence. All of our bio-component suppliers hold BTCert, 
which means they undergo regular auditing to achieve 
maximum security and compliance with the approval criteria. 
Even	for	certified	suppliers,	VARO	conducts	random	checks 	
on compliance with the licence criteria. This helps us avoid 
running the risk of a supplier’s licence being revoked in the 
event of a licence breach on their side.

Page 28:
We work to ensure that all the biofuels we 
source from trading companies and biofuel 
producers are fully compliant with all 
relevant	local	(EU	or	national)	regulations. 	
We realise the importance of the impact 
that feedstock type and quality can have 
on the transition to clean energy.
Since the adoption of the Renewable 
Energy Directive (RED), the transition 
to biofuels has been considered an 
important	element	of	EU	policy	on 	
transport decarbonisation. Biofuels 
represent a major source of renewable 
energy, and they play an important role 
in	the	realisation	of	the	UN	Sustainable 	
Development Goals, particularly in the 
context of energy security and climate 
change. The production of sustainable 
biofuels can also promote health, 
employment, economic growth, rural 
development, soil management and water 
quality. 
VARO purchases ethanol, FAME (Fatty 
Acid Methyl Ester, fettsyrametylestrar), 
HVO, ETBE (Ethyl Tertiary Butyl Ether) and 
Responsible sourcing 
of feedstock
bio-naphtha products from a wide variety 
of	producers	that	are	certified	under	one	of 	
the	voluntary	certification	schemes.	Most 	
producers we source biofuel products from 
are International Sustainability and Carbon 
Certification 	(ISCC)-certified, 	while	others	
are	certified	through	the	Roundtable	on 	
Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), RedCert-
EU	or	2BSVS.	These	certifications	for 	
biofuel producers involve regular audits 
for	re-certification	to	verify	their	ongoing 	
compliance. 
About 40% of the total volume of our 
biofuels are waste-based, and about 60% 
is	certified	crop-based.	We	are	committed 	
to gradually minimising the use of crop-
based biofuels and are focusing on 
promoting advanced biofuels and other 
low-carbon fuels.

Our approach
Biomethane and bio-LNG
Our ambition is to be a leading producer 
of biomethane and bio-LNG, which can 
help customers to reduce their emissions 
by over 90% while also promoting energy 
security. We are developing a product 
portfolio through selected acquisitions 
and industrial-scale projects that draw 
on our production and construction 
expertise and capabilities. We are also 
developing our customer relationships in 
our fuels business and our expertise in bio-
feedstock sourcing. 
Hydrogen
We are building on our position as a 
significant	hydrogen	consumer	with	
expertise in H 2-handling to develop 
hydrogen production hubs. We expect 
additional green and biogenic production to 
lead to offtake opportunities for industry, 
heavy transport and synthetic fuels. Our 
plan involves a phased approach with an 
initial investment in a 125 MW electrolyser 
at the Bayernoil manufacturing hub. 
e-mobility
We	aim	to	become	a	significant	player	in 	
the Electric Vehicle (EV) ecosystem by 
offering a comprehensive charging solution 
that provides customers with a supply 
of low-carbon energy. We have a strong 
emphasis	on	commercial	fleet	clients	in	our 	
primary countries and are actively seeking 
partnerships and acquisitions to expand 
our presence in less-developed markets. 
Carbon removals
With expertise in carbon, forestry and 
agro-forestry markets, SilviCarbon selects 
and participates in scalable afforestation, 
reforestation and regenerative farming 
projects that provide tangible long-
term	economic	and	social	benefits.	By 	
leveraging VARO’s trading and marketing 
capabilities, this provides carbon removal 
credits and an integrated energy offering 
to customers to meet their net-zero climate 
targets.
Through SilviCarbon, we own 35,000 
hectares of degraded land at an existing 
plantation in Laos that will be used for 
future afforestation projects. The site has 
the potential to sequester approximately 
five	million	tonnes	of	CO 2 from the 
atmosphere.

are generated by projects that 
reduce GHG emissions in upstream

biomass). About 16% of our bio-gasoline 
was ETBE, made from bio-ethanol and 
isobutylene and improves the combustion 
characteristics of gasoline. 
The majority (88%) of our biodiesel was 
FAME, about half of which originated from 
waste-based feedstock (which falls under 
Annex	IX	part	A	&	B	published	in	the	EU 	
RED). This resulted in a greenhouse gas 
emissions saving of 86% or higher, which 
equated to 13 gCO 2/MJ. The other half of 
our FAME volume was derived from crop-
based feedstocks, such as oil crops, which 
equated to about 33g CO 2/MJ. 
HVO (hydrogenated vegetable oil), which 
represents 12% of the total volume of 
biodiesel that we offer in Europe, originates 
from a mixture of crop-based and waste-
based products.
Biomethane and bio-LNG
In December 2022, we signed an 
agreement to acquire 80% of Bio Energy 
Coevorden BV (BEC) in the Netherlands, 
one of the largest biogas manufacturers 
in Europe. We plan to develop the 
largest biogas manufacturing facility in 
Northern Europe by doubling the current 
facility capacity from 300 GWh to 650 
GWh by 2026. The acquisition will have 
a substantial contribution of 20-25% of 
VARO’s Engine 2 (renewable energies) 
EBITDA by 2026. Read more in the Case 
Study on page 38 .
As part of our biodiesel offering, we also 
supplied 65 km 3 of HVO, which originates 
from a mixture of crop and waste-based 
feedstocks.
Hydrogen
During	2022,	we	identified	e-fuels 	
as an important product to offer our 
customers and help them to achieve their 
decarbonisation targets. We are exploring 
and evaluating suitable partnership 
opportunities, including offtakes and  
co-investment in production and marketing 
in advantageous locations. 
e-mobility
In 2022, our initial investment in E-Flux 
proved invaluable in creating a foothold 
in	the	e-mobility	sector	and	our	E-flux 	
business continued to grow in the 
Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.
Carbon removals
In 2022, SilviCarbon continued to provide 
advisory services to plantation owners in 
Laos and Paraguay. 
SilviCarbon is currently involved in eight 
projects, which provide the company with 
rights of approximately 10 million tonnes of 
CO2e removals over their lifetime. We have 
also continued to make good progress at 
our plantation in Laos. Our new plantation 
nursery is building on our recent research 
that	will	contribute	to	significantly	greater	
growth rates at the plantation.

Our work in 2023 and beyond
Biofuels
In 2023, we signed a Memorandum of 
Understanding 	with	the	Lufthansa	Group	
to explore the production and supply of 
Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). See the 
Case Study on page 45 .
We will continue our work to source and 
develop advanced feedstock streams, as 
well as explore investment opportunities 
to acquire and develop additional biofuel 
manufacturing capacity. By 2026, we aim 
to produce at least 250,000 tonnes of 
advanced biofuels.
Biomethane and bio-LNG
In 2023, we will continue to work with BEC 
(read more in the Case Study on page 38 ), 
and plan to increase capacity to 650 GWh.
We are investigating additional acquisitions 
and projects to develop our integrated 
value chain – from advanced feedstock 
sourcing to providing customer products. 
By 2026, we plan to produce 1 TWh of 
biomethane / bio-LNG.
Feedstock from waste streams and 
manure have the potential to reduce our 
annual scope 3 emissions by 220,000 
tonnes, compared with fossil natural 
gas. Our investments will also support 
the circular economy and create new 
employment opportunities.
Hydrogen
In 2023, we will continue to develop our 
125	MW	electrolyser	and	will	make	a	final 	
investment decision by Q3 2023. We are 
also exploring other hydrogen production 
options related to our manufacturing hubs 
and SAF project.
Our long-term goal is to serve industry, 
heavy transport, shipping and aviation with 
hydrogen and its derivatives. 
e-mobility
We will invest in partnerships focused 
on	commercial	fleet	charging,	project 	
development, and power supply 
optimisation to establish scalable solutions 
throughout the value chain and deliver an 
integrated charging offering. In 2023, we 
expect to have a comprehensive offering 
in place to help our current and new 
customers transition to e-mobility.
Carbon removals
We will develop and increase our carbon 
portfolio of high-quality removals while 
expanding our sourcing and trading 
activities. We will continue to invest in 
scaling up our plantation in Laos, as well as 
expanding the SilviCarbon team in South 
East Asia and Latin America.

Strategic partnership 
drives growth in 
advanced biofuels
VARO has signed a strategic offtake agreement with 
Fintoil	to	purchase	a	by-product	from	its	refinery	to	
produce advanced biofuels.
The agreement is to buy crude fatty acid, 
which can be used to produce second-
generation biofuels. The agreement covers 
a	significant	part	of	Fintoil’s	crude	fatty 	
acid	production	from	its	Hamina	biorefinery 	
in Finland. The raw material is a by-product 
of softwood pulp, crude tall oil (CTO), 
which	qualifies	as	an	advanced	biofuel 	
as	defined	by	the	European	Commission 	
as it does not compete for the resources 
with the food or feed chain. Fintoil is part-
owned by Taaleri.
“Taaleri and VARO have a similar strategy 
and common ambitions, and our intention 
is to develop and deepen our cooperation 
in several areas,” says Juhani Elomaa, 
Chairman of the Board of Taaleri Plc.
Partnering around a common 
sustainability ambition
“We are already a leading player in the 
marketing of biofuels and want to be a 
frontrunner in advanced biofuels,” says 
Marcel Andreessen, VP Biofuels at VARO. 
“Through our partnership with Fintoil/Taaleri 
we have secured advanced feedstock, 
which plays a critical role in minimising the 
use of food and feed. Biofuels will continue 
to play a key role in meeting the need of our 
customers to decarbonise as they progress 
in the energy transition while ensuring the 
reliability of supply.”
Fintoil’s	Hamina	biorefinery	became	
operational	in	Q3	2022.	The	biorefinery 	
has	an	annual	refining	capacity	of	200,000 	
tonnes of CTO feedstock. When fully 
operational,	the	Hamina	biorefinery	will	be	
the fourth largest of its kind in the world.

CO2 emissions
We are working towards a 40% reduction in our scope 1 
and 2 emissions by 2030. In 2022, we set our target to 
achieve net-zero CO2e emissions by 2040.
Our targets Our progress in 2022
Scope 1 and 2 emissions
•  40% absolute reduction in scope 1  
and 2 CO2e emissions by 2030  
compared with 2022.
• 	Defined	new	2022	baseline	for	our	CO2 
targets.
• 	Renewable	certificates	purchased	for	
100% of electricity use at the Cressier 
manufacturing hub and our terminals in 
Switzerland.
Scope 3 emissions
•  15% reduction in scope 3 intensity in 
marketed energy by 2030.
•  Saved 2.3 million tonnes CO2e 
emissions by enabling VARO 
customers to replace conventional fuels 
with renewable alternatives.
•  Finalised the acquisition of the biogas 
company Bio Energy Coevorden BV in 
January 2023, which made us a major 
European biogas producer.
Managing scope 1 and 2 CO2e
The majority of VARO’s scope 1 and 2 
greenhouse gas emissions are related to 
energy use and hydrogen production at 
our Cressier and Bayernoil manufacturing 
hubs. Mitigating these emissions is 
therefore essential in our work towards our 
2030 target to reduce our scope 1 and 2 
emissions by 40%. 
Emission reduction measures include 
energy	efficiency,	process	optimisation, 	
switching	to	green	hydrogen,	electrification 	
and sourcing renewable electricity. The 
co-processing of bio-feedstock and 
CO2 capture provide other promising 
opportunities for emission reduction. 
Planning for de-carbonisation
We are following an energy transition and de-
carbonisation masterplan towards our 2030 
scope 1 and 2 targets. Our decarbonisation 
plan provides the basis for technical project 
planning at our manufacturing hubs, as 
well as insights into how our emissions are 
expected to develop over time. It provides 
a feedback loop to ensure our planned 
investments support our CO2e reduction 
targets.

Page 34:
Progress in 2022
In 2022, our absolute scope 1 and 2 
emissions amounted to 1.4 million tonnes 
of CO2e, which was a 22% increase 
compared to the previous year. Volumes 
produced in 2021 were relatively low due 
to the economic impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic. A planned maintenance stop 
at our Cressier manufacturing hub and 
production disruption at the Bayernoil 
manufacturing hub also contributed to 
lower volumes in 2021. 
During 2022, demand recovered following 
the pandemic and due to Russia’s invasion 
of	Ukraine,	which	created	an	energy	crisis 	
with shortages in European imports of 
conventional fuels. Supporting energy 
security in Europe was a major priority 
for VARO in 2022. We ensured high 
manufactured volumes and improved 
reliability	and	production	efficiency, 	
resulting in a 33% and 28% increase in 
throughput at Cressier and Bayernoil 
respectively. A state-sanctioned switch 
to the use of LPG to reduce natural 
gas dependency in our manufacturing 
processes in Germany also increased 
scope 1 emissions.  
Additionally, we updated our CO 2 
accounting methodology in 2022 to include 
the dual reporting of our scope 2 data. To 
align with our goal to source low-carbon 
electricity in our operations, our reporting 
includes a market-based approach. In 
2022, we saw a positive accounting effect 
in our Swiss operations from the purchase 
of renewable electricity. However, the 
accounting method generated higher 
scope 2 emissions in other markets 
compared to using factors based on 
national electricity grid averages. The 
combined effect of increased production

Emissions at the Cressier 
manufacturing hub
Our Cressier manufacturing hub is relatively 
energy	efficient,	due	to	a	limited	need	to	
cool and heat intermediate products. This 
reduces heat loss and additional energy 
requirements.
We have also implemented many energy 
efficiency	improvement	projects	over	
the past decade. We achieved a 6.6% 
energy	efficiency	improvement	in	2022	
compared with 2014 – nearing our target 
to	increase	energy	efficiency	by	6.8%	in	
2023. Operational measures and higher 
throughput	improved	the	energy	efficiency	
of manufacturing by over 10% compared to 
2021, measured as Solomon EII. 
 
During 2022, we focused on project pipeline 
planning to support the energy transition 
and our 2030 target of a 40% reduction in 
scope 1 and 2 emissions. Cressier and our 
Swiss terminals also sourced 100% of their 
electricity	through	renewable	certificates	in	
2022, which reduced our CO2e emissions by 
around 6,000 tonnes. 
Emissions at the Bayernoil 
manufacturing hub
2022 was a year of high production at 
Bayernoil and to ensure high process 
efficiency	and	energy	security	in 	our	
markets, a higher-than-normal proportion 
of the production capacity was used at the 
joint venture. Consequently, scope 1 CO 2e 
emissions allocated to VARO increased by 
24% compared to 2021. 
and the shift in accounting method resulted 
in a 10% increase in our scope 2 emissions 
compared to 2021. 
Overall, our manufacturing volumes 
increased at a faster rate than our scope 1 
and 2 emissions, which resulted in strong 
improvements in CO 2	efficiency	for	both 	
our manufacturing hubs.

Page 35:
In 2022, workers at the Bayernoil hub 
volunteered to act as ‘energy scouts’ as part 
of a new long-term programme. Employee 
engagement on identifying and energy 
saving initiatives increased substantially 
through improved dialogue on issues, ideas, 
the status of energy savings measures and 
decided actions.
Operational focus supported by the ‘energy 
scouts’, as well as good process reliability 
in the second half of the year, improved 
the	energy	efficiency	of	the	Bayernoil	
manufacturing hub by over 8% in 2022, 
measured as Solomon EII.
During 2022, we continued project pipeline 
planning to support the energy transition 
and our 2030 target to reduce scope 1 and 
2 emissions by 40%, and we are planning 
several high-impact projects. We are also 
planning to source renewable electricity 
covering 100% of VARO’s proportion of the 
Bayernoil joint venture in 2023.
Our 2022 emissions baseline
We have set 2022 as the baseline year 
to monitor our progress on our 2030 and 
2040 scope 1, 2 and 3 emission targets 
as part of the ONE VARO Transformation 
strategy.
However, the year was impacted by 
the European energy crisis caused by 
Russia’s	invasion	of	Ukraine.	Our 	scope	1	
and 2 emissions are also affected by the 
operations of our manufacturing hubs, 
including maintenance and unplanned stops. 
Providing a truly representative baseline 
for a business such as VARO’s will always 
be challenging and it is also necessary 
to monitor long-term developments and 
transition planning. 
Our work in 2023 and beyond
As part of our 2030 decarbonisation 
masterplan, Cressier developed a list of 
decarbonisation projects that could result 
in estimated annual savings of 100,000 
tonnes of CO2e by 2030. These initiatives 
include	electrification	measures,	such	as 	
replacing the large steam turbine that 
drives the recycle gas compressor of the 
catalystic reformer with an electric motor, 
and	hydrogen	recovery	for	use	in	refinery 	
processes.
We are constructing the largest ground-
mounted solar farm in Switzerland 
on an industrial site adjacent to the 
Cressier manufacturing hub. Almost 
19,000 photovoltaic panels will annually 
generate around 8.4 GWh, equivalent 
to the annual energy consumption of 
over 2,000 Swiss households. At peak 
performance, the panels will produce up to 
60% of the Cressier manufacturing hub’s 
total electricity load. The project is being 
developed in cooperation with Groupe E 
and the Swiss Research and Development 
Centre (CSEM). It will become operational 
in Q2 2023 and will avoid around 1,700 
tonnes of CO2 emissions each year.
We are developing district heating 
systems to use waste heat from industrial 
processes at our Cressier manufacturing 
hub to heat homes in the adjacent 
municipalities.	The	first	of	these	systems 	
will become operational in 2023 and will 
provide up to 5 MW of heat to the Cornaux 
and Cressier municipalities a year to avoid 
their annual CO 2e emissions by 3,900 
tonnes compared to using heating oil. 
The second network, which is planned for 
2024-2030, will supply 3,500 households 
and businesses in the Canton of Neuchâtel 
and annually avoid 12,000 tonnes of CO 2e 
a year.
A planned maintenance shutdown 
in January 2023 at the Cressier 
manufacturing hub included routine 
measures	to	improve	energy	efficiency, 	
such as the cleaning of heat exchangers, 
decoking of furnaces, and changing 
catalysts in different reactors.
At the Bayernoil manufacturing hub, we 
have	planned	energy	efficiency	projects 	
until 2025 that will save 10 MW of energy 
and avoid approximately 17,000 tonnes of 
CO2e per year. Additional initiatives with a 
combined energy saving potential of up to 
12 MWh, equivalent to annual savings of 
20,000 tonnes CO 2e are being investigated.
We continue to plan for a 125 MW 
electrolyser at Bayernoil to produce 
green hydrogen that will replace the grey 
hydrogen generated from natural gas. It 
is	estimated	that	the	first	phase	of	the 	
project will annually avoid 65,000 tonnes  
of CO2e emissions.
In setting the 2022 baseline, we 
have updated our GHG accounting 
practices:
• For scope 1 – expanded the 
emission consolidation approach 
of our Bayernoil joint venture 
manufacturing	hub	to	reflect	our 	
extended utilisation during 2022.
• For scope 2 – introduced ‘dual 
reporting’ split in market and 
location-based approaches for 
greater clarity and to support our 
decision to source low-carbon 
electricity. 
• For scope 3 – updated our 
calculations for category 1 scope 
3 emissions (sourced crude oil and 
renewable products and feedstock) 
and switched to a more precise 
quantification	of	upstream	crude 	
oil extraction and transportation. 
This will provide better precision 
compared to using generic factors 
and allows us to consider CO 2 in 
sourcing. 
• Category 11 scope 3 emissions , 
refined	the	use	of	emission	factors 	
for the use of our products by using 
readily available external databases.

Managing our scope 3 emissions
To achieve net-zero emissions in line with 
societal and regulatory demands to combat 
climate change, we will decarbonise our 
product portfolio and replace conventional 
energy with sustainable energy solutions. 
The customer use of our sold products 
and services generated 82% of our total 
value chain CO 2e emissions in 2022. It 
is therefore imperative we reduce the 
carbon intensity of our product and service 
portfolio in order to achieve our 2030 
carbon intensity target and our 2040 
net-zero target. To achieve net zero, it 
will be necessary to reduce the volume 
of conventional fuels volumes in ‘easy 
to abate’ sectors, such as fuels for road 
transport and heating. This is expected 
to go hand-in-hand with the societal 
development to combat climate change. 
External factors, such as technological and 
regulatory developments and customer 
preferences, will impact the pace of 
change in our product portfolio. Reducing 
conventional energies, while working 
towards our emission targets, will not 
help society unless alternatives are made 
available to the users of energy. This 
is why the ONE VARO Transformation 
strategy focuses on developing and 
promoting sustainable energy solutions. 
It	is	also	why	the	energy	efficiency	of	our 	
bundled service offering is an important 
complement to our absolute emission 
reduction targets. Read more on how 
we drive this in the Developing more 
sustainable products section on page 26 . 
Progress in 2022 
VARO’s total reported scope 3 emissions 
in 2022 increased by 11% compared with 
2021 and by 19% compared to 2020, 
mainly due to a 10% increase in sold 
products as economies recovered from the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
We continued to drive emission savings 
through the sale of low-carbon fuels during 
2022 and avoided 2.3 million tonnes of 
scope 3 CO2e emissions by enabling VARO 
customers to replace conventional fuels 
with renewable alternatives. This amounted 
to a 10% increase compared with 2021.
In 2022, we developed our carbon 
accounting methodologies for measuring 
upstream transport and emissions from 
crude oil extraction, so we can now 
account	for	the	benefits 	of	sourcing	
feedstock with lower carbon intensity. 
Upstream	feedstock	sourcing	represented	
16% of our total value chain emissions in 
2022 and we will work actively to reduce 
this material emission source. There is 
inadequate	regulation	and/or	financial	
incentive support to drive upstream 
emission reductions for conventional fuels. 
Consequently, driving emission reductions 
may	involve	financial	costs	that	reduce 	
competitiveness.
We have also expanded our carbon inventory 
to include additional scope 3 categories such 
as capital goods and end-of-life treatment.
Our work in 2023 and beyond
VARO’s work to reduce scope 3 emissions 
is closely connected to the ONE VARO 
Transformation strategy and our work with 
more sustainable products on pages 26-31 . 
We expanded our renewable business 
in January 2023 when VARO acquired 
a majority stake in biogas company Bio 
Energy Coevorden BV. The acquisition 
makes us a major European producer of 
biogas - a low-carbon fuel that will support 
our scope 3 intensity target (read more in 
the Case Study on page 38 ).
We will develop our capabilities to de-
carbonise by reducing our scope 3 
emissions, an integral component of our 
strategic business planning. We will also 
enhance our forecasting capabilities to 
cover not only our existing assets and 
production planning, but also the effects of 
planned mergers, acquisitions and business 
development activities.
In 2023, we will introduce internal carbon 
pricing as a component of our business 
case evaluations to promote low-carbon 
solutions (read more on page 18 ).

Developing the largest 
biogas facility in 
Northern Europe
We plan to double the capacity of the Bio Energy 
Coevorden BV (BEC) biogas facility in the Netherlands, 
boosting Europe’s energy security and accelerating the 
energy transition.
At the end of 2022, VARO announced 
the acquisition of 80% of BEC in the 
Netherlands, one of the largest biogas 
producers in Europe. We plan to invest 
EUR	100	million	to	double	the	biogas 	
manufacturing capacity of the plant to 650 
GWh by 2026, which will make it the third 
largest of its kind in Europe.
Demand for biomethane is expected to 
increase ten-fold across Europe by 2030, 
and bio-LNG is expected to grow ten-fold 
in Germany by the end of the decade. 
BEC will meet growing European demand 
for biogas and will accelerate the energy 
transition in the region.
“Large-scale biogas facilities have an 
important role in accelerating Europe’s 
sustainable energy transition as they offer 
an alternative to conventional fuels at scale 
with emissions 90% lower than natural 
gas,” says Dev Sanyal, VARO CEO. “The 
acquisition not only makes us a European 
biogas	leader,	but	it 	will	allow	our	refineries 	
to replace their natural gas consumption 
with biomethane products with a lower 
carbon intensity.”
From waste to renewable energy
The expansion of the BEC biogas plant will 
source its feedstock from waste streams 
and manure to annually avoid 220,000 
tonnes of CO2 compared with fossil natural 
gas.	This	is	a	significant	step	towards 	
achieving our net-zero scope 3 emissions 
target by 2040. The expansion will also 
support the circular economy and create 
new green jobs.
The BEC plant is located on the border 
between the Netherlands and Germany, 
close to large-scale agriculture providing 
an abundant supply of waste feedstock, 
and near major industrial centres that offer 
good market opportunities for biogas. The 
biogas	plant	is	already	highly	efficient,	with 	
state-of-the-art monitoring and control, 
heat optimisation and recovery systems.
Promoting energy security and 
the energy transition
The acquisition and planned expansion 
will boost energy security by diversifying 
Europe’s sources of supply, while 
accelerating the energy transition by 
replacing conventional fuels with low-
carbon alternatives. The expanded plant 
alone will meet 65% of VARO’s 2026 target 
to generate 1 TWh of biomethane / bio-
LNG. The acquisition will also contribute 
20%-25% of VARO’s Engine 2 (Renewable 
energies) EBITDA by 2026 and creates 
a platform for the growth of the biogas 
industry in Europe.

Other emissions to air
Emissions to air (tonnes) Development vs. 
previous year

Nitrogen oxides (NOx) + 12% 686 610 651
Sulphur oxides (SOx) + 3% 900 873 1,186
Diffuse hydrocarbons (VOC) + 31% 417 318 372
PM + 28% 8 6 9
Our main sources of non-greenhouse gas 
emissions from our manufacturing hubs 
are emitted from furnaces and boilers in 
the production process, which generate 
SOx, NOx and dust as by-products of the 
heating process. Our processing facilities 
and terminals adhere to the relevant strict 
local or federal emission standards and 
compliance	is	regularly	verified.	The	stacks 	
at our manufacturing hubs are designed to 
optimise the dilution of this smoke and we 
recover diffuse emissions, such as volatile 
organic compounds (VOCs). Advanced 
equipment such as infrared and optical 
gas cameras allow the early detection of 
any diffuse emission leaks, so we can take 
action quickly.
The storage and loading of gasoline can 
also cause emissions of VOCs, and we 
install	Vapour	Recovery	Units	where 	
needed to ensure permit limits for VOC. 
Preventive maintenance helps to minimise 
emissions and ensure equipment operates 
as expected. For example, at our Birsfelden 
terminal, VOC emissions in 2022 were 
0.18 kg/h, considerably lower than the 3 
kg/h limit prescribed by the Swiss Clean Air 
Ordinance legislation.

In 2022, our manufacturing hubs complied 
with all local environmental regulations and 
in line with our environmental permits. 
NOx emissions increased at both of our 
manufacturing hubs in 2022, compared 
with 2021, due to a mandatory temporary 
switch from natural gas to Liquid 
Petroleum Gas (LPG) in the production 
process to reduce European gas usage 
amid	the	Russian-Ukrainian	conflict.	The 	
Bayernoil manufacturing site experienced 
16% higher annual NOx emissions 
compared to 2021 and will install ultra-low 
NOx burners to reduce NOx emissions. 
At the Cressier manufacturing hub, annual 
NOx emissions were 9% higher in 2022 
compared with 2021 and were close to its 
annual NOx allocated emissions quota. The 
relatively high crude processing volumes 
contributed to increased NOx emissions for 
the hub.
SOx emissions of both manufacturing hubs 
were low during 2022. At Bayernoil, SOx 
emissions have decreased by 28% since 
2020 due to the installation of a sodium 
bicarbonate	injection	system	in	the	flue 	
gases	of	the	fluid	catalytic	cracker	(FCC). 	
The Cressier manufacturing hub only 
released about 20% of its SOx quota due 
to the use of low-sulphur content gas in 
furnaces and boilers.

at Cressier: Ordinance on Air Protection (Ordonnance sur la protection de l’air) at Cressier manufacturing hub.
We proactively work to minimise and reduce the non-
greenhouse gas emissions emitted by our operations.

Spills and spill prevention
Our approach
We work with comprehensive process 
safety to ensure that our processing 
plants, tank farms and loading systems 
are operated safely so we minimise and 
prevent spills. 
Our operations are managed by a Safety 
Management System and Operating 
Regulations. We also implement state-
of-the-art safety technology. VARO has 
a Safety and Response Plan procedure 
to manage our response related to spill 
incidents.	The	plan	defines	the	measures 	
and resources to be implemented in the 
event of an incident and coordinates action 
with the emergency services, if necessary.
Our process units are equipped and 
monitored by a variety of sensors, such 
as	pressure	and	flow,	to	quickly	identify 	
potential problems that could lead to 
or indicate a leak. Our employees are 
dedicated to controlling the production 
process and make regular inspections 
of the process units, tanks and loading 
facilities. We also conduct process Hazard 
and Operability Studies (Hazops) to help 
identify potential spill hazards.
As part of their safety training, we provide 
our employees and contractors with 
training on spill prevention and emergency 
spill management. All contractors and 
subcontractors must have the correct 
authorisation and follow our prevention 
plans, regular site audits and continuous 
surveillance.
We have comprehensive emergency 
planning and response procedures, and 
any leakage is immediately cleaned 
up according to our set procedures to 
minimise environmental damage and harm 
to people. We investigate and review 
the causes of any leak to inform future 
measures and minimise the chance of 
recurrence. Every two years, we hold a 
large	training	exercise	involving	local	fire 	
brigades, other emergency services and 
the local authorities. Smaller scale training 
is conducted more regularly.
Good dialogue and engagement with local 
stakeholders is an important part of our 
work with spill prevention. For example, 
at the Cressier manufacturing hub, we 
hold local stakeholder meetings each 
year to provide information on how we 
work to avoid spills from occurring and 
our processes in the event of an incident. 
We also provide local communities with 
a phone number to our control room that 
is available 24/7, and we have emergency 
response teams in the event of a spillage.
Our comprehensive management systems 
minimise and prevent spills.

Pipeline safety
The risk of spills also applies to the 
pipeline infrastructure that supplies our 
manufacturing hubs with crude oil, as 
pipeline ruptures can cause environmental 
damage. We regularly check above and 
below-ground pipelines for cracks, holes, 
deformations or deterioration of the 
pipeline walls due to corrosion or other 
faults, as well as internal inspections of 
pipelines with specialist equipment.
In France and Switzerland, we follow 
the strict French regulations that require 
pipeline inspections every four years. At 
the Bayernoil manufacturing hub, TÜV 
SÜD	inspects	and	verifies	compliance 	
with regulatory requirements. Pipelines 
are	also	fitted	with	leak	detection	systems 	
to	alert	in	case	of	any	decrease	in	flow	or 	
pressure. All pipelines are mapped with 
Geographic Information Systems and are 
clearly marked at ground level. Pipeline 
maintenance includes tree cutting and 
pruning.
Progress in 2022
As part of our long-term Maintenance and 
Surveillance Plan, we replaced 9.2 km of 
pipeline delivering crude oil to the Cressier 
manufacturing hub in 2022 to maintain our 
high standards of equipment integrity. We 
have	also	refined	and	improved	our	fire 	
procedures to include the risk of re-ignition 
after work has been completed. At the 
Bayernoil manufacturing hub, we installed 
a state-of-the-art emergency response 
container to facilitate more effective 
intervention in the event of a hydrocarbon 
leakage.
We aim to avoid all spills, regardless of 
size. VARO has a strong reporting culture 
and every spill – from a couple of litres 
to	large	spills	classified	as	Tier	1	and	Tier 	
2,	according	to	API	RP754	definitions	– 	
is centrally recorded and investigated. 
Unfortunately,	five	Tier	1	spills		occurred 	
in 2022. Even though the majority of these 
Tier 1 spills were low in severity, their 
potential to do harm is taken very seriously.  
Four Tier 1 spills were recorded at our 
terminal sites and one at the Bayernoil 
manufacturing hub. The majority of the 
spills recorded at the terminals occurred 
due to truck driver error when loading 
into secondary containment systems. One 
case was due to a failed isolation during 
maintenance work at a terminal. At the 
Bayernoil manufacturing hub, the Tier 1 
incident occurred due to the corrosion of 
a rarely used crude oil pipeline on the site. 
There was no harm to personnel and the 
contaminated soil was excavated and the 
area cleaned up.
We introduced corresponding measures 
based on ‘lessons learned’ to help avoid 
similar spills from happening in the 
future.	For	example,	we	have	modified 	
the checklist for drivers loading at VARO 
terminals in Switzerland, which were 
communicated to the users of VARO’s 
terminals.
2  The operational safety of pipelines delivering crude 
material to the Cressier manufacturing hub (SFPLJ 
pipeline in France, and OJNSA pipeline in Switzerland) 
is regulated by the French and Swiss regulations, such 
as the Ordinance OISTC on Pipeline Transportation 
Facilities Safety, the Ordinance OITC on Pipeline 
Transport Installations, the Directive IFP Federal 
Pipeline Inspection (in Switzerland), and the Ministerial 
Decree of 5 March 2014, which regulates the pipeline 
safety in France. VARO also uses safety management 
regulation such as the SGS Manual and OJNSA 
Operating Regulations.
3  API RP 754 is a Recommended Practice of the 
American	Petroleum	Institute,	which	identifies	process 	
safety	indicators	for	the	refining	and	petrochemical 	
industry.
4  Five Tier 1 spillages occurred at four different 
terminals in Switzerland (1), Germany (1), Benelux (2), 
and at the Bayernoil manufacturing hub. The spills 
involved volumes of 0.5-1.5m 3, 0.01 m3, 1m3, 4.7m3, 
and 46.5m 3 respectively.
In 2022, we organised a Group-wide safety 
stand-down at all our sites – including 
offices,	all	operating	sites	and	production 	
facilities to make personnel aware of spills, 
their potential to do harm and how they 
can be avoided.
Our work in 2023 and beyond
In 2023, we will implement a project at 
the Cressier manufacturing hub to further 
improve our leak detection and localisation 
capabilities. The project will involve the 
commissioning of a state-of-the-art leak 
detection system (LDS) that can detect 
very small leaks.

Biodiversity and land use Our approach
The Cressier manufacturing hub is located 
between two areas of natural habitats: one 
adjacent to the north-east, and the other 
located about 600 metres to the south 
across the Thielle River. 
At the Bayernoil manufacturing hub, the 
Neustadt site is located 200 metres from 
Lake Mauerner Badesee and adjacent to a 
forested area, and the Vohburg site lies to the 
north of a small forest and close to the Paar 
and Danube rivers. This is a Natura 2000 area 
that includes protected habitats and breeding 
grounds for rare and threatened species. 
There is one Flora Fauna Habitat (FFH) 300 
meters from Vohburg and another four FFHs 
5 km to 7 km from the site. The FFHs are 
home	to	beaver	and	several	species	of	fish,	
toads and slugs.
Both manufacturing hubs have a long 
history of protecting and promoting 
local biodiversity. Our sites conduct 
Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) 
and Species Protection Assessments 
to evaluate the potential impacts of 
activities on biodiversity. We also minimise 
discharges to avoid damaging local 
ecosystems.
We work closely with the local authorities 
and with neighbouring communities at 
the Cressier manufacturing hub on local 
biodiversity initiatives. All our investments 
are subject to approval by the authorities 
and neighbouring communities can voice 
any concerns they might have regarding 
local natural habitats.
Progress in 2022
Our operations were not subject to any 
fines	or	regulatory	breaches	related	to 	
adverse impacts on biodiversity in 2022.
We continued to apply our biodiversity 
mitigation hierarchy to assess planned 
investments. The hierarchy includes:
1.  Completely avoid negative impacts on 
biodiversity.
2.  Where avoidance is not possible – 
minimise the negative impact. 
3.  Where the impact occurs – remediate 
adverse effects. 
4.  If none of the above is possible – 
compensate by creating a positive 
impact on biodiversity elsewhere.
Our work in 2023 and beyond
We will continue to use our biodiversity 
mitigation hierarchy to assess future 
investments and ensure we continue to 
protect and promote local biodiversity.
At our Bayernoil manufacturing hub, we 
are conducting an Environmental Impact 
Assessment	for	our	Per-	and	polyfluoroalkyl 	
substances (PFAS) groundwater control 
project. We are working on minimising the 
impact from reduced groundwater level. 
We proactively safeguard and enhance 
biodiversity on our sites and use a 
biodiversity mitigation hierarchy to guide 
our work.

Waste	and	effluents	
Our approach
Waste management
Processing crude oil produces relatively 
small amounts of waste. By-products 
generated by processes are recycled 
and recovered back into production with 
residue undergoing the further cracking of 
larger hydrocarbon molecules to produce 
secondary products where possible. Sulphur 
produced	during	the	sulphur	purification	
process in hydrotreaters is also sold for use 
in other industrial processes. 
Besides generating waste streams of 
paper, glass and organic waste, there 
are other waste streams such as residual 
waste, blasting sand, insulation material, 
spent lye, carbonate sludge, oil-containing 
waste and scrap metal. All waste from our 
manufacturing hubs is recycled or disposed 
of in accordance with the relevant waste 
management legislation and regular on-site 
checks are performed together with the 
authorities. 
Bayernoil treats oil sludge with a decanter 
process, which separates the sludge 
into water and oil sludge. Cressier has 
an incinerator to combust oil sludge. In 
Germany, some waste from Bayernoil has 
secondary uses. 
Bayernoil conducts audits of its waste 
management contractors and has 
established processes to ensure they abide 
by legislation. VARO has immediately 
ended agreements if waste contractors 
have inadequate plans for waste materials. 
We also conduct internal audits to ensure 
compliance with our waste management 
requirements.
Effluent management
We effectively manage and monitor any 
effluent	discharges	from	our	sites.	We 	
have our own wastewater treatment plants 
and take regular site samples of soils 
and groundwater. Our larger sites pump 
groundwater to create hydraulic dams to 
prevent pollution.
With	processes	involving	flammable 	
substances, high temperature and high 
pressure,	fire	is	a	major	hazard	in	the 	
petroleum	refinery	industry.	We	avoid 	
the	use	of	firefighting	foams	that	contain 	
By recycling by-products back into our production,  
we produce relatively small amounts of waste.  
Effluent	discharges	are	effectively	managed	and	monitored	 
by well-established processes.
90% of the 30,627 tonnes 
of waste soil, concrete and 
railroad ballast generated 
by VARO was reused and 
diverted from landfill.
PFAS to minimise negative environmental 
impact. At our terminals, we use water for 
firefighting	training.
The separation of hydrocarbon-containing 
waste streams takes place on site at our 
terminals where hydrocarbons are separated 
from discharged water in oil separators. At 
Swiss terminals, discharge pipes to a water 
body have sensors that raise the alarm 
if the level of hydrocarbons is exceeded, 
and the discharge valve to the water body 
automatically closes to prevent pollution.

Progress in 2022
Waste management
Our Cressier manufacturing hub sorted 
its waste into 39 different waste streams 
in 2022. Of this waste, 39% was recycled, 
33% underwent energy recovery during 
waste treatment, 13% was treated in 
specific	facilities	as	hazardous	waste	and 	
15%	was	sent	to	landfill. 	
The Bayernoil manufacturing hub sent 92% 
of its waste for recovery. 7.8% of the hub’s 
waste was sent for disposal, including 7.4% 
hazardous waste and 0.4% non-hazardous 
waste.
Effluent management
In 2022, the Cressier and Bayernoil 
manufacturing hubs discharged 0.33 m 3 
and 0.41 m3	of	effluents	respectively	per 	
tonne of produced fuel on average.
All VARO sites operated well within the 
limits of the chemical, biological and 
physical	parameters	for	effluent	discharge 	
in the local environmental regulations 
during the year.
Our work in 2023 and beyond
Waste management
We will continue to minimise waste and 
identify	partners	that	can	find	secondary 	
uses of our waste products.
PFAS management
The	historic	use	of	PFAS	in	firefighting 	
foams is a growing concern in society 
due to increased knowledge about its 
adverse environmental and health impacts, 
particularly with regards to soil and water 
contamination. We are investigating 
whether our sites have been historically 
exposed to PFAS substances and what 
measures can be taken to mitigate impact.
This includes the presence of PFAS in 
groundwater that dates back to their use 
decades ago. We work closely with the 
authorities, local communities and NGOs 
to	define	and	implement	the	most	effective 	
way to resolve such issues.

CASE STORY
VARO and Lufthansa 
Group aim to decarbonise 
the aviation industry 
Through	a	Memorandum	of	Understanding,	the	
companies will explore the production and supply of 
Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) as early as 2026.
VARO aims to produce more than 250,000 
tonnes of biofuel a year by 2026, and has 
a long-term target of more than 500,000 
tonnes a year. A new agreement with 
Lufthansa to explore the production 
of SAF addresses a key element in the 
ONE VARO Transformation strategy and 
supports aviation industry decarbonisation 
ambitions.  
“Providing solutions to decarbonise the 
aviation industry is a central element of 
our customer-focused strategy,” explains 
Theo Pannekeet, EVP New Energies and 
Innovation at VARO. “The agreement with 
Lufthansa Group for the production and 
supply of Sustainable Aviation Fuel marks 
an important step in meeting the customer 
and societal need for aviation fuels that are 
both renewable and sustainable.”
Drawing on non-edible biogenic 
feedstock
It is important that the raw materials used 
to produce biofuels do not compete with 
the production of food or animal feed. 
Under	the	agreement,	both	companies	will	
jointly investigate the use of non-edible 
biogenic feedstock to produce green 
hydrogen that can potentially be used for 
SAF production.
Leading the way on low-carbon 
aviation
“We believe in SAF being a powerful tool 
to make aviation more climate friendly,” 
says Katja Kleffmann, Head of Fuel 
Management Supply Lufthansa Group. 
“We are engaged in the development of 
SAF markets and making SAF logistically 
available at airports. We are looking 
forward to our continued cooperation with 
VARO, which supports our sustainability 
strategy.”
“Our ONE VARO Transformation strategy 
is centred on meeting the need of our 
customers to decarbonise as they progress 
in the sustainable energy transition while 
maintaining supply reliability,” says Dev 
Sanyal, CEO of VARO. “This agreement 
builds on our long-standing partnership 
with the Lufthansa Group, one of the 
world’s largest airline groups, and I am 
excited to be working with them to 
accelerate the development and use of 
Sustainable Aviation Fuels.”

Health and safety
Safety is our top priority to protect the health and lives 
of our employees and contractors. It also helps avoid 
environmental damage and preserves the integrity and 
manufacturing capacity of our assets. Our approach is 
reflected	in	our	safety	culture	and	strict	procedures	for	
managing work-related hazards and employee health on 
our sites. We also encourage critical thinking and robust 
risk management.
Our targets Our progress in 2022
•  Company-wide Total Recordable Incident 
Rate (TRIR) target is ≤ 0.20 per 200,000 
work hours by 2035.
•  <0.01 (Tier 1) and <0.1 (Tier 2) process 
safety events per 200,000 work hours by 
2035.
•  TRIR of 0.9 per 200,000 work hours.
•  Zero fatalities.
Our approach
Working at VARO’s sites requires 
adherence	to	well-defined	and	strictly 	
enforced rules and procedures related to 
safety. Our manufacturing hubs follow 
international, 	national	and	industry-specific 	
regulations to manage biological, chemical, 
ergonomic and physical hazards. All our 
manufacturing hubs and terminals have 
VARO-specific	and	ISO	45001-certified 	
Health, Security, Safety and Environment 
(HSSE) management systems. For a full list 
of	certifications	held	by	our	facilities,	see 	
the	Certifications	section	on	page 64 .
We use Hazard and Operability Analysis 
(HAZOP) and Safety Integrity Level (SIL) 
assessments to manage and eliminate or 
reduce safety-related risks.
Extensive internal and external audits 
verify adherence to our standards and 
the effectiveness of our management 
system. The audits also provide a basis for 
continuous improvement on HSSE topics.
We are now implementing a VARO-wide 
programme is now being implemented 
to transform existing HSSE management 
systems into a risk-based Operational 
Excellence Management System (OEMS). 
We use a VARO-wide risk matrix to 
determine and classify risks. It also helps 
us to develop and prioritise risk-based 
actions and processes to mitigate these 
risks to acceptable levels. 
We focus on high-risk activities, such 
as: working under high temperatures, in 
confined	spaces,	excavation	activities, 	
safety system bypass, working at height 
and lifting activities. Detailed instructions 
for such activities regulate how to conduct 
work to mitigate risk.

Health and safety reporting 
and performance monitoring to 
manage risk 
Our incident categorisation and reporting 
is	based	on	categories	defined	by	the 	
US	Occupational	Safety	and	Health 	
Administration. We promote open and 
honest reporting where personnel are 
encouraged to report incidents, such 
as near misses, high potential incidents 
and minor spills. This provides us with an 
accurate status and guides our continuous 
improvement in HSSE. 
VARO monitors monthly key performance 
indicator (KPI) data for all operations. 
Following a review in 2022, we have 
introduced new leading and lagging KPIs to 
give a better risk overview.
We analyse company-wide safety 
performance monthly. Our Operational Risk 
Committee (ORC), which is presided over 
by the CEO, reviews a high-level summary. 
The ORC reviews overall performance 
development as well as any incidents, with 
a focus on serious injuries, spills and high-
potential incidents.
Incident investigation and follow up
VARO continuously monitors and reports 
incidents and performs risk assessments 
to identify and classify risk in various 
scenarios. Events that have caused or 
can	potentially	cause	significant	harm	to 	
humans, the environment and assets are 
classified	as	‘high-potential	incidents’	or 	
‘near misses’. 
All incidents and ‘near misses’ are 
investigated and their root causes 
are	identified	to	help	adjust	or	create	
procedures and take action to prevent their 
recurrence in the future. Following a root 
cause analysis, we prioritise corrective and 
preventative actions to eliminate or minimise 
the causes of an incident. All investigations 
are recorded in our incident tracking system 
and follow-up actions are reviewed on a 
monthly basis. Learnings from incidents are 
shared with the workforce. 
Employee engagement on safety
Our precautionary measures to mitigate 
risks include providing the necessary 
personal protective equipment and training 
to enable employees and contractors to 
work safely. We proactively communicate, 
consult and involve all relevant employees 
and contractors in health and safety 
topics. We engage with them through 
various channels and forums including 
tool-box meetings, daily production and 
maintenance meetings, our intranet and 
risk assessments.
We provide relevant safety training to 
each employee and adapt it to operational 
changes. We have a ‘Health and Safety 
Manual for Contractors’ and provide formal 
site-specific	induction	programmes	on 	
health and safety hazards for contractors 
and visitors. 
Employee health and well-being
VARO has various initiatives that promote 
employee health and well-being including 
mental health. During pre-placement at 
work, we assess potential impacts on 
employee health based on an occupational 
health matrix. This is based on a health-
risk	profile,	illness	statistics	and	specific 	
hazards	identified	for	each	site.	Our 	
production sites are equipped with medical 
facilities and medical professionals as 
necessary. 
At some locations, VARO offers on-site 
employee gym facilities, as well as yoga 
and CrossFit lunchtime classes at nearby 
facilities.
Emergency plans are in place to cover 
hazards related our operations. These 
include	fire,	explosions,	toxic	releases, 	
and on-site injury and rescue scenarios. 
Our emergency plans are reviewed 
annually and are regularly tested through 
internal exercises and with the external 
emergency services. We learn from these 
exercises to further improve our approach.

includes the likelihood of rail transportation 
safety risks. Control measures include 
maintenance requirements for the entire 
fleet	on	a	four-year	cycle.	We	also	ensure 	
regular safety training for employees and 
partners that operate trains on our behalf. 
For sea and river transport, VARO has 
verification	processes	and	inspections	for 	
its barges and the external companies from 
which we lease vessels to promote safety. 
For leased barges, we engage third parties 
in technical inspections to evaluate the risk 
level of nearly 300 onboard aspects and 
desk inspections. In 2022, we interrupted 
the operation of one vessel following 
the	identification	of	inadequate	safety 	
practices.
Progress in 2022
The number of TIER 1 events increased 
while the number of TIER 2 events 
remained similar to 2021. This resulted in 
an overall increase in the Process Safety 
Events (PSE) rate due to the increase 
in TIER 1 events. TIER 1 events are 
mostly	classified	as	the	lowest	severity. 	
Nevertheless, we take the development 
seriously and launched a VARO-wide 
safety standstill with discussion and 
feedback	at	all	our	terminals,	refineries 	
and	offices	that	underlined	our	primary 	
message of safety being our number one 
priority.
Severe injuries are rare at VARO, compared 
with the industry in general. Our total 
injury rates in 2022 were however higher 
than	our	target	levels,	which	reflect	high 	
industry standards. In 2022, the TRIR for 
VARO was 0.9 per 200,000 work hours on 
Safe transportation 
VARO promotes safe driving through the 
implementation of driving standards for 
VARO truck drivers, direct contractors 
delivering VARO products and VARO 
employees who are frequent business

average. Our target for 2025 is to achieve 
a TRIR of <0.5.
A systematic approach for continuous 
improvement 
Our multi-year and company-wide plan 
aims to systematically improve our HSSE 
performance, with stronger barriers against 
potential serious injuries and incidents. This 
follows our modern, standardised approach 
to HSSE and risk management based on 
our OEMS. Our approach will drive a safety 
culture of continuous improvement and 
ultimately ensure that we follow the same 
procedures throughout our organisation – 
no matter where we operate. 
The OEMS is also important to support the 
integration of new businesses following our 
ONE VARO Transformation strategy and 
the further expansion into the renewable 
energy industry. An example is the newly 
acquired Biogas business in Coevorden, 
which is integrated into the same 
systematic HSSE structure and culture as 
our other manufacturing hubs. Read more 
on page 38.
Employee health and well-being
In 2022, we held ‘health promotion weeks’ 
that included several presentations on 
health topics such as sleep, nutrition, 
ergonomics	and	first	aid.	As	part	of	our 	
focus on employee mental health and well-
being, we provided free access to an online 
tool supporting meditation, relaxation, 
mindfulness and better sleep habits to 
support employees affected by stress 
and anxiety.
Our	employees	continue	to	benefit 	
from well-being measures introduced 
during the COVID-19 pandemic to stay 
connected and conduct their work 
remotely. 
One example is our anonymous 
helpline, rolled out in Germany during 
the pandemic, to give employees 
the opportunity to talk with a trained 
psychologist, which was extended to all 
VARO locations in 2022. 
Our work in 2023 and beyond
We recognise that we still have work to 
do to improve our safety performance. 
In 2023, we will continue our systematic 
approach to mitigate risk and to prevent 
serious injuries and incidents. We are 
launching several initiatives to improve 
safety. We will continue our asset 
integrity reviews and will use the results to 
feed into improvement plans that we are 
developing to promote a high standard of 
asset integrity.
We are planning to roll out our process 
safety training for leadership functions in 
terminals and manufacturing hubs to raise 
risk awareness. 
As part of improving our current asset 
base and integrating new businesses, 
we are expanding our central HSSE 
organisation and introducing new 
competences, such as:
 
VARO Energy ESG Report 2022
51

Page 52:
• A new HSSE Manager to support 
our current activities and guide our 
businesses to continuous improvement.
• A Process Safety and Asset Integrity 
Manager to enhance our approach to 
our Operational Excellence Management 
System and process safety.
• Another role will focus on the HSSE 
risks in retail and our marine activities.
New VARO-wide initiatives 
Our new OEMS will set minimum safety 
requirements for our entire business and 
drive continuous improvement. 
Building on our experience from the 
Cressier manufacturing hub, we will roll 
out company-wide lifesaving rules from the 
IOGP (International Association of Oil & 
Gas Producers) to further enhance barriers 
to prevent severe injuries and fatalities. 
The rules will be accompanied by a new 
Stop Work Authority (SWA) initiative that 
enables anyone to stop an activity they 
deem unsafe. 
We also plan to introduce the Process 
Safety Fundamentals initiative, which will 
help our employees to understand and 
avoid high-risk events. The implementation 
will begin at the Cressier manufacturing 
hub before being rolled out at our other 
manufacturing hubs.
Our Just Culture initiative, which aims to 
improve our safety reporting culture and 
avoid incidents, is already used by our 
manufacturing hubs. During 2023, we will 
roll out the initiative throughout VARO.
Improving transport safety 
In 2023, VARO will introduce an improved 
risk-based process to ensure barges, 
vessels and their personnel can safely 
transport our products on waterways. 
We will also use digital tools to further 
increase the safety of our logistics 
operations, for example by using GPS 
mapping for trains and implementing 
automatic train wagon coupling to increase 
safety and save time.

Equity, inclusion and 
diversity
Our work with equity, inclusion and diversity drives 
employee motivation, provides diverse perspectives and 
helps to attract and retain talent.
Our targets Our progress in 2022
•		At	least	50%	female	employees	in	office-
based positions by 2030.
•		40%	female	office-based	employees.
•  50% senior managers are women 
by 2030.
•  16% female senior managers.
• Gender pay gap of <10%. •  <10% difference in pay based on gender 
identified	in	analyses	in	Benelux	and 	
Germany in 2022.
Our approach
VARO’s heritage and success to date is 
based on bringing together and embracing 
the different backgrounds and cultures of 
around 20 companies, each with a history 
of entrepreneurship. We believe that 
different ways of working create value. We 
will continue to champion this diversity as 
we expand and transform our business, to 
meet the changing requirements related 
to the transition to a sustainable energy 
system.
We believe that VARO’s diverse 
environment is an important cornerstone 
for the company to attract and retain the 
best talent.
Giving everyone equal opportunities to 
reach their maximum potential is at the 
heart of our approach to equity, inclusion 
and diversity (EI&D). We aim to support 
every person with what they need to 
succeed – whether opportunity, networks, 
resources or support – based on where 
they are starting from.
We are committed to providing equal 
opportunities in the hiring, promotion and 
compensating employees. Employees 
should not be discriminated against based 
on their race, colour, religion, sex, gender, 
gender identity or expression, sexual 
orientation, national origin, genetics, 
disability or age. We have zero tolerance 
for harassment – including verbal, 
physical and other forms of harassment.
Our EI&D Policy, adopted in May 2022, 
covers all business relationships and 
expects all our employees to exhibit 
conduct	that	reflects	inclusion	while	at 	
work, whether colleagues, customers, 
suppliers, authorities, stakeholders 
or any member of the public. Our 
EI&D Steering Committee manages 
the effectiveness of our EI&D policies 
and actions, and alignment with our 
transformation strategy.

Progress in 2022
We continued to focus on gender diversity, 
and we have launched a new hiring plan 
as part of our ONE VARO Transformation 
strategy.	Out	of	the	23	positions	filled	in 	
2022, we recruited 12 women at a senior 
management level. We demanded that 
our headhunting company include women 
on applicant shortlists and did not begin 
interviews	until	this 	objective	was	fulfilled.
The	proportion	of	female	office-based 	
employees at VARO was 40% by the end 
of 2022. Women accounted for 16% of 
our	senior	managers	(defined	at	VARO	as 	
Category 6 and above).
Following the completion of a gender pay 
gap analysis in Switzerland in 2021, we 
conducted similar analyses in Benelux and 
Germany	in	2022.	The	analyses	confirmed 	
that VARO has a gender pay gap of <10%. 
In Switzerland, the ratio of payment to men 
and	women	with	the	same	qualifications 	
was 6.7% in favour of men, and at the 
Cressier manufacturing hub it was 11.3% in 
favour of women. In Benelux, the ratio was 
0.6% in favour of men, and in Germany it 
was 4.1% in favour of women. 
We have launched a Flexible Work Policy 
that provides our employees with the 
opportunity to work remotely up to two 
days per week – if suitable for their duties 
and department. We hope that the policy 
helps	employees	to	find	a	better	work-life 	
balance.
Our work in 2023 and beyond
We will continue to promote equal 
opportunities when we hire, promote and 
pay employees – towards our EI&D 2030 
targets.
Focusing on recruitment is however not 
enough to promote EI&D and support our 
female and diverse talent to thrive. Our 
EI&D work will be an integral part of our 
employee satisfaction and development 
work (read more in the Employee 
satisfaction and development section on 
page 55). To support the work-life balance 
for our employees with young children, we 
have started to provide subsidised child 
day	care	near	our	Swiss	office	in	2023.

Employee satisfaction 
and development
We care about the well-being of our colleagues and provide 
career opportunities, employee engagement, and personal 
and professional development. This approach also drives our 
business success.
Our targets Our progress in 2022
•  >75% engagement level by 2025.
•  Maintain >90% voluntary employee 
retention rate.
•		Conducted	our	first	Employee 	
Satisfaction Survey to create a baseline.
• Voluntary employee retention rate of 94%.
•  Improved employee development 
opportunities.
Our approach
We aim to create an environment where 
people feel they can speak up and be 
heard, which aims to boost our creativity 
and innovation, while empowering 
employees to engage. Our Employee 
Handbook and policies such as our Code 
of Conduct and our new Flexible Work 
Policy,	which	clarifies	our	conditions	for 	
flexible	and	remote	working,	guide	our 	
approach to employee satisfaction and 
development. We also promote employee 
dialogue through various channels and 
person-to-person encounters to support 
our employee culture.
We encourage our employees to act in 
accordance with our company values – 
to aim high, embrace challenges, drive 
pace and solve together. A sense of 
responsibility and respect to people and 
planet should be at the heart of everything 
we do. Our values were updated in 2022 
following input from a broad range of 
employees.
 
Employee satisfaction
We	aim	to	enable	employees	to	find 	
a good work-life balance. Employee 
satisfaction is also related to equal 
opportunities, equal treatment and non-
discrimination as well as competitive pay 
(read more in the Equity, inclusion and 
diversity section on page 53 ). We conduct 
regular people surveys, and we then review 
aggregated results and compare them with 
high-performing companies. Action plans 
are then prepared for themes that require 
specific	attention.	
Employee development
The personal and professional 
development of our employees is key to 
our succession planning and business 
continuity as we continuously identify 
individuals with potential. Development is 
also vital to empower our employees and 
to promote their continued attractiveness 
on the job market. VARO encourages 
employees to further their capabilities, 
knowledge, skills and competencies by 
networking with other professionals and 
pursuing formal training. 
We provide annual employee performance 
reviews as part of our Performance 
Evaluation Process. The reviews focus 
on assessing employee performance and 
promoting development and career growth 
by making development plans and setting 
personal targets. 
Our ‘Lunch & learn’ sessions encourage 
our employees to share experiences. 
The sessions also offer education and 
development opportunities delivered by in-
house subject experts, and are supported 
by e-learning materials.
Learning & development
•  We expect VARO to have a career, succession, 
learning and development plan.
Collaborate & communicate
•		We	expect	VARO	to	have	clearly	defined	roles	and 	
responsibilities and to be organised in a systematic, 
functional and agile way.
Feedback & recognition
•  We expect VARO to have a culture of regular 
constructive and fair feedback on general 
performance, but also particular achievements.
We have focused on the following topics:

Progress in 2022
High employee satisfaction helped us to 
achieve a voluntary retention rate of 94% in 
2022. Our target is to achieve and maintain 
a voluntary retention rate of above 90%. 
Employee satisfaction
We have created a new Employee 
Satisfaction Survey and have improved 
our processes to analyse, involve key 
stakeholders and take action. This resulted 
in	record	participation	rate	for	a VARO 	
survey. The survey highlighted good 
employee awareness and appreciation of 
our HSSE work.
The feedback collected during the survey 
provided deep insights and shed light 
on areas requiring greater attention as 
we progress. To tackle these concerns, 
a dedicated cross-functional and cross-
regional focus group has developed an 
action plan.
Our values
• We are open to new ideas to challenge 
our thinking.
• We turn challenges into opportunities.
• We are eager to learn and grow.
• We are entrepreneurial with a shared purpose.
• We push ourselves, our business, and our industry 
into unchartered territories.
• We strive for success and overcome adversity.
• We take collective responsibility for the safety of all.
• We build diverse teams to unlock our full potential.
• We invest in strong partnerships and know-how.
•  We have an agile, can-do mindset and 
deliver on our promises.
• We are restless with the status quo.
•  We make rapid progress because of 
the foundations we have built.
At VARO, we always aim high, we 
challenge the status quo and we solve 
together. This is how we act to make a 
difference in society and drive the pace of 
change in our industry.

In October 2022, the VARO Board decided 
to make a one-off payment to help 
compensate employees on lower salaries 
for higher living costs in society. This 
amounted to between 2,000 and 4,000 
Euros / Swiss Francs depending on job 
category. 
VARO always seeks to pay fair wages 
and benchmarks salaries against industry 
peers. In 2022, we conducted an exercise 
to benchmark our compensation using 
the Mercer benchmark. VARO’s pension 
fund also offers higher returns than state 
pension funds and compulsory health 
insurance covers loss of earnings, parental 
leave, and social and accident insurance.
Employee development
In 2022, 85% of our employees completed 
a performance review. Our total training 
budget	in	2022	was	USD	1.6	million. 	
VARO has a long-term partnership with 
IMD Business School Executive Education 
in Lausanne. We continue to offer high-
quality IMD training to our employees. Two 
customised VARO sessions took place in 
2022,	which	each	involved	18	first-level 	
leaders.
Our work in 2023 and beyond
We will continue to implement initiatives 
that promote employee satisfaction and 
development, while addressing focus 
areas that were highlighted by our 2022 
Employee Satisfaction Survey.  
To address employee expectations, we will 
strive to achieve the following actions and 
goals in 2023:
As we continue to grow in 2023, we 
will open new spaces for both our main 
offices	in	Switzerland	and	the	Netherlands. 	
These spaces will provide our employees 
with modern and high-quality work 
environments with natural light, as well as 
more spaces for employee collaboration. 
They will also offer healthy snacks and 
food.
We will incentivise employees to use public 
transport and make e-bikes available for 
short journeys. Healthy lifestyles will be 
promoted by providing our employees with 
new	offers	for	yoga	classes,	cross	fit	and 	
gyms.
While some of these actions will be 
implemented at short notice, others will 
require more time and will therefore be 
managed	as	projects.	We	are	confident 	
that these actions and the broader 
changes we are making will have a positive 
impact on everyone’s experience at VARO. 
We will continue to regularly assess and 
optimise this work in the coming years.
Our objectives  
in 2023 and 2024
Learning and development
• Reinforce PEP process to promote 
quality development discussions.
• Structure an annual review of 
talent development and succession 
planning.
• Provide more accessible learning 
opportunities.
Collaboration and communication
• Improve two-way vertical 
communication throughout the 
organisation.
• Continuous review and 
improvement of communication.
Feedback and recognition
• Organise training on how to provide 
and receive feedback.
• Publish our Reward Policy.
• Encourage a culture of recognition 
between teams and peers.

Local community 
engagement
We believe our licence to operate builds on providing positive 
local	benefit	in	the	communities	in	which	we	operate,	and	we	
prioritise maintaining good relations with local authorities and 
the residents of neighbouring communities.
Our approach
Along with our contribution to energy 
security and energy transition in society, 
our licence to operate is also based 
on a positive contribution to the local 
communities in which we work. VARO’s 
business provides local employment and 
we are investing in technologies such as 
solar energy and district heating, which 
benefit	local	communities. 	
Transparent communication
Open communication and frequent 
dialogue help to maintain good 
relationships with local communities. 
We inform local communities about 
disruptions, planned overhaul activities 
and turnarounds, and the impact they may 
have. Our HSSE Policy requires each VARO 
company to communicate openly with all 
stakeholders	on	relevant	HSSE topics.
We use various communication channels 
and share information through our 
website, third-party websites and in 
local newspapers. We also maintain an 
emergency hotline for the community 
to express their concerns. Neighbouring 
communities can voice any concerns they 
might have, such as regarding development 
projects and natural habitats. 
At our Cressier manufacturing hub, we 
have created a virtual sustainability map 
to inform the public about our initiatives 
in environmental protection, energy 
efficiency,	safety	and	social	engagement. 	
The map covers 46 initiatives to improve 
sustainability on the site, which covers 
areas such as energy conservation, 
biodiversity, noise, advanced biofuels, CO 2 
emission reduction, and the treatment of 
contamination. The map is accessible at 
https://sustainability-varoenergy.com/en/ .
Our HSSE Policy requires VARO to 
communicate openly with all stakeholders 
on relevant HSSE topics. Local authorities 
are key stakeholders and we arrange 
site	visits	for	local	officials	every	year	to 	
exchange ideas and concerns about past, 
present and future activities. 
The Bayernoil manufacturing hub organises 
open days at least once a year to present 
their activities and future plans to local 
stakeholders. Our Cressier manufacturing 
hub also organises site visits for groups 
with a special interest in our operations.
Emergency preparedness
As we operate facilities and products 
that involve inherent risks, such as those 
involving	fire,	cooperation	on	security	and 	
safety, we have active cooperation and 
training with local emergency services 
(read more about crisis management on 
page 70). 
Community engagement and 
support
We strive to provide a positive 
contribution though actively supporting 
local projects and other initiatives related 
to people in need though our local 
community engagement programmes 
and sponsorships. 
At the Cressier manufacturing hub, we 
work with neighbouring communities to 
enhance biodiversity.

Noise disturbance
Our operations can create disturbance 
such as noise, air emissions (read more 
about air quality on page 39 )	and	effluent	
discharges (read more about our approach 
to	effluent	management	on	page 43 ). 
Managing noise pollution includes both 
protecting employees exposed to high 
noise levels during the production process, 
and minimising noise disturbance to the 
communities surrounding our production 
facilities. Noise has historically been an 
issue at our Cressier manufacturing hub, 
which is in close proximity to communities. 
We have invested over CHF 4.5 million to 
install equipment that has helped to halve 
noise pollution since 2004. 
According to noise impact assessments 
within a 4.5 km 2 area surrounding the 
Cressier manufacturing hub, the most 
significant	sources	of	noise	were	the	site’s 	
cooling fans. Consequently, we changed 
the blades of nearly 80 fans to reduce 
noise.	We	have	also	modified	other	kinds 	
of equipment and built anti-noise walls to 
further reduce noise levels. Noise under 
normal operations is now at a level that is 
acceptable to the community. 
We monitor noise from our sites and act 
quickly to reduce noise disturbance for 
local communities. During regular control 
checks, we monitor equipment that might 
affect noise levels during the day and 
night. We maintain regular contact with 
the local authorities regarding abnormal 
noise disturbance. Such events happen 
mostly when equipment fails or during 
shutdown/start-up operations. If we 
discover abnormal noise or in the case 
of a complaint, the source of the noise is 
identified	and	relevant	actions	are	taken	by 	
our production teams. 
At both Bayernoil sites – Neustadt and 
Vohburg – noise engineers have assessed 
noise pollution and advised on mitigating 
actions, including switching to quieter 
equipment. We have taken action in recent 
years to minimise noise levels from the 
FCC and the steam methane reformer 
(SMR), which are the main sources of noise 
at the Neustadt site. Our outstanding focus 
area is the platformer unit following its 
throughput increase in 2022. 
Progress in 2022
On VARO’s 10th anniversary, we organised 
a special meeting with the local authorities 
close to our Cressier manufacturing hub. 
The meeting celebrated the launch of our 
ONE VARO Transformation strategy at the 
same place VARO was founded 10 years 
earlier. It was attended by VARO’s CEO, 
several members of the local and corporate 
management, as well as representatives 
of the government of the Neuchâtel region 
(Canton of Neuchâtel).
In 2022, VARO supported various cultural 
events and infrastructure initiatives around 
the Cressier manufacturing hub. 
VARO Energy ESG Report 2022

Page 60:
This included the Seul en scène Cressier 
music festival, the rock festival Corn’rock 
and a regional organisation for socio-
cultural activities for young people. We also 
renovated public playgrounds and sports 
facilities, replaced the heating system in a 
public building and repaired roads damaged 
during	flooding	in	2021.
To further improve our communication and 
dialogue with society we have updated our 
website and all stakeholders are now better 
informed about VARO’s activities, strategy 
and progress to achieve our objectives. 
We have also improved our social media 
presence, especially on LinkedIn with 
weekly	news	on	our	CEO’s profile.
In 2022, we organised a series of events for 
children in Switzerland called Zukunfstag. 
Young children visited our Cressier 
manufacturing	hub	and	office	during	these	
events to become familiar with our industry 
and company. We conducted visits to 
various production facilities, organised 
quizzes, and responded to the children’s 
questions. The idea is to inspire children’s 
curiosity and interest in various professions 
within the energy sector.
Minimising noise disturbance
We received no complaints related to noise 
disturbance from local stakeholders around 
our Bayernoil sites in 2022. At the Cressier 
manufacturing hub, noise control measures 
helped to reduce noise-related complaints 
from 17 in 2021 to one single complaint 
in 2022.
As the majority of Cressier complaints in 
2021 were related to the shutdown and 
renewal of facilities particularly to noise 
from	a	safety	flare,	a	sound	level	meter 	
was	installed	close	to	the	flare	in	2022	to 	
enable us to quickly react to excessive 
noise disturbance. We also piloted quieter 
burners.
Support for Ukraine
In response to the devastating war in 
Ukraine,	VARO	contributed	to	refugee	relief	
initiatives. We also created employment 
opportunities within our own organisation. 
In Hamburg, we onboarded three refugees 
into our workforce. 
Our communications team has engaged 
with	freelancers	from	Ukraine,	paying	them	
competitive rates aligned with Western 
European standards, where they currently 
reside.  
We extended monetary donations to 
organisations providing direct aid to people 
who	fled	Ukraine.	We	also	donated	a	
variety of goods to local refugee shops in 
Switzerland.
Our work in 2023 and beyond
Going forward, informing local 
communities is an important part of our 
new ESG strategy, and particularly the 
development of Engine 2 of our One 
VARO Transformation strategy. Keeping 
communities informed is part of our goal 
to transform into a low-carbon energy 
generation business. We are developing 
district heating systems to use waste heat 
from industrial processes at our Cressier 
manufacturing hub to heat homes in 
the adjacent municipalities. We are also 
constructing the largest ground-mounted 
solar farm in Switzerland on the Cressier 
site, which will provide renewable electricity 
to both the manufacturing hub and local 
society. We are implementing the project 
together with the local electricity supplier 
Groupe E (Read more in the Emissions 
section on page 35).

Managing our 
material ESG topics
Our approach
 
At VARO, we are committed to conducting 
our business while causing zero harm 
to people and the environment, and 
respecting our neighbouring communities. 
This means respecting the environment 
and protecting the safety and health of 
those who work with us. We strive to 
comply with the relevant environmental 
legislation and have a policy to 
continuously improve our performance 
and to communicate openly with all 
stakeholders. 
VARO has a comprehensive approach to 
the governance of material sustainability 
topics involving our Board and 
management team. Management of ESG is 
integrated and cascaded down throughout 
the organisation through a number of 
committees	that	oversee	specific	ESG-
related topics (read more in the Corporate 
governance section on page 65 ). Our 
management and support systems are 
designed to enable corporate governance 
to function smoothly and effectively.

Certified management systems 
VARO is committed to conducting 
its business while causing zero harm 
to people and the environment, and 
respecting neighbouring communities. 
Our management system is based on the 
International Standards Organisation (ISO) 
9001 for Quality Management and ISO 
14001 for Environmental Management. 
The quality of our Integrated Management 
System approach to environmental and 
safety	performance	is 	reflected	in	our	
various	certifications,	as	shown	in	the	table 	
below.	Bayernoil’s	EU	Eco-Management 	
and	Audit	Scheme	(EMAS)	certification 	
goes beyond the requirements of the 
ISO 14001 environmental management 
system and can be considered equivalent. 
Regular	internal	and	external	certification	
audits schemes ensure that our asset 
management processes are based on 
responsible business practices, oriented 
towards continuous performance 
improvement, and meet our required 
obligations.
Memberships 
The Bayernoil manufacturing hub is part 
of	the	Umwelt	+	Klimapakt	Bayern1 	
(the Environmental and Climate Pact of 
Bavaria), which is a cooperation between 
the Government of the Free State of 
Bavaria and over 4,000 local companies. 
The pact establishes a cooperation in 
which businesses undertake various 
obligations related to improving their 
climate-related performance, setting 
up or enhancing their environmental 
management systems, and improving 
resource	efficiency.	In	turn,	state 	
authorities	provide	financial	support 	
for such initiatives, as well as expert 
recommendations and other types of 
assistance.

Internal governance structure
To facilitate VARO’s strategy, business 
development and effective decision 
making, VARO has established a 
governance structure with dedicated 
committees supporting the EB. 
VARO’s dedicated ESG Committee  
oversees the implementation and 
effectiveness of our ESG programmes and 
manages risk, including our climate-related 
targets.	The	committee	defines	ESG 	
priorities, objectives and strategy. It aims 
to further integrate sustainability into our 
strategy and operations, and oversees the 
implementation of our ESG initiatives and 
performance. 
ESG topics are also managed in other 
governance committees. For example:
The Operational Risk Committee  
oversees issues related to HSSE. VARO 
promotes the reporting of all HSSE 
incidents and the HSSE Director issues a 
monthly summary and trend analysis to 
the EB. The SB is updated on HSSE on a 
quarterly basis and on individual incidents 
when necessary.
The Human Resources Committee  acts 
to	fulfil	objectives	to	improve	performance 	
in topics detailed in the Social aspects 
of the ESG programme. This includes 
employee satisfaction and development, 
equity, inclusion and diversity, human 
rights, non-retaliation and grievance 
mechanisms, and local community 
engagement.
The Business Development Committee  
assesses potential business initiatives that 
align with VARO’s strategic goals, including 
the ESG strategy.
Decisions on investments, such as in 
energy transition projects, are made 
centrally by the  Investment Committee  
and approved by the SB, as part of the 
annual budget process or as part of 
extraordinary meetings for projects outside 
the budget. Investments at the Bayernoil 
manufacturing hub are decided on by the 
joint venture’s three shareholders, including 
VARO.

Enterprise risk management 
system
VARO	is	exposed	to	various	financial	risks 	
– including those related to the energy 
transition, commodity prices, foreign 
currency	exchange	rates,	financing	and 	
credit risk. During 2022, we conducted 
a comprehensive risk review with the 
support of external risk management 
specialists.
VARO’s Enterprise Risk Management 
(ERM) system provides a clear framework 
for managing and reporting risks in our 
business activities and operations to the 
SB and its sub-committees. 
Risk management includes the daily 
monitoring of the market, monthly Group 
Risk Oversight Committee (ROC) meetings, 
and real-time credit risk and market risk 
evaluation	and	reporting.	Significant	risk 	
exposures from prices and markets are 
reported to and discussed by the ROC. 
Our management systems and Code of 
Conduct, combined with our organisational 
structures, processes, controls, standards, 
compliance and ethics, together form our 
system of internal control (SIC), which 
governs how we conduct business and 
manage risk. 
VARO’s internal control system is 
periodically assessed by the AC. The AC will 
advise the Board on the adequacy of the 
combined assurance provided by our risk 
management procedures.
ESG Risk management 
ESG risk management is integrated into 
the ERM process, where ESG risks and 
opportunities 	are	identified,	assessed	
and integrated into the ONE VARO’s 
Transformation strategy, business planning, 
ESG objectives and management, 
through VARO’s designated Governance 
Committees.

Examples of risk areas
Climate change and energy  
transition risk  
Developments in regulations, technology 
and the market related to climate change 
and the transition to a low-carbon society 
could increase or decrease demand for 
certain products within our portfolio. 
This could ultimately change our revenue 
and business outlook and alter investor 
sentiment,	our	financial	performance	and	
our competitiveness.
The regulatory environment to support 
decarbonisation is evolving. We are 
investing in Sustainable Energies (Engine 2 
of our One VARO Transformation strategy) 
to strengthen our market positions, 
and	we	expect	to	benefit 	from	future	
legislative changes. We monitor research 
and global market data to determine 
future investments, such as electric and 
hybrid vehicle sales, and the shift from 
conventional fuels to sustainable energy 
solutions. 
Our	competitiveness	and	profitability	may	
also be affected by the increased severity 
of extreme weather events, such as storms 
and	floods,	change	in	precipitation	patterns	
and greater variability in weather patterns, 
combined with the rising mean temperature, 
sea and river levels. Such events may lead to 
price volatility, reduced demand, unexpected 
operational disruptions, asset write-offs and 
financial	losses.	In	the	coming	two	years,	
VARO will further integrate physical climate 
risk into its ERM process and conduct a 
Climate Scenario Analysis aligned with 
TCFD recommendations.
External market risk
We are exposed to market price 
fluctuations	for	oil	products,	renewable 	
fuels, carbon, other commodity inputs 
such as natural gas, electricity, interest 
rates, and to foreign currency exchange 
rate	fluctuations	and	the	general 	
macroeconomic outlook.
The oil market is subject to geopolitical 
factors that shape global supply 
and demand. Besides managing the 
associated price risks, we seek to ensure 
supply	continuity	by	operating	flexible	
manufacturing models that are not 
dependent on the supply of certain grades 
of crude oil.
Geopolitical risks 
VARO has established a cross-
functional internal team to closely 
monitor developments and to ensure 
compliance with sanctions across our 
business. The team continuously assesses 
risk implications, and manages: the 
continuity of crude procurement, the 
supply of products to our customers, 
the optimisation of our market positions 
and inventory levels to ensure effective 
risk management, funding implications 
to	maintain	sufficient	liquidity,	and	also 	
focuses on credit and performance risk 
exposure. 
VARO has acted proactively by substituting 
Russian crude oil with other products since 
the	start	of	the	conflict	in	February	2022, 	
and fully abides by all relevant sanctions.  
Ethical misconduct  
and non-compliance risk 
The Group’s policies and Code of Conduct 
state that all our employees must comply 
with all the applicable regulations and 
company policies that govern their work, 
including those related to anti-trust 
and competition, anti-bribery and the 
environment. Our employees are obliged 
to report any suspected violation of 
regulations, policies, procedures or the 
Code of Conduct to VARO’s General 
Counsel, including concerns related to 
accounting non-compliance, fraud or 
corruption. Employees who raise concerns 
or help to resolve reported matters are 
protected against retaliation.
Information and cyber security 
VARO operates critical infrastructure that 
is reliant on information technology and 
operational technology systems, including 
services to support business-critical 
manufacturing and supply chain processes.  
The size, age and complexity of our 
infrastructure makes us potentially 
vulnerable to internal and external security 
threats, intrusions, attacks and outages. 
This includes state-sponsored cybercrimes 
that could affect our ability to perform 
critical tasks, safeguard privacy and 
commercially sensitive data, and ensure 
safe and reliable service availability. It 
could also result in injury or direct harm 
to people, local communities or the 
environment, the loss of customer trust, 
legal	or	regulatory	fines,	or	the	loss	of	our 	
license to operate critical infrastructure 
services.   
We have a comprehensive incident 
response plan and provide cybersecurity 
awareness training for our employees 
as well as a Crisis Management Plan 
that includes the procedures related to 
cyberattacks (read more in the Crisis 
management section on page 70 ). Our aim 
is to create a security-conscious culture, 
in which all employees take personal 
responsibility for cybersecurity.

Crisis management
Our approach
Besides causing potential harm to people 
and the environment, a crisis could 
potentially interrupt the supply of products 
to customers and harm our business 
through	fines	and	reputational	damage.	
We meet all relevant regulations and have 
established appropriate systems for all 
reasonably foreseeable emergencies. We 
continuously monitor other potential issues 
that could potentially develop into a crisis.  
Emergency	procedures	also	include	fire, 	
flooding,	explosions,	the	exhaust	of	gases, 	
terrorist attacks, extreme weather events 
and	significant	process	disruption	caused 	
by human error. Emergency systems 
include procedures and tools for warning 
people onsite and offsite. We review our 
emergency plans on an annual basis, and 
we conduct regular training to simulate 
various possible incidents.
All our terminal operations conduct 
an annual crisis scenario exercise, 
which	covers	the	management	of	a	fire	
emergency, oil spill, personal injury and 
terrorism. It is coordinated internally by the 
HSSE department and with the assistance 
of external trainers when required. 
When necessary, terminals have 24/7 crisis 
teams,	dedicated	fire	fighters,	emergency 	
control rooms, CCTV, and can initiate 
emergency responses in other locations 
and	coordinate	evacuations.	We	provide	fire	
management training quarterly and annual 
training for all personnel on responding to 
terrorism attacks. 
Progress in 2022
During the year, two large-scale emergency 
exercises were carried out at the Cressier 
manufacturing hub. One event was planned 
with the local authorities and involved the 
simulation of a leakage from our crude oil 
pipeline. The other event was unplanned and 
involved	the	training	scenario	of	a	Liquefied	
Petroleum Gas (LPG) leakage during a 
pipe replacement. We also implemented 
134 additional training sessions for our 
emergency teams that involved over 300 
VARO employees during the year. In 2022, 
investigations	continued	into	the	significant	
incident that involved an explosion and 
fire	that	occurred	at	Bayernoil’s	Vohburg	
site in 2018. Corrective actions arising 
from internal investigations are being 
implemented, and a reinvestment and 
rebuild programme is under way.
Our work in 2023 and beyond
Going	forward,	we	will	continue	to	refine 	
and improve our crisis management 
procedures, and aim to have a 
structured and layered approach to crisis 
management and follow internationally 
recognised standards.
We prepare for various crises related to our 
operations that could potentially harm people and the 
environment or disrupt our business.

Business behaviour 
and ethics
Our approach
The core values that guide our business 
practices centre on honesty, integrity and 
reliability. We expect everyone acting on 
behalf of VARO to abide by our ethical 
business practices – including employees, 
consultants and representatives.
Our Code of Conduct
Our code is a comprehensive set of 
principles related to VARO’s core legal 
standards, our business behaviour and 
ethics. It is publicly available on our 
website. It forms part of the employment 
agreement entered into by every employee 
and is a key part of their induction, on-
boarding and ongoing training. The code 
is available in VARO’s four languages: 
English, Dutch, German and French. It 
is also an integral part of management 
agreements, service agreements and other 
partnerships. VARO’s General Counsel 
and the EVP Integration and Capability are 
custodians of our Code of Conduct. 
Ethical business practices 
In a highly competitive market, we believe 
that conducting business in an ethical 
way is a precondition for maintaining our 
reputation as a trusted partner, and for 
being a successful long-term business. 
We	abide	strictly	by	national	and	EU 	
regulations, and all related international 
sanctions, such as the recent sanctions 
relating to the ban on importing Russian 
crude oil and products. 
VARO employees who engage in 
commercial activities with counterparties 
are trained extensively in compliance with 
national	and	EU	competition	rules,	which	are	
reflected	in	the	VARO	Competition	Rules.	
Data privacy 
We have clear responsibilities for 
safeguarding the personal data of 
individuals – including our employees, 
customers, suppliers and business 
partners. The VARO Privacy Policy aligns 
with the requirements of applicable laws 
and regulations, particularly the General 
Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 
(GDPR). The VARO Data Retention Policy 
regulates the time limit for retaining the 
data of stakeholders stored for various 
purposes. We train and inform employees 
on	safeguarding	confidential	information,	
particularly in relation to the handling 
of computer equipment used for work 
purposes. Read more about cybersecurity 
on page 69.
Our	Conflict	of	Interest	Policy	forms	part 	
of the VARO Code of Conduct, and is 
intended to prevent the risk of personal 
interests. It encourages employees to 
declare if there is any situation that 
could	lead	to	a	conflict	of	interest	in	their 	
performance of work duties. To promote 
an impartial and equitable approach among 
all VARO employees, we have imposed 
a policy of transparency of all personal 
ties between employees and potential 
employees. 
Anti-corruption 
VARO is committed to complying with 
all anti-money laundering and counter-
terrorism	financing	regulations,	which	
are part of our Know Your Customer 
(KYC) Policy. Our approach aims to 
identify, mitigate and manage the risks 
of breaching sanctions, facilitating 
money	laundering,	financing	terrorism,	
or other criminal activity, and exposure 
to bribery and corruption. The VARO 
Credit Risk Department is responsible for 
conducting due diligence and vetting our 
counterparties. 
All business relationships resulting in one or 
more transactions with a total value of over 
15,000	EUR	are	subject 	to	due	diligence.	
There are around 18,000 counterparties 
that abide by our KYC Policy.
Our Whistleblower Policy
Employees can report their concerns 
through our new Whistleblower 
channel, which facilitates employees 
to anonymously report any suspected 
violations of our policies. Employees are 
protected from retaliation.
Advocacy
VARO advocates its values of sustainable 
business, and establishes partnerships and 
co-operation with like-minded partners. 
Our active role in these partnerships 
enables us to exchange best practice 
experience.
One example is our partnership with 
the World Economic Forum, where we 
collaborate with other leading global 
companies to develop solutions to some 
of the	world’s	greatest	challenges.	Another 	
of our important partnerships is with the 
Transhydrogen Alliance, which is working 
to develop the logistics infrastructure 
to facilitate the energy transition. See 
Appendix V on page 107  for a list of 
entities that VARO collaborates with.
Our approach to business behaviour and ethics is 
driven by our Code of Conduct, our ethical business 
practices, data privacy and anti-corruption.

Progress in 2022
By the end of 2022, 84.2% of employees 
had completed our Code of Conduct 
training. We plan to have trained 100% of 
our employees by the end of 2023. 
In 2022, we introduced a Whistleblower 
Policy that provides employees with an 
alternative	channel	to	file	a	complaint 	
related to any issue covered by the Code 
of Conduct.	
In 2022, there were no reported breaches 
of our KYC Policy by our business partners. 
Our work in 2023 and beyond
In 2023, we will review our due diligence 
process for counterparties.

Safeguarding human rights 
Besides our vision to not cause harm to 
people or the environment, our licence to 
operate	is	defined	by	local	communities 	
and the high standards of human rights 
where we operate (read more in the 
section on Local community engagement 
on page 58, and the Health and safety 
section on page 48 ).
Our operations and strategies are aligned 
with universally accepted principles in the 
areas of human rights, labour, environment 
and	anti-corruption,	and	the	UN 	
Sustainable Development Goals. In April 
2022,	we	joined	the	UN	Global	Compact, 	
and will work to ensure that the ten 
principles are fully incorporated throughout 
our corporate practices and value chain. 
All countries where we operate – Belgium, 
France, Germany, Luxembourg, the 
Netherlands, and Switzerland – are ranked 
the highest on the Human Freedom 
Index. This means that our relations with 
employees and society are well regulated 
by local legislation, with high standards 
governing human rights. 
Our Code of Conduct highlights our 
commitment to a workplace environment 
where people are treated with dignity, 
fairness and respect, while our Equity, 
Inclusion and Diversity Policy establishes the 
principles of creating working environments 
based on fair treatment and equality. 
Our grievance mechanism
Our employees have a duty to report in 
good faith any suspected violations of our 
policies. We place strong emphasis on the 
shared obligation to uphold high standards 
of business and personal ethics when 
fulfilling	duties	and	responsibilities.
We provide a channel for reporting 
breaches, which acts as our grievance or 
whistleblowing mechanism. Reporting is 
via email or in-person communication to 
the Human Resources Department and/or 
to the General Counsel. Our Whistleblower 
Policy provides an additional channel for 
grievances, as indicated in the section 
Business behaviour and ethics on page 71 . 
In 2022, we registered three grievances, all 
of which were resolved. 
We seek to safeguard universal human rights by operating 
with respect and by following global best practices in 
relation to our employees, the communities affected by our 
operations, products and services, and our supply chain.

Emission factors for GHGs:
VARO’s GHG calculations are based on a 
number of sources of emission factors: 
• Scope 1: Emissions from our 
manufacturing hubs are calculated 
internally as part of the European 
Emission Trading Scheme.   
• Scope 2: Supplier-based emission 
factors taking account of the product-
specific	allocation	of	electricity 	
production. Emission factors from the 
GHG protocol are used for the residual 
grid and residual mix. 
• Scope 3 category 11 emissions for the 
combustion of sold products are based 
on DEFRA ‘Combustion – Fuels’. 
• Scope 3, category 1 emissions for 
purchased ready-made products are 
based on ‘DEFRA WTT – fuels’.

Consolidation approach  
to GHG emissions
VARO	applies	a	financial	control	approach 	
and seeks to align the extent of its 
GHG	reporting	with	that	of	its	financial 	
statements. VARO owns 51.4% of the 
Bayernoil joint venture manufacturing 
hub. Previously this proportion has 
corresponded to the control of activities 
and GHG emissions. During 2022, 
VARO took over control over additional 
manufacturing rates at Bayernoil and 
updated the consolidation approach to 
also encompass the additional volumes 
and associated emissions. This change 
also led to a restatement of 2021 data. In 
2021, the actual allocation of scope 1 and 
2 emissions was 52.38% – compared to 
56.64% in 2022. 
We have also updated the reporting 
process and emission factor sources for 
Scope 2 calculations retroactively and 
introduced dual reporting with market-
based reporting.

Disclosure on TRIR
Total Recordable Work-related Injury Rate 
(TRIR) is disclosed at a rate of 200,000

Disclosure on Women in Senior 
Management
Senior	management	is	defined	by	VARO’s 	
human resources system as VARO 
employees entering category 6 and above. 
Category 6 includes senior leaders with 
larger departments, some of them covering 
VARO operations in several countries, 
leaders of the leaders of other teams, and 
Senior Project managers.
The percentage of female employees in 
this	category	is	defined	by	share	of	females 	
in senior management.
The calculations are based on the 
headcount of VARO employees.
Where:
• TRI is the weighted average of the 
Total Recordable Injuries, which 
include fatalities, Lost Time Injury 
(LTI), Restricted Work Injury (RWI) and 
Medical Treatment Case (MTC).
• Working hours is estimated as the 
number of hours of work performed  
by employees and contractors.
• 200,000	hours	reflect	100	full-time 	
equivalent employees on a yearly 
basis, based on the assumption they 
work 2,000 hours (250 days) per 
year, as required by the compilation 
requirements of the GRI Disclosure  
403-9 Work-related injuries. 2.1.
Disclosure on Voluntary Employee 
Retention Rate
Voluntary Employee Retention Rate 
includes employees that have terminated 
their contract with VARO on a voluntary 
basis (voluntary attrition). It does not 
include retired VARO employees. It is 
calculated based on the following formula:
Where number of employees is based on 
headcount.

CO2, NOX, SO2, dust and soot. This exhaust, if accumulated 
in the air in certain amounts, may have a negative impact on 
human health. T o decrease these negative impacts, we reduce 
the sulphur content of our products and optimise combustion 
properties through the use of additives, such as Elixir for 
Celsium Premium for Heating Oil, and Elixir for Endura for Diesel 
performance. The main quality regulation for VARO products, 
as required for companies producing and supplying products in 
European Economic Area (EEA) countries, is REACH: Regulation 
(EC) No. 1907/2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, 
Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). VARO’s 
internal process for compiling, handling and communicating 
product information through Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) 
is directed at ensuring compliance with REACH and CLP 
regulations. VARO has around 80 MSDS available for 16 different 
countries, in 14 different languages.

SO2 (Sulphur dioxide) – a colourless, 
pungent gas produced when sulphur is 
burned.
Spill – a spill is an unplanned or uncontrolled 
release of hydrocarbons or chemical 
substances to the ground or water. According 
to the HSSE Management System, any spillage 
of liquid hydrocarbons or other hazardous 
materials on ground or water, or any other 
spillage of such materials shall be recorded as 
an incident and appropriately investigated.
Sulphur – is produced during the 
desulphurisation of JET A-1, diesel, heating 
and petrol oil, and the subsequent Claus 
process. This sulphur is widely used in the 
chemical industry, e.g. for the production 
of sulphuric acid, dyes, insecticides and 
artificial	fertilisers.
Third parties – persons or organisations 
not employed	or	contracted	to	a	company 	
or contractor.
Throughput in manufacturing hub – 
refers to the monthly volume of crude oil 
fed to the crude unit at the processing hub.
Turnaround/shutdown – a scheduled 
event in which production from process 
units is stopped for an extended period 
(e.g.	1-2	months)	for maintenance, 	
inspection, revamp and/or renewal of the 
equipment.
Vacuum distillation – in crude oil 
distillation, crude oil is distilled under 
atmospheric pressure. All components 
of the crude oil (gas, petrol, petroleum, 
and gasoil) are recovered as long as 
their boiling point is below a working 
temperature of around 350°C. If the crude 
oil was to be heated more, its molecules 
would start cracking. Other distillates 
are recovered at only slightly higher 
temperatures,	but	at	significantly	lower 	
pressure (vacuum). The lightest fraction is 
vacuum gasoil, and the heaviest fraction 
is	processed	into	bitumen	or heavy 	
heating oil.

Assurance statement
    
    
Limited assurance report of the independent 
auditor on VARO Energy B.V.’s selected 
information in the ESG report 2022
To: the management board of VARO Energy B.V. 
Our conclusion
We have performed a limited assurance engagement on selected indicators and selected 
disclosures relating to the materiality analysis (hereafter: the selected information) in the 
ESG report 2022 of VARO Energy B.V. at Rotterdam.
Based on our procedures performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our 
attention that causes us to believe that the selected information is not prepared, in all 
material respects, in accordance with the reporting criteria as included in the Reporting 
criteria section of our report.
The selected indicators consist of:
•    Percentage of electricity generated from renewable sources at the Cressier 
manufacturing hub and the terminals in Switzerland for 2022 on page 33 of the 
ESG report
•     Scope 1 CO2 emissions for 2022 on page 34 of the ESG report
•    Scope 2 CO2 emissions (both market based as location based) for 2022 on page 34 
of the ESG report
•    Scope 3.11 CO2 emissions (Use of sold products) for 2022 on page 34 of the ESG report
•    Total recordable injury rate (TRIR) for 2022 on page 48 of the ESG report
•    Percentage of female senior managers for 2022 on page 53 of the ESG report
•    Voluntary employee retention rate for 2022 on page 55 of the ESG report
Basis for our conclusion
We have performed our limited assurance engagement on the selected information in 
accordance with Dutch law, including Dutch Standard 3000A Assurance-opdrachten anders 
dan opdrachten tot controle of beoordeling van historische financiële informatie (attest-
opdrachten) (Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial 
information (attestation engagements)). Our responsibilities under this standard are further 
described in the “Our responsibilities for the assurance engagement on the selected 
information” section of our report.
We are independent of VARO Energy B.V. in accordance with the “Verordening inzake de 
onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten” (ViO, Code of Ethics for 
Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence). This includes that we 
do not perform any activities that could result in a conflict of interest with our independent 
assurance engagement. Furthermore, we have complied with the “Verordening gedrags- en 
beroepsregels accountants”
(VGBA, Dutch code of ethics).
We believe that the assurance evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our conclusion.
Reporting criteria
The reporting criteria used for the preparation of the selected information are the reporting 
criteria developed by VARO Energy B.V. and are disclosed in appendix I Our ESG report on 
pages 76 up to and including 79 of the ESG report.
The absence of an established practice on which to draw, to evaluate and measure the 
selected information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques and can 
affect comparability between entities and over time. Consequently, the selected information 
needs to be read and understood together with the reporting criteria used.
Unassured corresponding information
No assurance engagement has been performed on the selected information for the period 
prior to 2022. Consequently, the corresponding selected information and thereto related 
disclosures for the period before 2022 is not assured.
Limitations to the scope of our assurance engagement
Our assurance engagement is restricted to the selected information. We have not 
performed assurance procedures on any other information as included in the ESG report 
in light of this engagement.
The selected information includes prospective information such as ambitions, strategy, 
plans, expectations and estimates. Inherent to prospective information, the actual 
future results are uncertain. We do not provide any assurance on the assumptions and 
achievability of prospective information in the selected information.
The references to external sources or websites are not part of our assurance engagement 
on the selected information. We therefore do not provide assurance on this information.

Our conclusion is not modified in respect of these matters.
Responsibilities of the management board and the supervisory board for the 
selected information
The management board is responsible for the preparation of the selected information 
in accordance with the reporting criteria as included in the Reporting criteria section of 
our report. The management board is solely responsible for selecting and applying these 
reporting criteria, taking into account applicable law and regulations related to reporting. 
In this context, the management board is responsible for the identification of the intended 
users and the criteria being applicable for their purposes. The choices made by the 
management board regarding the scope of the selected information and the reporting 
policy are summarized in appendix I Our ESG report on page 76 of the ESG report.
Furthermore, the management board is responsible for such internal control as it 
determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the selected information that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the reporting process of the selected 
information of VARO Energy B.V.
 
Our responsibilities for the assurance engagement on the selected information
Our responsibility is to plan and perform our limited assurance engagement in a manner 
that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate assurance evidence for our conclusion.
Procedures performed to obtain a limited level of assurance are aimed to determine the 
plausibility of information and vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent, than 
for a reasonable assurance engagement. The level of assurance obtained in a limited 
assurance engagement is therefore substantially less than the assurance obtained in a 
reasonable assurance engagement.
We apply the Nadere voorschriften kwaliteitssystemen (NVKS, Regulations for quality 
management systems) and accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality 
control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical 
requirements, professional standards and other relevant legal and regulatory requirements.
The procedures of our limited assurance engagement included among others:
•    Performing an analysis of the external environment and obtaining an understanding 
of the sector , insight into relevant sustainability themes and issues, relevant laws and 
regulations and the characteristics of the company as far as relevant to the selected 
information.
•    Evaluating the appropriateness of the reporting criteria used, their consistent 
application and related disclosures on the selected information. This includes the 
evaluation of the reasonableness of estimates made by the management board.
•    Obtaining through inquiries a general understanding of internal control, reporting 
processes and information systems relevant to the preparation of the selected 
information, without obtaining evidence about implementation or testing the operating 
effectiveness of controls.
•    Identifying areas of the selected information with a higher risk of misleading or 
unbalanced information or material misstatements, whether due to error or fraud. 
Designing and performing further assurance procedures aimed at determining the 
plausibility of the selected information responsive to this risk analysis. These further 
assurance procedures consisted amongst others of:
 -    Interviewing management and relevant staff at corporate and business level 
responsible for the strategy, policy and results relating to the selected information
 -     Interviewing relevant staff responsible for providing the information for , carrying out 
internal control procedures on, and consolidating the data in the selected information
 -    Obtaining assurance information that the selected information reconciles with 
underlying records of the company
 -    Reviewing, on a limited test basis, relevant internal and external documentation
 -    Performing an analytical review of the data and trends in the information submitted 
for consolidation at corporate level
 -    Reading the information in the ESG report which is not included in the scope of our 
assurance engagement to identify material inconsistencies, if any, with the selected 
information.
