The IKEA business1 has come 
a long way since its foundation 
in the 1940s in the rugged 
landscape of Småland, southern 
Sweden. It’s the story of a 
brand that has enabled millions 
of people to create a better 
everyday life. Today, the IKEA 
Brand is well known around  
the world.    
Almost 200,000 people work for different IKEA 
companies, and around one million people are 
employed by IKEA suppliers. The IKEA business 
is operated through a franchise system. Together 
with customers, co-workers, franchisees and other 
partners, we want to be a good example of how 
much you can achieve by working together and 
trying to be a force for good.
The IKEA vision and values guide us in how we 
work across the IKEA business. That includes caring 
for people and the planet. Making more from less 
and finding new, creative ways to deal with limited 
resources are part of the IKEA way of working. 
Today, this is more important than ever as the world 
faces huge challenges such as climate change, 
increasing inequality and unsustainable consumption.
 We can and will.
 always.work to have.
 a positive impact..

Recycled plastics and materials
 n   Globa lly, there are not enough clean recycled 
materials. This has slowed our transition towards 
using more recycled materials in products. We  
will continue to increase our focus on securing 
recycled plastics and materials in our supply  
chain going forward. 
Fair wages and working 
conditions 
n   D ecent working conditions are fundamental  
for good business. And we have come a long way 
in improving our supply chain using IWAY – our 
supplier code of conduct. Today, many people are 
migrating around the world. This increases the risk 
of unfair employment practices, specifically  
in certain regions and industries. In response,  
we are increasing our efforts to define and secure 
decent work across our supply chain. 
Tackling climate change is a 
challenge we all share
n   As a growing business and large user of raw 
materials, a key challenge for the IKEA business 
is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in  
absolute terms.

The world is changing, and the 
IKEA business is changing with it. 
But one thing will always remain 
the same: our vision to create  
a better everyday life for the 
many people.   
This vision guides us every day. Around the world,  
we continue our efforts to inspire people with 
affordable and sustainable products and solutions. 
And we aspire to create a positive impact on people, 
society and the planet. To make these ambitions a 
reality, the IKEA business will continue to develop  
and grow.
Growth for us means expanding our vision to even 
more of the many people. We will only be successful 
when we succeed to create a better world, which 
is why sustainability is a key focus for the IKEA 
business. Along with affordability and accessiblility, 
sustainabililty is one of our main priorities under the 
IKEA direction for the future.
Today the IKEA range is more affordable and 
sustainable than ever before. I am convinced  
that sustainability and good design can be affordable 
for the many. In FY17, we introduced the RYET LED 
bulb in most markets at a price of around one euro, 
enabling more people to save energy and money. 
This is an important achievement, and it’s vital that 
we continue to make our products more affordable 
as we expand and enable people to live a more 
sustainable life.
We continue to develop partnerships beyond the 
IKEA business. Our aim is to co-create solutions to 
society’s challenges with those who share our values 
and ambitions. We want to be clear and outspoken 
about our point of view on challenges that are 
important to people, and lead by example  
to influence change.
One example is our social entrepreneurship 
programme, where we partner with social enterprises 
to develop limited edition products and collections. 
These collaborations provide employment for  
people in underprivileged communities close to the 
IKEA value chain. It’s one way we contribute to 
lasting change for the many people together with 
IKEA customers.
The IKEA business is operated through a franchise 
system. It was simplified and improved when 
the range, supply and production activities were 
transferred to Inter IKEA Group and brought closer 
to the IKEA franchisor. FY17 was the first year we 
worked together in the new structure. This new 
set-up will help us to clarify and consolidate our 
sustainability ambitions across the whole IKEA 
franchise system and value chain. We are many 
companies united under one brand and with a 
common and strong sustainability agenda.
In 2018, we will introduce the next big steps for the 
IKEA business: focusing on inspiring healthy and 
sustainable living for the many people, transforming 
the way we work to become circular and climate 
positive, and promoting a fair and equal world for 
the many people we impact across the value chain. 
Transforming into a circular business is one of our 
biggest ambitions and opportunities for the future. 
We are just at the beginning, and most things 
remain to be done. But I am optimistic and excited 
about the future, and we will continue to work 
together throughout the IKEA value chain. We will 
do this together with our co-workers, partners and 
customers, and step by step we will contribute to 
making the world a better place to live in.

IKEA is a global brand with  
many co-workers and businesses 
around the world. With our  
creativity, innovation, knowledge 
in life at home and shared  
values, we have a great and 
unique opportunity to be a  
good example for positive  
change in society.   
Over the years we have come a long way towards 
transforming the IKEA business to become more 
sustainable. The world is rapidly changing but we 
remain optimistic about the future and we are as 
committed as ever to creating a better everyday  
life for the many people and to being People &  
Planet Positive.
Our aim is to create real change, always guided by 
the IKEA vision and values to care for people and the 
planet. Our approach is to lead with facts and always 
challenge old truths. We work long-term as many of 
the positive changes we want to see will take time.  
Forestry is one example of the way we work. Our 
commitment, to source 100% of the wood we 
use from more sustainable materials (FSC and 
recycled sources) requires a transformation not 
only of the IKEA business, but also across the entire 
industry. The IKEA forestry teams must increase 
the availability of certified wood – there simply isn’t 
enough. In FY17, 77% of the wood sourced for use 
in IKEA products came from sources defined as more 
sustainable. It’s a big step because forestry is so  
vital to the IKEA business.
But beyond wood products, every one of the  
9,500 IKEA products is developed through our 
Democratic Design approach where sustainability  
is a key dimension. Together with IKEA franchisees, 
we are focusing not only on ensuring that we  
source sustainable materials, but also that we 
consider products throughout their lifecycle. 
Our ambition is to become a circular business. 
We have just started this journey, but we’re making 
progress that you can already see in the IKEA product 
range. The KUNGSBACKA kitchen cabinet doors, for 
example, are made from recycled plastic and recycled 
wood. It’s a huge achievement, especially in kitchens 
where the products are made from multiple materials 
that must be clean, tough and long lasting – we 
guarantee our kitchen cabinets for 25 years.
While our choice of materials and how we design and 
create products are crucial, people are at the heart 
of everything we do. To reach our goals we must 
work together, nurturing a culture of innovation, 
collaboration and an entrepreneurial spirit across 
the value chain. We must also be fair and inclusive, 
continuing to create responsible supply chains 
with fair wages, good working practices, ethical 
recruitment of migrant workers, supporting craft 
workers and providing opportunities for smallholders 
and social entrepreneurs. 
I’m extremely proud of our work within the 
handmade carpets industry in India, for example. 
Together with our suppliers we have created a whole 
new industry set-up employing 850 women: that’s 
850 more women empowered by decent work. 
Only by challenging ourselves and setting ambitions 
and commitments that are larger than what we can 
achieve alone will we create an even bigger positive 
impact. The updated IKEA sustainability strategy, 
which will be communicated during 2018, is created 
to do just that: with new ambitions, guided by the 
UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, that push us 
and enable us to prepare for the world of 2030 and 
beyond. And by working with others, I’m confident 
that together we will create a positive impact.

This is IKEA
IKEA: one brand – many 
companies
The IKEA business is operated through a 
franchise system. That means many companies 
with different owners work under the IKEA 
trademark. All work towards the shared IKEA 
vision – to create a better everyday life for the 
many people – which guides every decision.
The IKEA business idea is to offer a wide 
range of well-designed, functional home 
furnishing products at prices so low that as 
many people as possible will be able to afford 
them. The IKEA retail business is operated 
by independent franchisees under franchise 
agreement with Inter IKEA Systems B.V. 
(see simplified overview). Through the IKEA 
business and together with IKEA franchisees, 
we can make sustainable solutions affordable 
to the many people.  
Inter IKEA Group
The overall purpose of Inter IKEA Group is to 
secure continuous improvement, development, 
expansion, innovation and a long life for the 
IKEA Concept. Inter IKEA is composed of three 
core businesses:
n   
Franchising – Inter IKEA Systems B.V. is 
the worldwide IKEA franchisor and owner 
of the IKEA Concept. The day-to-day retail 
business is run by 11 independent groups 
of franchisees. Inter IKEA Systems B.V. 
is responsible for providing franchisees 
with the best possible conditions for 
implementing and operating the IKEA 
Concept, and to creating a strong platform  
for sustainable growth.
n  
 Develo
ping and supplying the IKEA 
range – IKEA Range & Supply is responsible 
for designing and supplying the global IKEA 
range. This means working throughout 
the whole value chain – from supplier to 
customer. IKEA Range & Supply includes: 
IKEA of Sweden AB, IKEA Communications 
AB, IKEA Food Services AB, IKEA Supply 
AG and related businesses. All work under 
assignment from Inter IKEA Systems B.V.  
n   
Production – IKEA Industry manufactures 
IKEA home furnishing products and 
produces approximately 10-12% of the total 
IKEA range, with its main focus on furniture. 
It is the largest producer of wooden 
furniture in the world.

About this report
This is the first sustainability report of Inter 
IKEA Group. It summarises performance during 
FY17 covering the IKEA product and food range, 
supply, production and franchising. To clarify 
roles and improve the franchise system, IKEA 
range, supply and production activities were 
transferred to Inter IKEA Group from INGKA 
Holding B.V. on 31 August 2016. INGKA Holding 
B.V. is the largest group of IKEA franchisees 
with 355 stores in 29 markets (in FY17). The 
commitments made by IKEA Range & Supply 
and IKEA Industry under the INGKA Holding 
B.V. ownership have remained applicable during 
FY17 in the new Inter IKEA Group structure. In 
previous years, sustainability performance of 
IKEA Range & Supply and IKEA Industry was 
reported in the INGKA Holding B.V. sustainability 
reports. For information on sustainability 
performance across INGKA Holding B.V., please 
see the INGKA Holding B.V. Sustainability 
Summary Report FY17. Find out more at  
ikea.com.
This report follows the structure of the People 
& Planet Positive 2020 strategy, which was 
launched by INGKA Holding B.V. in 2012.  
It focuses on three drivers of change:
n   Healthy and sustainable living –  
providing the products, services and 
inspiration that enable people to live more 
sustainable and healthy lives.
n   Resources and energy – transforming 
the IKEA operations to be as resource  
efficient as possible, generating and using 
renewable energy, and sourcing the materials 
for our products responsibly.
n   People and communities – creating a 
positive impact for the people across the  
IKEA value chain – from the co-workers in  
our stores to the cotton farmers we source 
from and the communities around us.  
For an overview of commitments, targets and 
indicators made in the People and Planet Positive 
2020 strategy, see page 47. 
The financial year 2017 (FY17) of Inter IKEA 
Group is from 1 September 2016 to 31 August 
2017. Throughout this report, “Inter IKEA 
Group” is referred to as “Inter IKEA”. 
For information on the financial performance of 
Inter IKEA Group in FY17, including taxes, see 
the Inter IKEA Group Financial Summary.
This is an interim year. During 2018, Inter IKEA 
Systems B.V. will launch the updated IKEA 
sustainability strategy – People & Planet Positive 
- with new ambitions and commitments for the 
whole franchise system and value chain leading 
up to 2030. 
Data
Inter IKEA Group’s reporting and data collection 
processes involve many internal and external 
stakeholders. Our climate and energy footprints 
are calculated in accordance with the GHG 
Protocol Corporate Standard and respective 
guidance documents.
We strive to use primary data where possible, 
and only use secondary data where necessary. 
Primary data is used for all scope 1 and 2 
emissions, 1st tier suppliers and product use 
footprint. Energy-related information is obtained 
from real-time meters at each site, invoices or 
transport providers.
Emission categories of raw materials and food 
ingredients use footprint factors provided by 
Quantis using the Ecoinvent database and 
proxies where lifecycle assessment data is not 
available.
Reported data may be affected by uncertainties 
in scientific knowledge or in the contextual data 
used in calculations, especially for scope 3. We 
use the most up-to-date emission factors from 
publicly available sources like the International 
Energy Agency and DEFRA, and from local 
electricity and heat suppliers. 
 
 
We aim to ensure all information and data  
are relevant, transparent, consistent, accurate 
and complete, and that they provide an 
objective picture of Inter IKEA Group operations. 
The data in this report covers Inter IKEA Group 
operations. Data for each franchisee is not 
covered within the scope of this report.  
Any exclusion is stated in the report.

Homes and the way people live 
have a huge impact on health 
and wellbeing, and on the planet. 
Households account for one-third 
of global energy use and one- 
tenth of water use.   
People are already searching for solutions that 
enable them to live healthier and more sustainable 
lives, and to conserve resources by prolonging the 
life of the things they own. At the same time, the 
world around us is changing. Population growth and 
urbanisation mean more people are living in smaller 
spaces with limited access to nature. 
With billions of visitors to IKEA stores and  
IKEA.com, together we have a huge opportunity 
to lead by example. Across the global IKEA 
business there is a lot of knowledge about life at 
home. This enables us to offer the knowledge, 
ideas and affordable solutions that make healthy 
and sustainable living desirable. And by working 
together with partners across the IKEA business, we 
will enable and inspire people to become part of a 
sharing and circular economy.

Developing 
a healthier 
and more 
sustainable 
range
Healthy and  
sustainable living products
The IKEA healthy and sustainable product 
range enables customers to:
SAVE ENERGY 
LED bulbs use up to 85% less energy than 
traditional incandescent bulbs, and last for 
up to 20 years. But transformational change 
will only happen if solutions like LED lighting 
are accessible to the many people. That’s why 
IKEA LED RYET lightbulbs are available for just 
€0.99.1 In FY17, IKEA customers purchased 
over 91 million LED bulbs. And by only offering 
LED lighting in the IKEA product range, in  
FY17 IKEA customers were able to reduce  
their energy consumption around the globe  
by 3.3 billion kWh.2
REDUCE AND SORT WASTE 
Sorting household waste for recycling means 
materials like plastic, paper and metal can be 
turned from waste into a resource. Products 
like VARIERA bins make waste sorting easy. 
They’re easy to carry, lock in odours and can 
be customised to fit any space. Enabling all 
Around 2,000 new IKEA products are launched 
every year, contributing to the range of 
more than 9,500 products. All are designed 
according to the five dimensions of Democratic 
Design (see right). This means products 
have both sustainable functions and built-in 
sustainability. Read more about how materials 
are sourced on page 18, and the approach 
to becoming a resource-efficient and circular 
business on page 17.
Many IKEA products are also specifically 
designed to enable people to live healthier 
and more sustainable lives at home. There are 
over 500 IKEA products with specific health or 
sustainability functions. These products focus 
on improving water and energy efficiency, 
generating renewable energy, sorting waste 
and living a healthier life.   
homes to treat waste as a resource is part  
of moving towards a circular society. 
SAVE WATER 
Many IKEA taps combine pressure-
compensating aerators and cold-start 
functions, which save water and energy.  
And water-efficient dishwashers, like LAGAN, 
use less water than handwashing, saving  
time and money. Innovations in water-
efficiency will become increasingly important  
in a water-scarce world. 
ACCESS CLEAN AIR
We’re looking into many solutions for 
improving air quality, such as material 
innovations and green plants. In the home, 
burning cooking fuels causes air pollution, 
so we’ve invested in reducing the price of 
induction hobs to make them more accessible. 
And they’re more efficient – the affordable 
TILLREDA portable hob is 40% more energy 
efficient than conventional hobs.

13 |  INTER IKEA SUSTAINABILITY SUMMARY REPORT
At Inter IKEA, we want to build on the healthy 
and sustainability product offer, and together with 
IKEA franchisees use influence and knowledge of 
life at home to enable IKEA customers to change 
their lifestyles. Over the years, a lot of research 
has been done across the IKEA business into how 
people live in different markets, such as the IKEA 
Life at Home report. And a tool is being developed 
to consolidate this knowledge. By learning 
more, we can create the products, services and 
inspiration to make healthy and sustainable living 
part of the everyday. 
Stimulating play for healthy 
and sustainable living
Every child has the right to play. It’s vital to their 
development, and for a better everyday life at 
home. In FY17, the third IKEA Play Report was 
published – investigating what encourages play in 
both children and adults across different markets. 
It found that play is used across cultures as a 
tool to sustain a healthy life, and it encourages 
creativity and happiness. These findings will 
support us in our ambition to inspire and enable 
more playful everyday lives. 
Examples of IKEA products that enable children to 
develop healthy and sustainable behaviours that 
they can bring into adulthood are:
n  
 PLUFSIG fo
lding gym mat is perfect for 
children to get active and develop their motor 
and coordination skills. And it neatly folds away 
when play time is over. 
n  
 DUKTIG so
ft toy vegetable set encourages 
children to develop a positive relationship with 
healthy and sustainable foods. 
Healthy and 
sustainable 
food
Food is at the heart of everyday life, and 660 
million people experienced the IKEA Food offer in 
FY17. IKEA Food aims to create a healthier and 
more sustainable food offer that’s both delicious 
and affordable, and encourages a positive 
relationship with food. We are making progress 
towards this ambition, but we acknowledge that 
many things still remain to be done. 
There are many barriers to eating a healthy and 
sustainable diet – such as cost, convenience, 
or enjoyment. But eating good food is vital to a 
healthy life, and it shouldn’t be the second-best 
option or unaffordable for people with thin wallets. 
The IKEA Food range follows the principles of 
Democratic Design (see page 12), and new food 
products should score highly in all five dimensions. 
Good food starts with good ingredients, so in FY17 
IKEA Food started working with nutrition experts 
to develop guidance on the ingredients to be 
encouraged, limited and avoided in food product 
development. And we will continue to assess the 
nutritional value of IKEA meals and food products 
against the Balanced Meal standard.

A circular 
offer
Transforming IKEA into a “circular” business 
is a big ambition and challenge for the future. 
It will impact the business in all aspects: from 
how products and services are developed, 
materials sourced, the IKEA supply chain 
developed and logistics set up to how 
customers are met. 
During FY16 a global piece of research was 
conducted to find out why customers choose to 
keep things or throw them away. Functionality 
and an emotional connection to products are 
key factors, as well as condition, style, and 
quality. These findings were used in FY17 
to further develop the IKEA circular design 
principles. All product development teams 
are being trained on how to implement these 
principles to fulfil the ambition for every 
product in the IKEA range to have circular 
capabilities, such as being designed for easy 
care, repair and recyclability. 
It’s not waste,  
it’s a resource 
That’s the attitude a product development 
team took with leftover PET bottles 
and wood. The result? A beautiful new 
KUNGSBACKA kitchen front, made from 
recycled materials, launched in FY17. 
Today, recycled materials are used in 
many IKEA products. But to make a true 
transformation and a real impact, recycled 
materials must be used as any other 
material in our large volume products.  
In FY17, we did research to learn how  
we can further integrate recycled materials 
into IKEA products.
Recovering sofas using  
the waste hierarchy
All sofas recovered with takeback services 
are dealt with using the waste hierarchy see 
page 32. Where possible, sofas are given 
a second life through resale, with repairs 
made where necessary. If they’re beyond 
repair, the aim is to recycle them. Where 
the infrastructure doesn’t exist, sofas are 
incinerated and energy is recovered where 
possible.

Services for product repair 
and recycling
To support IKEA customers to prolong the 
life of their products, we provide more than a 
million spare parts for products every year.
Furniture takeback services are offered at a 
growing number of IKEA stores. For example, 
at IKEA stores in Japan, customers can sell 
back their old furniture for resale in store.  
Within the first six months of launching in 
FY17, around 1,900 second-hand items were 
returned and 1,600 were repaired, refurbished 
and resold. Please see the INGKA Holding B.V. 
Sustainability Summary report FY17.
Sofa and mattress takeback services are 
offered in around two-thirds of IKEA retail 
markets, with more markets to follow in FY18. 
Delivering takeback services is an ambitious 
challenge, especially in markets with limited 
recycling infrastructure. In FY17, markets 
that have overcome obstacles of limited 
infrastructure shared their knowledge to help 
remaining markets roll out takeback services. 
For example, IKEA Indonesia partnered with 
the local charity organisation Yayasan Yasmin 
to deliver takeback services.

Putting safety first
Chemicals
Chemical substances are useful in making 
many IKEA products – they bring beautiful 
colours and texture to materials, glue parts 
together, and can provide a protective layer to 
make products last longer.
All chemicals used in or for making IKEA 
products should be safe for customers and 
co-workers. And our standards often go 
beyond legal requirements, phasing out 
chemicals that are suspected of being harmful 
or causing allergic reactions. For example, 
we are continuously working to lower levels 
of formaldehydes in wood-based materials by 
working with suppliers and sub-suppliers to 
improve sourcing and production techniques. 
The aim is that formaldehyde emission levels 
in IKEA wood-based products will be reduced 
to the same level as natural wood. 
The IKEA Chemical Strategy is updated 
regularly to reflect changing demands and  
new evidence on the hazards of different 
chemicals. Based on the strategy, our aim is  
to create safe and healthy products through 
five strategic objectives:
n  
 Increasing 
information on chemical  
content in products
n  
 Assessing a
ll IKEA products for  
chemical safety
n  
 Phasing out 
substances that could  
cause harm
n  
 Ensuring suppliers share IKEA
 values  
on chemical safety and compliance
n  
 Increasing 
awareness among co-workers, 
consumers, and key stakeholders.  
IKEA product safety
Product safety is a top priority. Risk 
assessments are conducted throughout the 
IKEA product design and production processes. 
Product testing processes ensure compliance 
with all relevant IKEA requirements, which in 
many cases exceed legislation. And action is 
taken to correct problems with any products 
that don’t live up to high safety standards. 
If we find an immediate safety risk for IKEA 
customers we will act with our strongest tool 
– to recall the product. We will not hesitate 
to take such action – the safety of customers 
simply comes first. 
 
T
ragically, tip-over accidents are an industry-
wide problem, and have happened with IKEA 
furniture. Attaching furniture to the wall is key 
to preventing these accidents. The ‘Secure 
it!’ campaign, launched by IKEA franchisees 
in FY16, further raised awareness about 
prevention, and urges customers to follow  
the assembly instructions carefully. Customers 
who have misplaced their tip-over restraint  
can order replacements online or pick them  
up from any IKEA store, free of charge.  
co-createIKEA
The IKEA business is opening up 
to be even more inclusive and 
democratic, including with the way 
IKEA products and solutions are 
developed. The aim is to build a 
global community of co-creators, all 
working towards the shared vision 
of creating a better everyday life 
for the many people. This includes 
working with innovation labs, start-
ups and universities, both online 
and in physical co-create labs.
co-createIKEA labs
As part of co-createIKEA,  
pop-up labs will bring together 
businesses, universities, NGOs 
and entrepreneurs with the many 
people, to explore the big problems 
of affordability, accessibility and 
sustainability. The labs will move 
every six to twelve months to the 
best hot-spots around the world for 
solving the big problems, drawing 
on local ideas and solutions. 
IKEA Bootcamp
In partnership with Rainmaking, 
a global cooperative of 
entrepreneurs, the IKEA Bootcamp 
programme aims to engage start-
up businesses to explore new ways 
to reach the many people with 
smart products and services that 
have a positive impact on people 
and planet.
At the launch in FY17, there were 
over 1,200 applications from 86 
countries. Ten teams were selected 
(above) to receive mentoring 
and workshops from Inter IKEA 
co-workers. At the end of the 
programme they pitched their  
ideas to investors and Inter IKEA 
co-workers.

 resources.
Climate change and resource 
scarcity are already impacting 
the IKEA business and affecting 
the lives of people throughout 
the IKEA value chain. To become 
people and planet positive, 
we must continue to source 
our materials responsibly, use 
resources more efficiently and 
dramatically reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions. We will do all this 
while growing the IKEA business, 
by decoupling material use 
from growth. One of the biggest 
ambitions for the future is to 
transform today’s IKEA business 
into a circular operation, built 
on clean, renewable energy and 
regenerative resources.  

Page 17:
17 |  INTER IKEA SUSTAINABILITY SUMMARY REPORT
Tackling 
climate 
change
Climate change is one of the biggest 
challenges facing humanity. The signing of 
the Paris Climate Agreement in 2016 was a 
big step towards coordinated global action to 
limit the global temperature increase to 2°C, 
aiming for 1.5°C, by the end of the century. 
We fully support this milestone, and are 
developing targets for the IKEA business in 
line with the Paris commitment. 
Leading by example is one of the core IKEA 
values. That’s why, together with customers, 
franchisees, suppliers and partners, we will 
demonstrate leadership to tackle climate 
change – going beyond our own footprint.  
We will continue to focus on energy 
efficiency, renewable energy, renewable fuels 
& materials and circularity. The greatest 
influence we can have is in developing 
products that are made from sustainable 
materials and that enable customers to live 
sustainably (see page 12). Making more from 
less and being entrepreneurial have always 
been cornerstones of the IKEA philosophy.
Transforming the IKEA business to become 
circular is an ambition that impacts the 
entire value chain – from how we design 
and create products, source materials, 
develop the IKEA supply chain and set 
up logistics, to how and where we meet 
customers. Across the IKEA business, waste 
is already seen as a valuable resource, and 
products are considered material banks 
for the future, with the potential to be 
transformed into secondary materials. And 
we are exploring new materials and ways to 
prolong the lives of products and materials. 
Throughout the IKEA business, we are 
working, together with partners, towards 
a circular offer for customers (see page 
14) – thinking differently about resources, 
materials and waste, while inspiring  
other organisations and individuals  
to do the same. 
We are at the beginning of the journey, but 
the ambition of the IKEA business is to: 
n   Enable customers to be part of the 
solution – We work to understand 
people’s needs and the problems facing 
consumers around the world – from 
how we acquire things, to how we retain 
and restore value in the things we love 
and get rid of things we no longer want, 
exploring opportunities to address these 
problems. Together with franchisees, 
we offer spare parts and fittings for all 
IKEA products. And there are over 100 
local initiatives that contribute towards 
learning about the circular economy  
(see page 14).
n   Create a complete offer of products  
– designed with circular capabilities.  
A set of circular design principles have 
been developed as the way for us to 
ensure that all products within the IKEA 
range will  fulfill our ambition to become 
fully circular. It’s about designing all our 
products from the very beginning to be 
repurposed, repaired, reused, resold and 
recycled, generating as little waste as 
possible. The ambition is for the circular 
design principles to be a guideline for 
every product that is developed. Some 
IKEA products already have some of 
these circular capabilities built in (see 
pages 14 and 25). 
n   Improve resource utilisation 
throughout the value chain – using 
only renewable or recycled materials, or 
both, and turning waste into resources  
to ensure that nothing goes to landfill 
(see pages 25 and 32).

Responsible 
sourcing
We always aim to source the raw materials 
for IKEA products in a responsible way 
– developing standards that include 
environmental, social and animal welfare 
criteria. All of the materials we use to make 
IKEA products are part of our responsible 
sourcing agenda. We constantly work to 
improve this agenda – regularly reviewing 
definitions and standards and updating them 
as applicable as part of the process to make 
responsible sourcing the norm across the IKEA 
business and beyond. For the materials we 
use the most, like wood and cotton, we focus 
in particular on meeting recognised standards 
for more sustainable sourcing. In FY17, 77% 
of the wood and 100% of the cotton sourced 
for use in IKEA products came from sources 
defined as more sustainable.1 
Wood and paper
We love wood because it is long-lasting, 
renewable, recyclable and beautiful. It’s also 
versatile, and as well as being used to make 
furniture, it can be transformed into textiles, 
plastics, and fuels. But we know that forests 
are complex ecosystems that need to be 
protected and well-managed. As a large user 
of wood, sourcing from over 50 countries, 
the IKEA business can have a significant 
impact on the world’s forests and the timber 
industry. That’s why we place sustainable 
forest management at the core of our business 
– working to eliminate forest degradation and 
deforestation and promoting its importance 
beyond our own value chain. We are always 
looking for innovative ways to manage, 
protect, restore and regenerate forests. 
Making more from less is part of the IKEA 
culture. That’s why every piece of wood is cut 
and shaped to minimise unnecessary waste in 
production. And we look for new and smarter 
ways to design and build our furniture to 
ensure the best possible product with  
minimum impact on the planet. In FY17,  
we used 16.5 million m3 of roundwood  
equivalent (RWE) in our products. For the first 
time, this figure also includes the paper we 
use, which makes up 582,000 m3 of the total.
We want to become forest positive, 
contributing well beyond our own needs to 
make responsible forestry the norm, transform 
the industry and drive societal change. We will 
do this by continuing to promote responsible 
forestry, and working to eliminate forest 
degradation and deforestation.
All of the wood used in IKEA products is 
sourced in compliance with the IKEA IWAY 
Forestry Section,  working towards the aim 
of sourcing 100% from more sustainable 
sources (Forest Stewardship Council® – FSC® 
– certified or recycled) by 2020. In FY17 we 
reached 77%, maintaining our position as the 
world’s biggest user of FSC certified wood. 
But we are starting to reach the limits of 
the availability of FSC certified wood in the 
countries we source from.
Today, 75% of the wood we use comes from 
low-risk2 places such as most EU countries and 
the US. The remainder needs to be sourced 
from countries where there is currently a 
higher risk of non-sustainable practices, such 
as China, Romania, Russia and Vietnam. Since 
September 2016, all of the wood we source 
from these countries has been from more 
sustainable sources. Achieving this required 
hard work and collaboration from our forestry 
teams, suppliers, their partners and IKEA 
forestry partnerships around the world. To 
reach our target of securing 100% of our wood 
from more sustainable sources by 2020, we 
need to scale up our forest-positive work and 
think even bigger.

19 |  INTER IKEA SUSTAINABILITY SUMMARY REPORT
Across the IKEA business, we partner with 
NGOs and other businesses to increase the 
global supply of wood from more sustainable 
sources. Together with WWF and others, the 
IKEA business has helped to combat illegal 
logging and promote the responsible timber 
trade – from five forest projects in seven 
countries in 2002, to collaborations today  
in 14 countries on a variety of projects.  
The partnership with WWF helps to increase 
commitments, actions, transparency, and 
leadership among companies, communities, 
and consumers, benefiting both people  
and the environment.
This work includes responsible certification, 
one part of which is mapping and protecting 
High Conservation Value Forests to secure 
ecological and social forest values. So far,  
the collaboration with WWF has helped to 
improve forest management in Europe and 
Asia, and contributed to increasing FSC 
certified forest areas by around 35 million 
hectares – roughly the size of Germany –  
in the target countries.

INCLUDING SMALLHOLDER FARMERS 
IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND USING 
NEW MATERIALS 
Smallholder farmers are a vital source of  
wood, and we want to help them be included  
in responsible sourcing programmes. We  
work with them to scale up the production 
of new materials such as bamboo, acacia 
and rattan. These materials are versatile, 
strong and fast growing, making them a 
great renewable resource. Smallholders 
often experience challenges to achieving 
internationally-recognised certifications  
such as FSC, which can be expensive and 
complicated. A number of projects aim  
to tackle this.
n  
 In Thailand
, we partner with WWF to 
identify ways to improve the sustainability  
of smallholder forestry practices for  
rubber plantations.
n  
 In Vietnam
, Laos and Cambodia, we 
partner with WWF to improve forestry 
practices of acacia, bamboo and rattan 
growers, and help them to share costs, 
responsibilities and insights to reach  
FSC certification. 
n  
 W
e have increased the amount of 
sustainable bamboo and acacia used  
to make IKEA products. In FY17, 100%  
of the acacia we sourced from Vietnam, 
where most of our acacia comes from,  
was FSC certified.
n  
 In Germany
, we work with FSC to better 
understand opportunities to increase forest 
certification for private forest owners.  
We also engage with other industries and 
policy-makers to promote FSC. 
n  
 In Indo
nesia, we partner with the 
Rainforest Alliance to identify criteria for 
improving small-forest-holder practices.
These initiatives promote responsible 
forestry practices, support government forest 
restoration plans and help the private sector 
meet legal requirements.

IWAY Forestry Section
What is it? 
n   The IWAY Forestry Section sets minimum 
requirements for all suppliers and underpins  
all our forestry work.
n   In FY17, there were 422 forestry-applicable3 
suppliers and 22 trained forestry and wood  
supply specialists supporting business teams  
within the forestry agenda.
n   The requirements state that wood must  
come from legally harvested, conflict-free 
forests, and not from high conservation value 
natural forests, converted tropical and  
sub-tropical forests or genetically modified 
tree plantations. 
What’s new for FY17? 
n   A new IWAY Forestry Section has been 
implemented and rolled out to IKEA home-
furnishing suppliers and is operational from 
January 2018.
n   This revision is important because it: 
simplifies the document; adds materials  
such as paper, rattan, natural fibre  
(non-industrial), bamboo, and wood-plastic 
composites; secures better compliance with 
the EU Timber Regulation (by including paper 
in the forestry scope); strengthens the due 
diligence system; sets more sustainable 
sourcing in high forestry risk countries as 
a requirement, not just a goal; and closes 
existing gaps in the routine. 
BECOMING FOREST POSITIVE: FOREST 
MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION
We work to drive FSC certification globally. In 
FY17, we used about 3% of the world’s FSC 
certified wood, and through our partnerships 
with WWF, helped to certify 18% of FSC 
certified forests around the world. We did this 
by combining improved forest management 
with conservation. Our partnership with WWF 
has helped to identify over 82,000 hectares of 
old-growth forests for protection in Romania, 
Bulgaria and Ukraine, of which around 30,000 
hectares in Romania and Ukraine received 
UNESCO World Heritage status. 
MEASURING THE IMPACT OF FSC
It can be difficult to secure and track 
sustainable forest management. That’s 
why FSC is important, particularly in the 
preservation of high conservation value forests. 
To better evaluate and communicate the impact 
of FSC, in FY14, a partnership called the 
Value and Impact Analysis initiative (VIA) was 
launched with Tetra Pak, Kingfisher, and other 
partners (see here for full list of partners). 
The initiative has shown that of the 91 million 
hectares of carbon-rich boreal forests that 
were under FSC management in 2014, over 
16 million hectares (almost 20%) have been 
set aside for protection. Boreal forests help 
to regulate the Earth’s climate by storing 
vast amounts of carbon, support indigenous 
communities, and provide habitats for large 
mammals including black bears, wolves and 
Siberian tigers. This is just one example of 
the impact that FSC can have for the world’s 
forests and biodiversity.  
AUDITING AND COMPLIANCE
We work closely with suppliers to support them 
to meet our requirements for more sustainably 
sourced wood. All suppliers must comply with 
the IWAY Forestry Section (see box), which 
contains minimum requirements for wood, 
bamboo, paper and board suppliers. 
We encourage suppliers to work towards 
FSC Chain of Custody certification (CoC) to 
ensure that the certified wood they use is not 
contaminated. Suppliers are audited based on 
the standards they use.
n  
 Suppliers who 
have achieved FSC CoC 
certification and make IKEA products 
from FSC certified wood are audited 
predominantly on an annual basis by 
independent FSC accredited certification 
organisations.
n  
 Suppliers not 
covered by FSC CoC 
certification are audited by IKEA auditors 
or independent auditors acting on behalf of 
Inter IKEA.
n  
 IKEA 
audits of suppliers in higher-risk areas 
can cover the entire supply chain back to 
the forest, including wood processing.
Relevant forestry co-workers are trained to 
understand and maintain these standards. 
Training people involved in wood purchasing 
operations is part of our obligation under the 
EU Timber Regulation.

Cotton
In FY17, we used 145,000 metric tonnes 
of cotton, around 1% of the world’s total 
supply. Cotton is a beautiful, useful material 
but conventional cotton production is water-
intensive and often relies on toxic pesticides 
and fertilisers. We want to change that –  
not just for the cotton we use, but for the 
entire industry.
We are making progress across the IKEA 
business. All cotton used for IKEA products 
is sourced from more sustainable sources4  
– improving farmers’ yields and incomes, 
reducing negative environmental impacts and 
improving livelihoods. And in 2017, for the 
second year running, the IKEA Brand ranked 
first in the Sustainable Cotton Ranking by 
Pesticide Action Network (UK), Solidaridad 
and WWF, which assesses consumer-facing 
companies that use significant amounts 
of cotton and/or play an influential role 
in sustainable cotton practices. These are 
important steps. And we want to go even 
further – setting new goals in FY18 and 
continuing to move away from conventional 
cotton production. To ensure a stable and 
sustainable supply of cotton in the future, 
and to improve the lives of farmers around 
the world, we must also go beyond our own 
value chain. That is why we we collaborate 
with partners like the Better Cotton Initiative 
(BCI), of which we are a founding member, to 
transform the wider industry (see box).
Cotton fact box
We want all of the textiles we use in our 
products to be sustainable. We are always 
making improvements and increasing the 
use of materials from more sustainable 
sources. Our strategy and approach include 
measures to reduce the use of cotton, use 
more recycled cotton and in some cases 
replace cotton with innovative new materials 
(see page 25). But we do not plan to stop 
using it entirely – it is a beautiful, versatile 
natural material and many people depend 
on it for their livelihood. That’s why we work 
to transform the cotton industry to become 
more sustainable. 
Why does cotton impact people  
and the planet? 
n   Conventional cotton production is very water-
intensive and often relies on toxic chemicals. 
n   Cotton is a monoculture – meaning that, 
with conventional cotton production 
practices, there is very limited biodiversity 
in the places where it grows.
n   Cotton production can pollute the area 
where it is grown. 
n   High costs of chemicals and irrigation  
can leave farmers close to or below the 
poverty line. 
What’s cotton from more  
sustainable sources? 
n   It includes recycled cotton, and cotton 
grown to standards such as the Better 
Cotton Initiative (BCI) and the e3 Cotton 
Program in the USA.
n   Cotton that comes from farmers who have 
implemented practices to use less water, 
fewer chemical fertilisers and pesticides, 
and are also able to increase their profits.
What does BCI do and how does the 
IKEA supply chain work with them? 
n   BCI exists to make global cotton production 
better for the people who produce it, better 
for the environment it grows in, and better 
for the sector’s future.
n   BCI’s aim is to make 30% of the world’s 
cotton production Better Cotton by 2020 by 
sharing learning and experiences with the 
wider industry. 
n   BCI connects people and organisations 
from across the cotton sector, to promote 
measurable and continuous improvements 
for the environment, farming communities 
and the economies of cotton-producing 
areas.
n   BCI hopes to increase demand for, as well 
as supply of, Better Cotton.
n   IKEA is a founding member of BCI and one 
of the world’s largest users of Better Cotton.
n   Our Cotton Leader sits on the BCI council 
and advises new members of BCI.
n   We run projects with government agencies 
and global and local agencies in our 
sourcing countries.

We work with WWF on many projects to train and 
support cotton farmers around the world. One of 
these projects is a partnership with the Gujarat 
Green Revolution Company (GGRC), an arm of the 
Gujarat state government in India, to encourage more 
sustainable methods of cotton farming that increase 
revenues for farmers. In FY17, we launched an app, 
developed with WWF and GGRC, to help farmers grow 
cotton more efficiently and sustainably (see box). 
We train suppliers and sub-suppliers on the 
requirements and working methods for sustainable 
cotton. In FY17, 46 training sessions were conducted 
with suppliers. And we completed 55 traceability audits 
in the cotton value chain, which confirmed the use of 
cotton from more sustainable sources.
In FY18, we will collaborate with more businesses, 
NGOs and local governments, using technology to 
expand our farm water-efficiency initiatives. See page 
25 for more information on our water positive ambition. 
And we’ll maintain our 100% more sustainable cotton 
commitment for the fourth year, while working across 
our supply chain to improve working conditions.  
We will work together with BCI towards the aim they 
have set to make 30% of global cotton production 
Better by 2020. And, along with BCI we aim to directly 
or indirectly impact five million farmers and have  
Better Cotton Principles embedded in nine countries. 
In FY17, the IKEA business completed a closely-
monitored project in Turkmenistan, working with a 
small number of farmers and one supplier to build 
understanding and competencies around more 
sustainable cotton practices and labour rights. While 
our assessments and audits found no breaches, the 
overall situation in the country regarding forced and 
bonded labour had not improved and we had limited 
influence beyond projects such as this. Therefore, we 
currently do not allow cotton from Turkmenistan or 
neighbouring Uzbekistan to be used in IKEA products. 
We will continue to look for opportunities to further 
influence and progress the decent work and more 
sustainable cotton agenda in different regions.
Cotton Doctor App
Developed in collaboration with WWF 
and GGRC, the COTTON DOCTOR app 
helps Gujarati farmers to maximise 
their cotton production. It sends 
weather updates and assists farmers in  
making informed decisions on cotton 
growing. It provides: 
n   forecasts on weather, pest infestation 
and disease, so that farmers can take 
proper measures to minimise losses
n   irrigation advice including updates 
on weather, soil moisture of farm 
plots and crop biomass monitoring to 
enable farmers to optimise water use
n   nutrient application advice throughout 
the growing stages of the cotton crop, 
using satellite images
n   climate alerts to advise on the best 
times to sow cotton
n   an interactive diagnosis feature for 
farmers to feed in information by 
text, photo and video, which is then 
addressed by cotton experts.

Food
Every year, 660 million people experience 
the IKEA Food offer at IKEA Restaurants, 
Bistros and Swedish Food Markets in 
49 countries. IKEA Food aims to source 
all of its food, feed and packaging from 
more sustainable sources that are good 
for the planet and everything on it. It is 
a long journey but we are committed to 
achieving this aim. This means working 
towards better standards of animal welfare 
within the supply chain, both at the farm 
level and during transport and slaughter, 
and ensuring the rights of people and 
communities throughout the supply chain. 
See page 35 for more details on how we 
work with our suppliers through IWAY. 
SOY
Soy is a nutritious plant-based food  
source for humans and animals. But its 
production can contribute to deforestation. 
The majority of soy we use is in animal 
feed. There are three main challenges  
in this area.
n  
 Segregated, certified so
y is not yet 
available in every country.
n  
 Identif
ying the amount of soy used 
throughout food supply chains is 
challenging and often relies on 
estimations. 
n  
  In 
more complex supply chains, such as 
pork, beef and dairy, where it is more 
challenging to trace the soy in animal 
feed, it can be difficult to influence the 
feed used by farmers. 
Despite this, we are making progress. 
Since FY16, all of the salmon sourced for 
the IKEA global range has used soy feed 
certified to Round Table on Responsible 
Soy (RTRS) or ProTerra standards. In 
FY17, 63% of the chicken sourced globally 
used soy feed from sources certified to 
the standards mentioned above or from 
countries with a low risk of deforestation. 
In October 2017 we joined other companies 
and NGOs in signing a letter of support for 
the Cerrado Manifesto, with the ambition 
to halt deforestation and native vegetation 
loss in the Cerrado, Brazil. And we are 
exploring other partnerships because  
we know we cannot achieve systemic 
change alone.
COCOA, COFFEE AND TEA
Since FY16, Rainforest Alliance and 
Fairtrade tea have been included in our 
definition of more sustainably sourced tea, 
in addition to UTZ.5 This enabled us to 
increase the number of stores selling tea 
from more sustainable sources to 70% in 
FY17, from 60% in FY16. With the launch 
of PÅTÅR – Swedish for “refill” – our coffee 
is now both UTZ certified and organic 
according to EU standards. The cocoa  
in IKEA branded chocolate bars is also  
UTZ certified.
FISH AND SEAFOOD
We remain committed to only sourcing 
Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) or 
Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certified  
fish and seafood, with full chain of custody 
verified to IKEA stores. By committing to 
this standard globally, we have been able 
to expand ASC and MSC labels to countries 
that previously hadn’t used them – such 
as Qatar and the UAE. One remaining 
exception is crayfish: there is currently no 
certified crayfish available in the world. 
Instead of removing crayfish from menus, 
we are working in partnership with MSC to 
encourage fisheries to adopt certification.

Animal welfare
We do not accept inhumane treatment or 
cruelty to animals. We continually review 
our approach to animal welfare and we 
are assessing new requirements and 
possibilities to secure even better practices 
and changes in FY18. 
The goal is to ensure that the animals in 
our supply chain – whether cattle, pigs, 
poultry, sheep, goats or fish – are treated 
humanely, with the opportunity to express 
natural behaviours. We have set Animal 
Welfare guidelines and are in the process 
of implementing separate programmes and 
verification processes for each species.
We collaborate with suppliers that share 
our values, and take part in constructive, 
collaborative partnerships and dialogue 
with experts, veterinarians, governments, 
academics, NGOs, and other businesses. 
BEEF, PORK, CHICKEN, EGGS  
AND DAIRY
In FY17, IKEA Food has continued to 
develop the IKEA Food Better Programmes 
to support the shift towards better animal 
welfare and a more sustainable food 
system. These programmes are a global 
baseline for animal welfare, public health, 
and our environmental footprint at the farm 
level. We are working towards separate 
programmes for each species, covering 
all the major animal species in our food 
supply chain – beef cattle, broiler chickens 
(for meat), dairy cattle, laying hens, pigs, 
and salmon. Our ambition is for these 
programmes to be fully implemented for all 
species by 2025. To live up to this ambition, 
we will develop individual roadmaps with 
specific milestones to guide our efforts 
during FY18.
 
5  The mission of 
UTZ is to create 
a world where 
sustainable farming 
is the norm, 
enabling better 
opportunities for 
farmers and their 
families, and 
helping to protect 
the planet.

Page 24:
24 |  INTER IKEA SUSTAINABILITY SUMMARY REPORT
The IKEA commitment to source free-range 
eggs is implemented by IKEA retailers, and 
in FY17, IKEA retailers reported to source 
around 80% free-range or cage-free whole, 
fresh or liquid eggs in line with our laying hen 
commitment.
DOWN AND FEATHERS
Down and feathers add comfort to some IKEA 
soft furnishing products – primarily a selected 
range of pillows and comforters. We only 
source feathers from the duck food industry. 
No down or feathers from geese are used in 
IKEA products due to the much greater risk of 
live plucking – a cruel practice that does not 
meet the IKEA standards for animal welfare. 
Since requirements for the conditions in, and 
transport to, slaughterhouses were developed 
in FY14, annual audits have been performed  
at all slaughterhouses for ducks. In FY17  
we started performing audits for farms, in 
addition to the audits for slaughterhouses  
and transport, based on requirements 
developed in FY16.
For information about our work to identify  
new materials, see page 25.
WOOL
In FY17, we continued to develop traceability 
for compliance with animal welfare standards 
for wool. We have gained better knowledge 
and understanding of the value chain which 
will enable us to implement requirements at 
every stage. We are at the start of a process 
to ensure that all of the wool we source is 
from value chains that are traceable and 
compliant with the Responsible Wool Standard, 
a voluntary global standard that addresses the 
welfare of sheep and the land they graze on. 
LEATHER
All of the leather in IKEA home furnishing 
products is sourced from just 11 tanneries. 
challenge to attain 100% segregated sources 
in the local food supply chains. For the 
remaining 1.5%, we purchase certificates that 
generate a premium for producers working to 
RSPO standards, even when the palm oil itself 
is not segregated. 
STRENGTHENING STANDARDS IN THE 
SUPPLY CHAIN
RSPO certification sets out eight social, 
environmental and economic principles to 
protect people and the planet. The IKEA palm 
oil sourcing strategy includes two additional 
criteria. Palm oil must not: 
n  
 contribute to the destruction 
of high value 
forests
n  
 come 
from plantations that have been newly 
developed on peat, since peat wetlands 
are important carbon stores with high 
biodiversity value.
All suppliers must now ensure that the palm oil 
used in IKEA products meets these additional 
criteria, or is replaced by alternative raw 
materials. Candle suppliers have produced 
roadmaps showing how they will reach this 
target. We work closely with these suppliers, 
and their sub-suppliers, to monitor their 
progress, and where necessary, support them 
to strengthen commitments. 
During on the ground assessments in FY17,  
we identified challenges around the responsible 
recruitment of migrant workers in the palm 
oil industry. We work to secure human rights 
and high standards for co-workers at our 
suppliers through IWAY, our supplier code of 
conduct (see page 35). We are pleased that 
RSPO has recognised these challenges and is 
strengthening its principles and criteria relating 
to human rights issues in palm oil supply 
chains. And we welcome RSPO’s renewed  
focus on its smallholder approach, as we 
believe that smallholders are the key to 
sustainably produced palm oil. We provided 
input to the RSPO’s updated and strengthened 
Principles & Criteria.
We are partnering with the United Nations 
Development Programme, the government 
of Indonesia and other global corporations to 
implement the Indonesian Sustainable Palm  
Oil (ISPO) Standard. The project aims to 
reduce deforestation and improve smallholder  
incomes and yields, making palm oil  
production more sustainable. We support  
the creation of the Indonesian National  
Action Plan for Palm Oil.
98.5%  
palm oil from  
RSPO certified,  
segregated  
sources
Working with fewer suppliers helps us to 
secure traceability and high standards of 
animal welfare, as well as minimise social and 
environmental risks.
Leather production involves many steps and 
has a complex supply chain. In FY17, we 
mapped 100% of the slaughterhouses in our 
leather supply chain and we are assessing 
their performance against the new IKEA Range 
& Supply slaughterhouse standard. In FY18, 
we will continue to focus on securing chain of 
custody verification routines and securing social, 
environmental and animal welfare standards. 
We aim to further improve traceability, by 
working together with the leather industry, 
food industry and other businesses.
We are part of the Textile Exchange 
Responsible Leather Initiative, an organisation 
that will work together with the food industry 
to address issues in the global leather  
supply chain.
The tanning process to soften leather uses 
chrome – a toxic chemical that can be harmful 
to the environment and workers. Since FY16, 
all the leather used to make IKEA products has 
been sourced from chrome-free processes.
Palm oil 
We use relatively small quantities of palm oil, 
around 40,000 tonnes annually. The majority 
of the palm oil we source – around 90% – is in 
our candles, around 4% is used in other home 
furnishing products and the remainder in food. 
We have minimised the use of palm oil and are 
committed to ensuring that the palm oil we do 
use is grown and processed in a responsible way. 
Palm oil is classified as being from more 
sustainable sources if it comes from 
Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) 
certified, segregated sources. In FY17, 98.5% 
of the palm oil in IKEA products came from 
more sustainable sources, and it remains a

Renewable and recycled 
materials
We aim to use more renewable and 
recycled materials in our home furnishing 
products, and move towards eliminating 
virgin fossil-based materials in our plastic 
products. We have already achieved this 
with some new IKEA products.
 n  
 ISTAD plastic bags
, relaunched in 
FY17, are the first large-scale product in 
the IKEA range made from plastic based 
on renewable material rather than fossil 
oil. At least 85% of the raw material  
now comes from leftovers from the 
sugarcane industry, and the bags can 
be easily recycled at the end of their 
life. As we sell an estimated 1.4 billion 
bags a year, this innovation will save the 
equivalent of around 75,000 barrels of 
fossil-based oil annually.

 n  
 TOMAT spray bo
ttles and SKRUTT 
desk pads are made from recycled 
plastic and paper packaging. 
In addition, 98% of the packaging used  
for IKEA products is made from renewable, 
recyclable or recycled materials.
In FY17, research was conducted to 
better understand the global availability 
of recycled materials and the possibility 
of purchasing, upgrading and using them.  
A total of 97 materials were analysed, 
resulting in the identification of high-priority 
focus materials in the areas of wood, 
plastic, paper, metals and textile, aiming  
for the fullest circular capability. 
DEVELOPMENT OF NEW MATERIALS
Sustainability, affordability, attractiveness 
and safety – all are qualities we want for 
IKEA products. And that’s what drives 
innovations in the materials used to make 
them. Research and development can 
take years, and we are always exploring 
new possibilities. There have already 
been breakthroughs with the potential 
to transform the way IKEA products are 
developed, and the materials used.
Textiles 
We aim to move away from virgin fossil-
based materials for textiles and are 
investigating new cellulose fibres to be  
used alongside more sustainably sourced 
cotton. These include hemp, flax and jute. 
And, together with partners, we have 
developed a new textile material using 
wood-based fibres. It is a sustainable 
material developed to be a good quality 
fabric at a low price. This will be introduced 
in our range over the next few years. We 
are also exploring the use of polyester 
made from bio-based materials. Together 
with our suppliers and research partners, 
we are developing new production 
techniques for bio-based polyesters in order 
to make the price and quality comparable 
to fossil-based polyester.
We use PU foam, a material made from a 
non-recyclable fossil-based feedstock, in 
comfort products like mattresses and sofas. 
We are looking into reducing the need for 
PU foam in our products, replacing it with 
solutions that are made from recycled 
and/or recyclable materials. One of these 
solutions is V-LAP (Vertically Lapped 
Polyester fibre). The V-LAP technology 
enables us to produce a comfort material 
from up to 70% recycled content that can 
be turned into new comfort products after 
customer use. And it requires 10% less 
material for the same comfort as traditional  
PU foam. The first IKEA products containing 
V-LAP – seating pads and a new dining 
chair – will be on sale in 2019.
Wood 
Many IKEA products are made with 
wood-based board and for decades new 
generations of board material have been 
developed for use in IKEA products. One 
ongoing initiative is the development of 
D-alpha board material, which uses less 
material and requires a production facility 
six times smaller than the traditional one. 
This means we can offer a well-functioning 
material at a price affordable for more of 
the many people. We have also developed 
a unique production technique to produce 
board material from recycled paper,  
called M-board. Research focusing on  
32 materials in the categories of wood, 
plastic, metal and textiles has been  
carried out into the global availability 
of recycled materials and how the IKEA 
business could purchase, upgrade, and  
use them.

products to be fit for a circular business

Supplier development
Collaborating with suppliers is key to 
transforming secondary materials and creating 
new materials. We organise our work with 
home furnishing suppliers in seven category 
areas to allow a focus on common themes, 
to share best practice and to set consistent 
standards across industries. 
Across each category area, we are making 
progress to source and create renewable 
and recycled materials, and reduce the 
environmental impact of production and 
materials. We work with seven supplier 
category areas:
n   
FLATLINE  
Products made from particleboard and 
fibreboard (MDF, HDF, hardboard).
n  
 WOOD & FIBRES 
Products 
made from hardwood (such as  
pine and spruce), layer-glued wood, 
bamboo, paper and natural fibres. 
n   
COMFORT  
Mattresses, ulphostered and filled products.
n   
TEXTILES 
Fabrics, home textiles, furniture covers, 
carpets, blinds, curtains and textile  
storage solutions. 
n   
ELECTRONICS 
Appliances, lighting and home electronic 
products.
n  
 METAL, PLASTIC & FLOAT GLASS 
Products 
made from metals, plastic and  
float glass.
n  
 SPECIFIC HOME FURNISHING
 
BUSINESS 
Small household items such as candles, 
ceramics, frames, green plants and toys.  
Supplier sustainability 
index
We use the Supplier Sustainability Index 
(SSI) to collect information from IKEA home 
furnishing and component suppliers annually. 
It helps to measure the impact of our supplier 
development and, together with our suppliers, 
identify potential improvements. SSI assesses 
whether a supplier has the right pre-conditions 
in place and whether key improvements have 
been made to reduce the overall footprint.  
It measures suppliers’ performance in four 
areas with:
n  
 Str
ategy and management systems.
n  
 Sourcing and procurement of 
energy, water, 
chemicals and materials.
n  
 Ma
nufacturing processes and resource use.
n  
 Non-utilised 
resources including waste, 
chemicals, materials and water. 
In China, an Inter IKEA collaboration with two 
students from the Environmental Defense 
Fund Fellowship supported two suppliers to 
raise their SSI scores. By identifying the root 
causes of problems and implementing a plan 
to improve, including the installation of new 
energy-efficient technology, one supplier raised 
its SSI score by 27% and the other by 18% 
in just two months. The project showed how 
the SSI provides an opportunity to encourage 
and support suppliers to improve, rather than 
placing limitations on them. 
IKEA catalogue 
The IKEA catalogue is a showcase of the 
latest product ranges. And with 203 million 
copies printed in FY17, it’s the world’s 
largest FSC certified publication.
Together with five paper suppliers and  
23 printers across 16 countries, we are 
working to reduce the climate footprint of 
the catalogue. In FY17 we cut greenhouse 
gas emissions from the catalogue by  
15% and water consumption by 19%, 
compared to FY16.

Page 27:
27 |  INTER IKEA SUSTAINABILITY SUMMARY REPORT
Water 
Across the IKEA business, we strive to 
conserve water and encourage good water 
stewardship throughout the supply chain – 
from the way operations are managed  
to sourcing raw materials and working  
with suppliers. 
The IKEA water ambitions are guided by the 
Water Working Group – a cross-functional 
team comprising leaders from across the 
IKEA business. The Water Working Group 
has developed guidelines for good water 
stewardship. Following these guidelines,  
we aim to: 
n  
 reduce 
the impact of our own and our 
suppliers’ operations
n  
 support sustainable w
ater management  
in river basins
n  
 increase access to clean 
water.
The Water Working Group has enabled the 
creation of a common global approach to  
water and has led to improved awareness 
across the business. At Inter IKEA, we have  
delivered waste water training programmes 
for co-workers and suppliers and have 
implemented waste water treatment plants 
at home furnishing suppliers, which will soon 
become a requirement under IWAY. We are 
using our learnings from the Water Working 
Group and projects undertaken by the 
Procurement team to develop a workbook  
and guidelines for all suppliers.  
In FY18, we will continue to create awareness 
of water issues across the IKEA business, and 
work with relevant stakeholders to create 
and implement mitigation plans. And an IKEA 
business partnership with WWF will help to 
develop a broader collaborative approach  
on water stewardship.
We participate in events to share insights 
and learn about ways to become better water 
stewards. In FY17, the Environmental Leader 
at IKEA Industry was invited to give a keynote 
speech at World Water Week in Stockholm. 
IKEA INDUSTRY – WORKING WITH 
WATER 
The IKEA Industry Water Manual includes 
detailed internal demands and information 
on different types of water supply, waste 
water, and examples of how to treat, re-use 
or recycle waste water before sending to the 
recipient or external treatment companies. It 
contains a Water Positive Matrix, with specific 
actions to improve water stewardship at each 
site by 2020, including raising awareness of 
regional future water risks and scarcity.
In FY17, an IKEA Industry site in Paços de 
Ferreira, Portugal, implemented a treatment 
system to reuse the waste water from glue 
production. And in Malacky, Slovakia, a  
system was implemented to enable the use of 
drainage water from perforated pipes. By using 
drainage water in production, this process 
saves 70,000m3 per year of high-quality tap 
water which can instead be used as drinking 
water by local residents.
ENCOURAGING WATER EFFICIENCY  
IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN 
We collaborate with farmers and NGOs 
throughout the IKEA supply chain to  
encourage good water management practices. 
We work with suppliers to recycle water, 
including in the ceramics category which 
is the fourth biggest consumer of water in 
the Purchasing organisation. Our ceramics 
suppliers use 3.6 million m3 water per year, 
and as ceramics processes are not very 
polluting, much of this can be easily recycled. 
Many suppliers in this category have already 
taken steps to recycle water and we hope to 
use their work as an example of best practice 
for other supplier categories. 
In FY17, we initiated a pilot with two ceramics 
suppliers from Turkey. The pilot focuses on: 
 n  
 assessing the existing cer
amics processes 
for water efficiency
n  
  identif
ying opportunities to reduce water 
usage in production processes
n  
 reuse and recy
cling of water
n  
  identif
ying water-related energy and 
chemical-saving opportunities in operations
n  
  understanding in
vestments and paybacks
n  
 learning a
bout key drivers for water 
recycling. 
We will implement the findings of the pilot 
at all of our ceramics suppliers in South East 
Asia, with the goal of achieving 100% water 
recycling for ceramics suppliers in this region. 
Suppliers benefit from reduced water-related 
costs and business risks, and we benefit 
from minimised water-related business risks 
in water-scarce regions and insights on how 
to impact our supplier categories and water 
recycling and conservation efforts. This  
will support our commitment to become a  
good water steward in the regions where  
we operate. 
Cotton is one of the most water-intensive 
materials used in IKEA products. Read 
about our work to source cotton from more 
sustainable sources on pages 21 and 22.  
It is a priority for us to provide co-workers  
with clean and safe water to drink. IKEA 
Industry has installed water dispensers at all 
sites, replacing the use of plastic bottles for  
co-worker drinking water. This will help 
especially to increase awareness and interest 
about protecting the local water cycle and will 
in addition reduce plastic waste and transport, 
lowering emissions. 
OCEAN PLASTICS 
The world’s oceans provide more than half of 
the oxygen we breathe, regulate the climate 
and support livelihoods for millions of people. 
But alarming reports state that at the current 
rate, there will be more plastic in them than 
fish by 2050.6 There is a growing movement to 
address this problem and we are determined 
to contribute not only to eliminating plastic 
waste but also to assessing what can be done 
to remove the plastic already in our oceans.  
Following a pre-study in FY17, we will launch 
a project to investigate the causes and effects 
of microplastics, the opportunities for creating 
products that avoid plastic pollution, and how 
best to support the clean-up and regeneration 
of the oceans.

The climate footprint of the IKEA value chain
The estimated total climate footprint from 
the IKEA value chain is 26 million tonnes of 
CO2e,7 corresponding to 0.1% of the world’s 
greenhouse gas emissions. We have a big 
responsibility, and opportunity, to contribute to 
limiting global warming to 2°C, aiming towards 
1.5°C, in line with the Paris Agreement. 
The footprint stretches across the lifecycle 
of IKEA products – from the sourcing of raw 
materials to manufacturing, use in customers’ 
homes and the transport in between. One of 
the main causes is the use of fossil energy 
throughout the value chain. Other contributors 
are the production of meat for IKEA Food 
products, use of fertilisers and land use 
transformation.
The aim is to significantly reduce the footprint 
from the IKEA value chain in absolute terms 
compared to FY16 – decoupling growth 
from climate footprint. This means ensuring 
responsible sourcing of materials and energy-
efficient production, and transitioning to 
electric vehicles and clean energy sources.
In FY17, the climate footprint increased  
by 4%, 26 million tonnes CO2e (from  
25 million tonnes CO2e in FY16). This  
trend needs to change, and during FY18 
absolute reduction goals will be set, with 
specific actions and directions to achieve the 
absolute reductions required to keep within the 
limits of one planet. In FY17, all models were 
updated to be actionable and a simulation tool 
was developed to forecast the likely footprint 
if we maintained ‘business as usual’, as well as 
the impact of any improvement actions. This 
has created a clear direction for how to tackle 
the contribution to climate change from the 
IKEA value chain.

Holding B.V., the largest group of IKEA 
franchisees, in the INGKA Holding B.V.

our relative improvement 
compared to set baselines

regardless of business growth. 
Being conscious of resources 
is a key IKEA value. And 
we always try to be more 
and more energy efficient. 
Being energy efficient also 
enables us to convert a 
higher percentage of energy 
to renewable sources. The 
decrease for Components 
between FY13 and FY15 is due 
mainly to a large expansion 
for one of the sites, where the 
new extension had very high 
energy efficiency standards, 
causing the figure to drop 
significantly.

Renewable energy 
A critical part of addressing climate change is 
the move to renewable energy. To make more 
renewable energy available for the many, 
we promote on-site generation of renewable 
energy across our franchise system and direct 
suppliers. Where sufficient renewable energy 
cannot be generated on-site, we aim to 
purchase it from the grid. 
In our transformation to renewable energy, 
we are focusing on both electricity and heat. 
Electricity accounts for about half the footprint. 
It is easier to convert to renewable sources 
for electricity than heat, given the current 
revolution in the solar and wind industry. 
Many of our suppliers produce for others, 
alongside Inter IKEA. We work together with 
our suppliers across their entire factories – 
not just the manufacturing for IKEA products. 
This enables us to address a footprint around 
four times bigger than that of our production. 
Together we can have a much bigger impact.
We want to lead by example. In FY17 the  
IKEA Components unit in Slovakia got 100% 
of its purchased electricity from renewable 
sources. As this unit is much larger than other 
IKEA Components sites, this has significantly 
reduced total emissions for IKEA Components 
(see table – top left).
And IKEA Industry made two significant 
investments.
n  
 A 
new energy plant to heat its site in 
Novgorod, Russia, which will be launched 
in FY18. Heat energy is generated from 
biomass instead of natural gas, reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions by 80%.
n  
 EUR 
7 million to install 18,240 solar panels 
that will cover 70,745 m2 at a production 
unit in Paços de Ferreira, Portugal. When 
complete, in early 2018, it will be one of 
the largest self-consumption installations in 
Europe, generating enough energy to power 
over 2,700 homes, and preventing 2,358 
tonnes CO2e of emissions each year.

10  Excluding paper.Raw materials
The largest footprint across the IKEA 
value chain comes from the extraction and 
processing of the raw materials used in IKEA 
products and the catalogue, corresponding to 
38% of the total footprint. Unlike for our direct 
suppliers, we can’t measure this footprint 
directly. That’s why, in FY17, we partnered  
with an external lifecycle expert, Quantis, 
to better break down this footprint and 
understand what actions to take to fulfil our 
commitment to the Paris Agreement to limit 
global warming to 2°C.
These insights will inform more specific 
directions for each of the main materials used 
to make IKEA products.
Although wood-based materials10 make up 
around 60% of the materials used to make 
IKEA products, they only represent 23% of 
the total climate footprint for raw materials. 
Plastic and metal materials, though used less, 
account for about 40%. That’s why moving 
towards recycled and renewable materials 
is key. We must also continue to focus on 
lightweight constructions and sustainably-
sourced materials. By promoting renewable 
energy from the beginning of the raw 
material production process, not just at our 
direct suppliers, we can significantly reduce 
emissions and environmental impact across  
the IKEA business.
Production
At Inter IKEA, we want to work with our 
suppliers to support them to shift to renewable 
energy – sharing knowledge and promoting 
new solutions for renewable energy and energy 
efficiency. In FY17, we hosted a knowledge-
sharing event in Bucharest. We invited 19 of 
our Southern European suppliers from across 
all of our supplier categories. External speakers 
and technology providers shared insights and 
knowledge on topics including compressed 
air, power quality, and building certifications. 
Another workshop in Warsaw, Poland, aimed  
to stimulate discussions between suppliers  
and technology providers. 
We are proud that many of our home 
furnishing suppliers have made the transition 
to renewable energy. For example, a flatline 
supplier in Lithuania generates all of its 
heat from renewable sources, and provides 
additional renewable energy from its own boiler 
to the local district heating network, enabling 
more people to access renewable energy. At 
least 48 of our suppliers generate over 90% of 
the energy they use from renewable sources, 
and at least 19 suppliers are at 99-100%. 
Around half of the suppliers at 99-100% are 
within the wooden furniture industry, with 
almost 80% located in Europe and the rest in 
China, Vietnam, India and Brazil. 
The manufacturing of IKEA products and the 
catalogue – by direct suppliers, IKEA Industry 
and IKEA Components – accounts for 12% of 
the total climate footprint. Around half of the 
footprint comes from electricity, purchased or 
generated on-site, and the rest from heat and 
fuels. That’s why the focus is on switching to 
renewable sources for both electricity  
and heat.
IKEA INDUSTRY AND IKEA 
COMPONENTS 
In FY17, IKEA Industry launched an energy 
management manual, focused on the Plan-
Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle to reduce energy 
consumption, and trained over 90 co-workers 
in how to use it. It will be implemented at all 
IKEA Industry sites during FY18 and FY19. 
Other energy-efficiency initiatives include:
n  
 internal energy
-saving and climate 
awareness workshops with factory 
management teams, resulting in reports 
outlining savings potential, and training 
programmes for technical teams
n  
 dev
elopment and installation of advanced 
“on-demand” control systems for dust 
extraction
n  
 insta
llation of control systems for 
compressors
n  
 low energy curing 
systems for surface 
lacquering processes
n  
 insta
llation of LED lighting at Inter IKEA 
Group sites.
IKEA Components sites in Slovakia and China 
converted to LED lighting and installed many 
other energy saving features. In the Slovak 
factory, a central heating, ventilation, and air 
conditioning (HVAC) system was installed, 
enabling centralised and coordinated control 
of these technologies and simplification of 
consumption measuring processes. The 
Slovakian site also installed chargers for 
electric vehicles, enabling guests and co-
workers to charge their electric cars for free.
Product use at home
The impact of IKEA products in use in customers’ 
homes accounts for 23% of the total climate footprint 
of the IKEA value chain. Broken down into product 
catagories, this consists of energy-efficient LED 
lighting (74%), appliances (23%) and the rest from 
the burning of candles. 
All IKEA products are designed to be as efficient  
as possible, and we look for innovative solutions to 
minimise the climate impact throughout the lifecycle  
of every product. 
Many of our products enable customers to live more 
sustainably at home, by saving energy, cutting  
water use, sorting and reducing waste and living  
more healthily. For example, the RYET LED bulb 
is available for EUR 0.99, making energy efficient 
lighting affordable for the many people. See Healthy  
& sustainable living, page 12.

Transport 
Product transport accounts for 4% of the 
greenhouse gas emissions generated by the 
total IKEA business. At Inter IKEA, we have 
developed a programme focusing on reducing 
the number of shipments, replacing fossil fuels 
with alternatives and rethinking, to integrate 
innovation into the transport supply chain. 
REDUCE
One way to reduce the number of shipments 
is to fit more products on every truck or ship. 
IKEA product developers look for ways to make 
products easier and more efficient to transport, 
including by flat-packing and designing them 
to be stackable. Fitting more products in the 
same space means fewer trucks on the road, 
trains on the rails and ships at sea, and a lower 
price for customers.
Ongoing collaboration between product 
developers, packaging makers, suppliers and 
distributors has enabled an increase in the 
number of goods per shipment by 4.2% since 
FY12. We are on track to achieve the target to 
reduce transport related carbon emissions by 
30% per m3 product sold by FY20.
REPLACE
Alternative fuels with low climate impact and 
alternative modes of transport are effective 
ways to minimise the climate impact of IKEA 
transport. In FY17 we developed and rolled 
out an internal programme to explain our 
standpoints on alternative fuels. 
At Inter IKEA, we aim to use advanced biofuels 
based on waste that do not compete directly 
with food crops, striving to avoid the use of 
palm oil in alternative fuels. We have also 
started testing electric goods transportation 
and recently completed a pilot project using 
electric trucks to transport goods from the 
Port of Los Angeles to a nearby warehouse. 
Additional electric transportation projects are 
being investigated for FY18. 
Although natural gas is a fossil fuel, it 
significantly reduces local air pollutants and 
noise. That’s why natural gas is an effective 
bridging fuel to establish the infrastructure for 
biogas, which has much lower greenhouse gas 
emissions.  
In FY17, IKEA Transport Asia Pacific launched 
its second biofuel pilot in partnership with a 
Chinese environmental technology company 
that manufactures and blends biofuel from 
waste cooking oil, and operates its own fuelling 
station in Shanghai. The initiative not only 
reduces transport emissions, but also removes 
used cooking oil from the food chain. In 
addition, we pioneered the use of biofuel with 
10% hydro-treated vegetable oil (HVO) in land 
transportation with another Chinese company. 
Pure HVO can cut CO2 emissions by up to 85%, 
while reducing emissions of sulphur dioxide, 
nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. 
Alternatives to road transport, such as rail, 
barge or short-distance sea shipping, could 
significantly reduce emissions of greenhouse 
gases and local air pollutants, as well as 
reducing road congestion and improving safety. 
Currently 19% of land transport shipments are 
undertaken by an alternative mode of transport 
and work is underway to increase this share.
RETHINK
Reducing and replacing are great first 
steps, but to make a big impact requires 
bold thinking. We will work to improve our 
technology to measure greenhouse gas 
emissions, and set tough targets. To be a 
leader in sustainable transport, collaboration on 
new initiatives and solutions is key, including 
working closely with transport providers. 
At Inter IKEA, we are exploring measures to 
improve network set-ups to reduce transport 
distances, including locating distribution 
centres closer to stores and using equipment 
more efficiently. 
OCEAN TRANSPORT
New ships emit significantly less greenhouse 
gas emissions and other air pollutants; 
however, because ships have a long operational 
life, it can take a while to reduce the impact of 
ocean transport. At Inter IKEA, we partner with 
industry members through the Clean Cargo 
Working Group to look for ways to reduce 
shipping emissions. 
All shipping lines will have to comply with the 
new IMO sulphur regulations from 2020, which 
will reduce toxic chemicals in oceans and the 
atmosphere. From FY18 onwards, we will start 
measuring and reporting sulphur emissions 
from our ocean transport to monitor these 
reductions. 
IKEA Supply AG (part of Inter IKEA) is a 
signatory to the Arctic Commitment, initiated 
by leading environmental NGOs to reduce the 
potentially harmful impacts of shipping in the 
fragile Arctic environment. IKEA Supply AG 
supports the phase-out of heavy fuel oil from 
Arctic shipping. No IKEA products are shipped 
via the Arctic and there are no plans to do so.

Waste 
As part of our ambition for the IKEA business 
to be a circular business, we want to move 
away from the idea of ‘waste’. Where we 
cannot reduce or eliminate waste, we see it 
as a valuable resource, providing material 
for future products. We work with the waste 
hierarchy, first prolonging the life of products 
by ensuring quality and versatility, then 
eliminating waste across our operations and 
recycling waste that is generated, or sending it 
for energy recovery. Landfill is a last resort.
RETAIL 
Waste from IKEA stores makes up more than 
77.2% of the total waste across the IKEA 
business. At Inter IKEA, we work with IKEA 
franchisees to reduce waste in stores (see the 
INGKA Holding B.V. Sustainability Summary 
Report) and offer customers the option to take 
back products for recycling or reuse – see page 
14 for further details. 
Sometimes, products or packaging can be 
damaged in transit. By working with each 
stage of a product’s journey – from product 
and packaging designers to stores – it’s 
possible to identify signs of damage early  
on and improve reporting. 
Every product is designed according to the  
five dimensions of Democratic Design, to 
ensure high quality, built-in sustainability  
and optimum lifespan (see page 12). 
FOOD
Every day, roughly 30% of the food produced 
around the world is wasted. The goal of the 
IKEA business is to cut food waste by 50% in 
IKEA food operations by the end of FY20.
In FY17, the ‘Food is Precious’ initiative was 
launched to enable IKEA co-workers to identify 
ways to prevent food waste. As part of the 
initiative, ‘smart scales’ are connected to 
kitchen bins in the IKEA food operations to 
 
11 11kg in weight 
equivalent to 4.3kg 
in carbon emissions. 
We measure this by 
combining the FAO and 
WRAP estimates (4.6 and 
3.9 respectively).

By the end of FY17, 25% of all IKEA stores 
had implemented the smart-scale solution. 
Over 200,000 kg11 of food was saved in FY17 
– saving over 865 tonnes of carbon emissions 
and nearly 450,000 meals.
We believe we can have a greater impact 
when we work together. That’s why the IKEA 
business is represented in the Champions 
12.3 coalition, hosted by the World Resources 
Institute, which brings together leaders 
from governments, businesses, international 
organisations, research institutes and civil 
society to work together to reduce food 
loss and waste, in line with Sustainable 
Development Goal 12, target 3.
MANAGING WASTE AT IKEA INDUSTRY
In FY17, IKEA Industry recycled 82% of its 
waste (excluding wooden material), sent 12% 
for energy recovery, and 6% to landfill. Over 
a third – 35% – of units sent zero waste to 
landfill. Over half – 51% – recycled over 80% 
of the waste generated.
Wood is IKEA Industry’s most used material 
(the largest material fraction). In FY17, 
1,194,910 tonnes of wooden residue were 
generated, but only 0.1% was considered 
waste. In solid wood furniture production, 
some residual wood, in the form of sawdust, 
chips and bark, is inevitable. Where suitable, 
sawdust and chips are used as raw material 
in paper mills and board industries. The rest 
is used as energy in IKEA Industry’s own 
production or for the production of biofuel,  
as wood pellets and briquettes.
IKEA Industry works with the five highest 
impact waste types for each site, setting  
goals for each material fraction, and 
establishing action plans. The IKEA Industry 
Waste Manual provides detailed instructions  
for co-workers on how to manage, handle, 
store and prevent waste.

Fair wages
In many countries, the minimum wage – the 
legal or collectively agreed amount a person 
should be paid per hour – is not enough to 
provide for people’s basic needs. These  
include healthcare, transport, clothing, 
children’s education, basic housing, a nutritious 
low-cost diet, and the ability to save. This has 
led to the need for the development of the 
“living wage” concept.
There are many factors that influence whether 
a living wage can be achieved. These include 
urban and rural differences, the wider package 
of employment benefits, links between  
working hours and wages, and the relationship 
between pay systems and productivity. We 
take a holistic approach to account for all  
of these factors.
The IKEA business has been working with the 
Fair Wage Network, drawing on their expertise 
and practical tools to guide the IKEA approach. 
There have been 52 pilot assessments in 
partnership with the Fair Wage Network to 
date, including 15 IKEA home furnishing 
suppliers in five countries and seven IKEA 
Industry Group units in three countries.
At Inter IKEA, we will use the learnings to 
create an integrated approach across the 
IKEA value chain, aiming for fair, decent and 
competitive employment practices, supported 
by good working conditions and strong 
compliance. 
Respect for human rights is central to the way 
the IKEA business works. Together with our 
partners, we want to empower people to create 
a better everyday life for themselves, whatever 
their circumstances. We set standards for our 
own operations, IKEA suppliers and business 
partners – together creating a positive impact 
for people across our value chain.
The IKEA business has a people-centred 
culture, where togetherness and respect for 
others are shared responsibilities and ways of 
working. Inter IKEA places a strong emphasis 
on communicating the importance of human 
rights to co-workers and suppliers. Respecting 
human rights requires as a minimum:
n  
 setting clear expectations 
for ourselves  
and our suppliers
n  
 monitoring 
implementation and impact 
across our business  
n  
 influencing change or 
taking action to 
remedy where needed
We constantly work to strengthen our due 
diligence processes and identify emerging 
issues and risks,
 
to prevent negative impacts 
and
 
to find opportunities to
 
have
 
a positive 
impact on people’s lives.

10  IWAY Musts 
are the immediate 
requirements that 
IKEA suppliers 
must meet before 
a contract can be 
signed – critical 
home-furnishing 
sub-suppliers are 
audited against 
these requirements.
Millions of people work in the IKEA supply 
chain, including approximately 600,000 people 
at tier 1 home furnishing suppliers alone.
We have a responsibility to secure good social, 
environmental and working conditions for the 
many people in the IKEA supply chain. We 
work to build strong foundations of mutual 
respect and transparency with our suppliers. 
The IKEA supplier code of conduct – IWAY – 
has been at the heart of our approach for  
18 years. It sets out our minimum 
requirements on environmental, social and 
working conditions. It is a starting point for 
developing shared values and expectations 
with our suppliers.
Since its inception in 2000, IWAY has been 
regularly updated to address emerging social 
and environmental risks. IWAY requirements 
apply to IKEA suppliers. They include a set 
of requirements applicable to every supplier. 
There are additional requirements for certain 
parts of the supply chain – for example 
forestry (see page 20) and transport (see page 
36) – or to clarify the IKEA position on specific 
issues such as the prevention of child labour 
and support for young workers (see page 39). 
IWAY AUDITS
Communicating requirements and tracking 
progress through regular audits helps us to 
maintain consistent standards. Training and 
support is provided to resolve ongoing or 
emerging challenges, and we work with 
suppliers to help them make a clear link 
between better working conditions and 
business success.
Where suppliers in scope were not IWAY 
approved in FY17, or not in the process of 
being phased out, implementation plans are in 
place and on track to achieve IWAY approval - 
read more on page 51.
We also support a number of home furnishing 
suppliers to train and audit their own suppliers 
(IKEA sub-suppliers). For some issues, such as 
child labour, we may undertake targeted audits 
with sub-suppliers to better understand the 
nature of the risk and the current situation in 
the lower tiers of the supply chain.

BEYOND AUDITS
We monitor and seek improvement in 
suppliers’ compliance rate – a measure of 
continuous performance over time. The IWAY 
Training Programme supports these efforts, 
as well as building IWAY competence and 
knowledge within relevant IKEA organisations. 
The programme is a key pillar in the IWAY 
system, ensuring all co-workers involved 
in the IWAY process have the skills and 
understanding to communicate and implement 
IWAY with suppliers. A team of six global and 
34 regional trainers work together to deliver 
the different modules of the IWAY Training 
Programme to all relevant co-workers.
BUILDING STRONG RELATIONSHIPS
Our average supplier relationship is 11 years 
for home furnishing suppliers, with some 
lasting for more than 40 years. Developing 
good long-term relationships with our  
suppliers is the key to maintaining efficiency, 
stability and innovation within the IKEA  
supply chain. We work to develop mutual  
trust and open dialogue with suppliers, 
supporting them to achieve positive and 
sustainable changes to their environmental  
and social performance.
HEALTH AND SAFETY IN THE SUPPLY 
CHAIN
IKEA sustainability compliance auditors 
work closely with suppliers to support the 
development of a strong health and safety 
culture that aligns with the expectations  
we set for Inter IKEA operations. IWAY 
includes requirements for worker health  
and safety, emergencies and fire prevention, 
and chemicals.
Improving conditions in the transport supply chain
The transport industry, particularly in the EU, has 
gone through structural changes over the last 10 
years. Competition has increased, sub-contracting 
and complex cross-border chains are common, and 
legislation is not always clear.
 
Transport workers can 
risk exploitation, for example with respect to wage 
practices and working conditions.
Inter IKEA recognises the challenges of the transport 
industry and, despite not directly employing drivers, 
we have a responsibility to positively influence working 
conditions in our own supply chain while working with 
others to advocate for wider change. The Inter IKEA 
Global Transport function leads these efforts.
IWAY requirements put clear and strict demands on 
transport service providers with respect to salaries, 
working conditions and following applicable legislation. 
Regular audits and measures such as unannounced 
driver interviews help to identify issues. Wherever 
non-compliance is found, the Transport function works 
with the relevant supplier to resolve the issues or, if 
necessary, terminate the contract. 
In 
FY17, the Inter IKEA Global Transport function 
met with stakeholders from other companies, the 
transportation industry, government, transport unions 
and non-governmental organisations to seek their 
views and perspectives on social conditions in the EU 
transportation industry. 
A new Sub-Contracting Chain Management (SCCM) 
programme has been developed to embed good 
practice deeper in the supply chain. Based on existing 
IWAY standards and compliance with EU transport 
legislation, the SCCM programme introduces minimum 
standards for transport sub-suppliers engaged in 
outsourced transportation. In FY17, the programme 
was piloted with a number of European transport 
service providers that outsource large proportions of 
IKEA international transport within the EU, before being 
rolled out to other IKEA service providers in Europe. 
The programme has been adapted for regions outside 
Europe and will be implemented worldwide in FY18.
To effect wider change in the transport industry, the 
Inter IKEA Global Transport function is:
n   seeking dialogue with various stakeholders in the 
transport industry such as law makers, experts, 
transport service providers, contractors and unions
n   calling for clearer regulations at EU level and for  
clear authority accountability regarding 
implementation and monitoring for compliance.

Supporting  
migrant workers in  
the supply chain
Smallholders 
and home-based 
workers
More people around the world are seeking working 
opportunities abroad – out of choice or necessity. 
When undertaken responsibly, the recruitment of 
migrant workers can benefit everyone involved. If 
not, it can have negative impacts. For example:
n  
 W
orkers may be required to pay high 
recruitment fees or have their passports 
withheld, leading to the risk or forced or  
bonded labour.
n  
 Emplo
yers may experience high turnover rates 
or skill mismatches.
In FY17, Inter IKEA undertook a second project 
with the International Organization for Migration 
(IOM) to map labour supply chains leading to 
IKEA suppliers in South East Asia. This included 
assessments at the suppliers and at recruitment 
agencies in both the countries of origin of migrant 
workers and countries of destination.
It provided a clearer picture of migrant workers’ 
journeys from their homes to IKEA suppliers 
in selected corridors, and highlighted the risks 
associated with cross-border recruitment. In many 
countries, legislation and established practice are 
based on workers paying recruitment fees and 
other costs. Workers can accumulate high levels of 
debt before they even start working in the country 
of destination. 
Based on learnings from this project, the IKEA 
Guidelines on Responsible Recruitment have been 
developed. They aim to build the understanding 
and ability of suppliers to responsibly manage the 
recruitment of migrant workers. The focus is on 
cross-border migration through recruitment 
agencies or intermediaries, but the general 
principles apply to all types of recruitment.
To extend the impact beyond our own suppliers, 
we are one of the founding members of the 
Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment 
which was convened by the Institute for Human 
Rights and Business. It is a group of like-minded 
companies and organisations set up with the aim 
of eradicating worker-paid recruitment fees over 
the coming decade, based on the “Employer Pays” 
principle. We have committed to advocate for this 
goal more widely, with governments, businesses 
and other relevant organisations.
Small-scale farmers or people who work at  
home – for example in the natural fibre, forestry, 
textiles and food supply chains – are part of the 
informal employment sector. While this type of 
work enables flexibility, it also leaves workers at  
an increased risk of poor working conditions and 
low incomes.
The IKEA business has a long history of working 
with smallholders and farmers in different sectors 
to ensure decent working conditions – for example, 
as part of our efforts to source wood and natural 
fibres (read more on pages 18 and 19) and cotton 
from more sustainable sources (read more on 
pages 21 and 22).
Our handmade carpet industry in India has 
undergone transformational change since 2010, 
moving from home-based production to an 
industry set-up involving six suppliers and 4,000 
workers across 20 weaving centres. Weavers are 
provided with regular work in a safe environment, 
with legal, regulated wages, alongside benefits 
such as holidays and transport. Trainees are 
paid while they learn at our specialised weaving 
schools, and our new loom requires less physical 
strength to operate, enabling more women to 
enter the profession.
We are expanding our work with smallholders to 
other parts of our supply chain, such as food  
(read more on pages 23 and 24).

Social entrepreneurs
FY17 marks the fifth year of the IKEA 
business working with social entrepreneurs 
around the world. Partnerships are formed 
with enterprises that employ women and 
other groups who may otherwise find 
it difficult to access the labour market. 
These are businesses with a broader 
social purpose, that want to address this 
challenge by building a business and 
enhancing livelihoods. 
The relationship is based on trade not aid. 
It gives the IKEA business access to unique 
skills or services, creating limited edition 
collections available to IKEA customers at 
affordable prices. And it enables the people 
involved to become self-reliant, and to  
build a better life for themselves and  
their families.
International partners supply co-created 
limited edition products in the craft and 
food value chains, centrally sourced 
and available in several countries. Local 
partners supply services such as sewing, 
and limited edition collections of upcycled 
IKEA textile waste in IKEA stores and 
distribution centres, sourced and supplied 
within specific IKEA countries or stores.
Local partners are audited for IWAY  
Must requirements and international 
partners are audited for all IWAY 
requirements. The four existing 
international partners are IWAY approved. 
The two new partners in Jordan and 
Uganda fulfil IWAY Must requirements and 
are planning for IWAY approval. 
In FY17, Inter IKEA undertook third-
party social impact assessments with two 
international partners in India: Industree 
Producer Transform and Rangsutra. The 
audits found that women working at these 
organisations are experiencing economic 
empowerment. Income generation and 
skills training have enabled the women 
to invest in their children’s education, 
purchase essential clothes and food,  
save for the future, and develop increased 
confidence and pride.
At Inter IKEA we are in the early stages 
of developing an initiative with a new 
philanthropic approach, with the aim of 
further supporting and accelerating the 
movement of social entrepreneurship.

Upholding children’s rights 
and supporting opportunities 
for young people
THE IMPORTANCE OF CHILDREN’S 
RIGHTS
Every action associated with the IKEA business 
– in the workplace, on the market, and in 
local communities – has a direct or indirect 
impact on children. It is vital that this impact 
is positive. Children are the most important 
people in the world, and every IKEA company 
has a responsibility to support and enhance 
their rights.
INTEGRATING CHILDREN’S RIGHTS
The Children’s Rights and Business Principles 
(the Principles) provide a comprehensive 
framework for understanding and addressing 
business impacts on children’s rights and 
wellbeing. They were launched in 2012 by 
Save the Children, the UN Global Compact 
and UNICEF, and at Inter IKEA we use them 
to structure our entire approach to children’s 
rights, including examining the impact of  
the business.
Read more about our efforts to support 
children’s right to play on page 13.
PREVENTING CHILD LABOUR AND 
SUPPORTING YOUNG WORKERS
Children have the right to be children. They 
should never be engaged in work that deprives 
them of this, particularly where it is potentially 
dangerous or interferes with their education 
and development. We take any suspected 
cases of child labour within the IKEA supply 
chain very seriously. We investigate and follow 
up on each case using a consistent process, 
always focusing on the best interest and safety 
of the child, and taking account of specific 
circumstances such as whether the child has 
access to education. 
In FY17, there was one suspected case of child 
labour. After a full investigation, we were able 
to confirm that this was not a case of child 
labour.
The IKEA Way on Preventing Child Labour 
and Supporting Young Workers guides this 
approach. It also clarifies our position on 
enabling young people who are legally 
able to work to access decent employment 
opportunities. 
It is important that young workers under the 
age of 18 who are legally allowed to work can 
access appropriate jobs that provide them 
with safe, secure opportunities to develop. 
The IKEA Way on Preventing Child Labour 
and Supporting Young Workers is used by all 
organisations implementing IWAY. It aims to 
ensure suppliers feel confident to offer suitable 
work to people under 18, where it is safe and 
legal to do so.
We provide training and work experience for 
young workers at IKEA units, where safe and 
appropriate (see right).

Partnering with 
communities for  
positive change
Different IKEA units work with local 
communities to create a positive impact  
on livelihoods and contribute to an inclusive 
local economy.
The IKEA Industry Community Involvement 
Manual sets out a standardised approach to 
community engagement for IKEA Industry 
units. This includes identifying the highest 
priority local issues, partnering with relevant 
organisations and working together for lasting, 
meaningful change.
For example, in FY17 IKEA Industry Lubawa, 
Poland, organised an electro-waste collection 
campaign for the local community. People were 
given plants in exchange for their electrical 
waste, which totalled over 4.1 tonnes. The 
team at IKEA Industry Lubawa also visits 
several nearby schools and kindergartens 
every year, educating and informing children 
about sustainable development.
Many IKEA Purchasing and Logistics offices 
around the world participate in projects to 
enhance their local communities. In FY17, 
projects included a partnership to make life 
better for children with cancer in Turkey, 
provision of after school clubs for children 
in China, and improvements to school 
infrastructure in India to enhance the learning 
environment and reduce drop-out rates.
In China many people leave their home 
towns, seeking work in urban areas to support 
their families. This can lead to children being 
separated from their parents, sometimes 
for years at a time. We are partnering with 
suppliers to reunite the workers with their 
families. The I Care initiative includes:
n  
 I Ho
mes – family dormitories, after school 
centres near supplier sites, and local school 
enrolment for migrant children
n  
 I Cent
ers – centres that help migrant 
children integrate with the local community.
In FY17, five additional suppliers joined the 
I Home project, bringing the total to seven. 
There are currently four I Centers, with plans 
for four more in FY18. More than 500 children 
have benefited directly and indirectly from 
I
 
Home, and 120 families have benefited from 
I
 
Centers so far. Learnings from I Care have 
been shared with other companies in China 
– one is already planning to set up family 
dormitories in its own factories; another is 
planning an after school centre.

Co-worker health, safety and  
wellbeing at IKEA Industry
A healthy, safe working environment is a 
fundamental right. It is also
 a 
prerequisite 
for high quality, stable production. Ensuring 
safety at work requires people to take 
shared responsibility for everyday actions 
and behaviours. IKEA Industry enhances 
the guidance provided in safety and security 
manuals through regular targeted training, and 
reviews health, safety and security compliance 
annually at each IKEA Industry unit. 
Regular Environment, Health and Safety 
Grading (EHSG) assessments check 
compliance with relevant IWAY requirements 
at IKEA Industry units – read more about 
IWAY on page 35. Visits between auditors 
from different IKEA Industry locations enables 
shared learning and benchmarking. In FY17, 
IKEA Industry carried out follow-up work with 
40 units to resolve any issues identified during 
EHSG visits.
In FY17, 120 health and safety specialists 
and safety champions were trained to support 
the implementation of STAY SAFE – a tool 
designed to encourage safe working habits. 
IKEA Industry will implement a ‘train the 
trainer’ programme in FY18 to involve all line 
managers and leaders in the development of  
a strong safety culture.
In FY17, IKEA Industry completed the 
collection and analysis of data for the IKEA 
Industry Chemical Management Database. This 
included evaluating more than 4,200 Chemical 
Safety Datasheets from suppliers against the 
strictest national legislation in all 10 countries 
of operation. The database will be used to 
undertake comprehensive risk assessments 
and reduce, then phase out, the use of 
hazardous substances – reducing the  
exposure of co-workers and suppliers to 
chemicals of concern.
Wellbeing extends beyond the working day.  
It includes the ability to enjoy a decent 
standard of living outside work – read  
more on page 34.
In FY17, incident reporting increased as a 
result of our continued focus on developing a 
strong culture of recognition and reporting. 
Co-workers are more willing to report incidents 
and, with increased reporting, we can better 
investigate and understand the root causes to 
avoid more serious accidents from occurring. 
The number of lost time accidents – those 
requiring one or more days of absenteeism 
– and the lost time accident rate increased. 
There is no single reason for this, and IKEA 
Industry will continue working to minimise 
risks in production, improve ergonomics and 
communicate with co-workers to ensure that 
the importance of safety is understood by all. 
There were no on-site co-worker fatalities  
in FY17.

IKEA 
co-workers  
People do their best work when they feel valued 
and are able to be themselves. Each of the 
194,000 co-workers across the IKEA business is 
unique and brings new perspectives and ideas. 
Updated IKEA values
Our shared values and strong culture make  
IKEA unique, both as a place to work and as  
a brand. In each and every IKEA unit around  
the world, there are co-workers who share the  
same IKEA values. 
The first version of the IKEA values was 
drafted together with the founder of IKEA, 
Ingvar Kamprad, in the early 90s. In FY17, we 
modernised and simplified that version and 
included an additional value about sustainability. 
A common recruitment 
approach for the IKEA 
franchise system
Our uniqueness is built by people. And it starts 
with the people we recruit. In FY17, we worked 
together with franchisees to create a common 
recruitment approach for the IKEA franchise 
system. The approach describes key principles 
for recruitment, to guide different markets in 
developing their local recruitment processes  
or plans.
Across the IKEA business we aim to recruit 
down-to-earth, straightforward and curious 
people who want to develop the IKEA business, 
society and themselves. These are people  
who share the IKEA values and can enrich  
our culture; people who want to contribute  
to creating a better everyday life for the  
many people.
Going forward, Inter IKEA will develop additional 
approaches for leadership and learning, as  
well as a common people strategy for the  
IKEA franchise system. 
Equality, inclusion and diversity
The IKEA business is present in many different 
countries, with IKEA stores in 49 markets and 
suppliers in 51 countries. Equality, inclusion and 
diversity increase our understanding of IKEA 
customers and each other. That is why IKEA 
companies recruit for and embrace diversity – to 
create a workforce including people of all ages, 
backgrounds, mindsets and perspectives. And 
we want an environment of openness where 
everyone is important, and feels comfortable  
to experiment and try new ways. 
In FY17 (see table below), 41% of Inter IKEA 
co-workers were women, and 35% of Inter IKEA 
managers were women. Overall, the figures 
are improving, but we still have a way to go to 
achieve diversity and equality. The Inter IKEA 
Group Management Board and the Supervisory 
Board had no female members in FY17.
We actively pursue all aspects of diversity, 
equality and inclusion across the whole of Inter 
IKEA. For example, to increase the number of 
women in leadership positions, IKEA Industry 
has a Female Potential programme, which aims 
to support and prepare female candidates to 
take management positions.
IKEA learning offer
Inter IKEA supports learning in the everyday 
business by offering unique opportunities linked 
to the needs of the IKEA business and IKEA 
customers. In FY17, we further developed 
the IKEA learning offer together with IKEA 
franchisees to better address these needs. This 
included investing in our common learning 
management system – My Learning – to make 
it more functional, effective and easy to use. 
All 194,000 IKEA co-workers can access a 
combination of face-to-face and digital content 
through My Learning. The system currently 
offers 750 learning solutions.
With the IKEA approach to learning and the 
IKEA learning offer we want to empower IKEA 
people to learn, develop and perform in any 
given situation. The IKEA culture encourages an 
environment of trust, where co-workers can dare 
to explore, experiment, learn and continuously 
develop – prerequisites for a high performing 
learning organisation.

Governance and ethics
Sustainability governance 
and management
SUSTAINABILITY ACROSS THE  
IKEA VALUE CHAIN
The IKEA business is operated through a 
franchise system. Inter IKEA Systems B.V.  
is the owner of the IKEA Concept and 
worldwide IKEA franchisor. We are committed 
to working together across and beyond the 
IKEA franchise system in a collaborative way, 
being transparent about what we learn and 
making continuous improvements. 
All franchisees are obliged to comply with the 
IKEA Requirements, which includes IConduct. 
These include specifications for working with 
the IKEA Brand and Concept, and general 
business requirements. These business 
requirements are comparable with the IKEA 
code of conduct for suppliers, IWAY. During 
2018, we will introduce new ambitions and 
commitments for the entire IKEA franchise 
system and value chain leading up to 2030. 
The IKEA sustainability strategy will secure a 
common sustainability agenda for the IKEA 
franchise system and value chain.  
IKEA Sustainability Council 
The Strategic Sustainability Council is a 
governance body that includes representatives 
from Inter IKEA Group entities, as well as 
franchisees. This Council ensures that we share 
the same positions across the IKEA franchise 
system and align on future developments and 
cross-company goals and commitments, while 
respecting the different assignments and the 
independence of the companies in the IKEA 
franchise system.
The Strategic Sustainability Council was 
established in February 2017 to take 
responsibility for sustainability decisions 
affecting the IKEA value chain, including:
n  
 The IKEA B
rand’s role in society 
n  
 Sustainabilit
y strategies and goals across 
the franchise system 
n  
 Compliance with and 
requirements for 
sustainability goals through IWAY, the IKEA 
supplier code of conduct.1
The Strategic Sustainability Council meets 
at least twice a year and consists of eight 
representatives from Inter IKEA Group, two 
from INGKA Holding B.V. – the largest group 
of IKEA franchisees – and representatives from 
the franchisees Al-Sulaiman and IKANO. The 
Managing Directors of each of the companies 
are members of the Council.
Sustainability-related working groups 
Experts on specific topics from Inter IKEA and 
franchisees meet in working groups to share 
best practice and build knowledge through the 
IKEA value chain. They discuss and align on 
strategic initiatives and plans to fulfil the IKEA 
sustainability strategy. There are currently 
working groups on energy, water and waste. 
SUSTAINABILITY AT  
INTER IKEA GROUP
The Inter IKEA Sustainability Management 
Group includes the sustainability managers 
from various Inter IKEA Group entities. It  
is responsible for developing and updating  
the IKEA sustainability strategy and for 
providing recommendations on strategic 
business decisions with environmental and 
social impacts. It is also responsible for 
preparing for the meetings of the Strategic 
Sustainability Council.
The members of the Inter IKEA  
Sustainability Management Group are:  
Policy & Compliance Manager, Inter IKEA 
Group; Sustainability Manager, Inter  
IKEA Systems B.V.; Sustainability Manager,  
IKEA Industry; Sustainability & Health 
Manager, IKEA Food; Sustainability Manager, 
Transport; Sustainability Manager, IKEA Range

Business ethics
At Inter IKEA, we set high standards for all of 
our co-workers in the Inter IKEA Group Code 
of Conduct, and the Inter IKEA Group Policy 
and Standard on Anti-Corruption. Overall, it is 
all about doing good business with common 
sense, based on honesty, respect, fairness  
and integrity.
We investigate policy breaches and ensure 
a consistent and accountable approach to 
internal investigations through the Inter IKEA 
Group Rule of Investigation, updated in FY17. 
In FY17 we started to train selected co-workers 
in applying the Rule of Investigation. We are 
working to extend the rule to cover different 
kinds of investigations, including HR issues 
such as mobbing and harassment.
TRAINING
We train all co-workers on the Inter IKEA 
Group Code of Conduct, which includes Anti-
Corruption. The IKEA purchasing organisation 
within IKEA Range & Supply is more exposed 
to corruption risks and receives more in-depth 
training on business ethics.
RAISING CONCERNS
We promote an open and honest culture, 
encouraging co-workers to raise concerns 
about misconduct with individuals and their 
managers where possible. When co-workers 
feel uncomfortable addressing an issue 
personally, they can do so through the Inter 
IKEA Group Raising Concern Line. In FY17,  
42 concerns were reported.

Performance against  
People & Planet Positive 
targets FY17-FY20
The table below summarises the performance of 
IKEA Range & Supply and IKEA Industry against 
the commitments and targets made before the 
transfer of range, supply and production activities 
to Inter IKEA Group from INGKA Holding B.V.. The 
targets in the table are part of the People & Planet 
Positive sustainability strategy for 2020, launched 
by INGKA Holding B.V. in 2012 and have remained 
applicable in the new Inter IKEA Group structure. 
An updated IKEA sustainability strategy with new 
ambitions and commitments for the franchise 
system and value chain leading up to 2030 will 
be introduced by Inter IKEA Systems B.V. during 
FY18. All targets below will be revised and updated 
based on the new IKEA sustainability strategy. 
Progress against expired People & Planet Positive 
targets and indicators can be found in previous 
Sustainability Reports of INGKA Holding B.V..
TARGETS/INDICATORS PERFORMANCE FY17
Enabling Change 
Enabling change throughout our business to become people and planet postive
Progress towards FY17 targets/indicators
1 By August 2017, 95% of IKEA co-workers state that “sustainability is a natural part of the  
everyday work”. 
We continue our efforts to make sustainability an integrated part of everyday work, through integrating it to co-worker learning and 
development.
Proportion of co-workers who see sustainability as a natural part of their daily work (according to co-worker survey “VOICE” FY17): 
 - IKEA R
ange & Supply: 83%  
 - IKEA Indu
stry: 84% 
 - Inter IKEA
 Systems B.V. and Inter IKEA Group: Not available
This goal was set while IKEA Range & Supply and IKEA Industry belonged to INGKA Holding B.V.. There is no aggregated data on this 
target available for Inter IKEA Group co-workers.  
The word ”natural part” has been shown to be unclear and open to interpretation by our co-workers, we will rephrase the question 
moving forward.
2 By August 2017, at least 95% of IKEA co-workers view IKEA as a company that takes  
social and environmental responsibility. 
We continue our work to integrate sustainability in the daily work of co-workers across the IKEA business.
Proportion of Inter IKEA co-workers who feel responsible for minimising the negative impact on the environment in their daily jobs: 
 - IKEA R
ange & Supply: 88% 
 - IKEA Indu

 - Inter IKEA
 Systems B.V. and Inter IKEA Group: Not available
And who feel proud of the way the IKEA business works with sustainability: 
 - IKEA R
ange & Supply: 90%

 - Inter IKEA
 Systems B.V. and Inter IKEA Group: Not available
3 By August 2017, at least 95% of our suppliers view the IKEA business as a business that  
takes social and environmental responsibility.
91% of Inter IKEA suppliers strongly or mostly agree that the IKEA business demonstrates social and environmental responsibility 
through its actions (according to supplier survey FY16). We work closely with our suppliers to share our approach and support them in 
improving their impact for people and the planet. See page 36.
Progress towards FY18-FY20 targets/indicators
4 By August 2020, the IKEA Brand is seen as number one home furnishing retailer for operating in a 
way that is better for people and the environment on each market and we see, on a country basis, 
a minimum 3% increase in awareness annually on two strategic areas related to People & Planet 
Positive topics. 
The perception that the IKEA Brand operates in a way that is better for society and the environment continued to increase for the  
third year running, especially among 15-24 year olds.
The IKEA Brand1 is: 
 - seen as a
n enabler for people to reduce energy consumption (+4% vs FY14) 
 - a compan
y committed to using renewable energy (+3% vs FY14)

TARGETS/INDICATORS PERFORMANCE FY17
A more sustainable life at home 
Take the lead in developing and promoting products and solutions that enable customers to live a more sustainable life at home
Progress towards FY17 targets/indicators
5 By September 2017, offer the most energy efficient home appliances at the lowest price. Out of the 105 appliances in the IKEA range, 70 have energy ratings. We aim to offer affordable energy efficient home appliances; 
however, the majority of the highest-rated energy efficient home appliances were still in the high price range.
Progress towards FY18-FY20 targets/indicators
6 By August 2020, achieve more than a fourfold increase in sales from products and solutions 
inspiring and enabling customers to live a more sustainable life at home.
The IKEA range enables people to actively live a healthier and more sustainable life at home with a focus on the efficiency and 
functions of the home. There are over 500 affordable products and solutions that enable customers to improve water and energy 
efficiency, generate renewable energy, and sort waste. See page 12.
We have found that this target does not give an accurate reflection of the impact of our products in enabling customers to live a  
more sustainable and healthy life, and will explore alternatives. In addition, this target applies to INGKA Holding B.V. sales.
This target was modified during FY17 to secure a focus on providing solutions with healthy and sustainable living functions, rather than 
increasing sales volumes. 
7 Take a lead in more sustainable food by enabling and encouraging a balanced diet. We have made progress against this target, and continue to expand the range of healthy and sustainable food options for IKEA 
customers. In FY17,
 
we launched MUNSBIT fruit and nut snacks as well as dairy free smoothies. We offer vegetarian options such as 
veggie balls and have introduced a new soda range in the drink towers in IKEA Restaurants and IKEA Bistros that contain 50% less 
sugar than the drinks they replaced. See page 13.
Resource independence 
Strive for resource independence by using resources within the limits of the planet and by encouraging all waste to be turned into resources
Progress towards FY17 targets/indicators
8 By August 2017, the majority of the renewable materials used (wood, cotton, cocoa, tea, coffee) 
will come from more sustainable sources. 
Achieved in FY17: 
 - 77% of w
ood and 100% of cotton sourced for IKEA products were from more sustainable sources. 
 - 70% of IK
EA retail markets are serving tea from more sustainable sources. 
 - PÅTÅR, th
e new IKEA coffee range launched in FY17, is both UTZ certified and organic (EU standard). 
 - The cocoa
 in IKEA branded chocolate bars is UTZ certified.
See pages 18-24.
9 By August 2017, 100% of our wood from priority areas (countries where IKEA, along with our 
partners, have identified high risk of sustainability challenges and forestry) will be from more 
sustainable sources.
Achieved. See pages 18-20.
10 By August 2017, 50% of the non-renewable materials used in our  
home furnishing products will come from recycled sources.
Proportion of materials from recycled sources: 
Carbon steel 
 50%                    Aluminium 
 72%
 
Plastic  
 22%                    F

            3% 
Stainless steel 
 50%                    T
otal, weighted  
 32%
W
e knew that this ambition would be challenging due to the lack of existing infrastructures. The main challenge is in plastics where 
there are not sufficient volumes of recycled materials. We continue to strive towards our ambition to use more recycled materials as 
part of our transformation to a circular business.
See page 26.

49 |  INTER IKEA SUSTAINABILITY SUMMARY REPORT
TARGETS/INDICATORS PERFORMANCE FY17
11 By August 2017, all of the leather we use will have full chain of  
custody and be produced according to standards that help protect  
forests and respect human rights and animal welfare.
This target was modified, as the leather supply chain has changed. It was possible to trace leather to the slaughterhouse by  
August 2017. For more information see INGKA Holding B.V. Sustainability Summary Report FY17.
In FY17, we collected information on all of the slaughterhouses in our leather supply chain, assessing their performance  
against the new IKEA Range & Supply slaughterhouse standard. See page 24.
Progress towards FY18-FY20 targets/indicators
12 By August 2020, we aim to source 100% of our wood, paper and cardboard products from more 
sustainable sources. These sources are defined as FSC certified or recycled wood. 
 
 
 - 
 Before A
ugust 2020, become forest positive. Continue to maintain full compliance with our 
forestry requirements. Promote the adoption of sustainable forestry methods beyond our  
needs and across the industry and contribute to ending deforestation.
We have made progress against this target. 
 - 77% of w
ood, paper and cardboard came from more sustainable sources, up from 61% in FY16. 
 - 100% of 
wood in high-risk countries came from more sustainable sources. 
 - Extended
 scope of IWAY Forestry Section by adding new materials (paper, composites, natural fibers) to follow forestry requirements.
See pages 18-20.
On track. We continue to work with partners, policymakers and smallholders to promote sustainable forestry practices, scale up  
FSC certification and further engage small forest holders in our supply chain, and prevent deforestation. See pages 18-20.
13 By August 2020, contributing to FSC certification of an additional 15 million hectares of forest  
in priority areas – which is equivalent to more than double the total area needed to supply  
IKEA production. Baseline year is FY13. 
On track, despite some challenges to meet the last hectares. The biggest challenge is engaging small private forest owners in  
FSC certification. We are working to overcome this by working with FSC and through our partnerships with WWF (in 14 countries)  
and Rainforest Alliance, focusing on improving forestry practices among smallholders. See pages 18-20.
14 By August 2020, become water positive by promoting water stewardship throughout our value 
chain. Contributing, with others, to improved water management in water stressed areas where  
we operate, focusing on both water use and water quality and helping people to have access to 
clean water.
By August 2020, all plastic material used in our home furnishing products will be 100% renewable 
and/or recycled. The scope is plastics category products which we sell, textile products, packaging 
and components for furniture.
Continued progress towards this target by leading and developing water stewardship programmes. See page 25. 
We have made some progress but are not on track.
Of the plastic material used in our home furnishing products, 31% is renewable and/or recycled. In FY17, we launched the  
ISTAD bags made from plastic based on renewable materials and KUNGSBACKA kitchen fronts made from recycled PET bottles.  
See page 26.
15 Develop and start implementing higher welfare standards for pigs  
by August 2016 and for beef cattle by August 2017. 
Our ambition is to source food with good standards of animal welfare. The IKEA Food Better Programmes are global, developed with 
input from experts, NGOs and suppliers and set our minimum requirements for sourcing. We have separate programmes for each 
species, covering all the major animal species in our food supply chain – broiler chickens (for meat), laying hens, dairy cattle, beef 
cattle, pigs and salmon. Our ambition is for these programmes to be fully implemented for all species by 2025. We will develop 
individual roadmaps with specific milestones to guide our efforts during FY18.
The target was modified during the development of the standards for better animal welfare and more sustainable agriculture, taking 
further input from stakeholders into account. See page 23.
16 By August 2020, 90% of our home furnishing products will be more sustainable with documented 
environmental improvements, covering both resource use and product functionality according to  
our sustainability product scorecard.
The target has been modifed. All IKEA products are developed according to the Democratic Design approach where sustainability  
is one of five dimensions. 
The product score has been replaced by design principles that includes the entire range. New goals are set to align with the  
development of the new sustainability strategy. See page 12.
17 By August 2020, 90% of the total sales value will come from home furnishing products classified as 
more sustainable (according to the sustainability product scorecard). 
The target has been modifed to secure focus on providing more healthy and sustainable solutions, rather than increasing sales 
volumes. All IKEA products are developed according to the Democratic Design approach where sustainability is one of five dimensions. 
The product score has been replaced by design principles that include the entire range. See page 12.

Page 50:
50 |  INTER IKEA SUSTAINABILITY SUMMARY REPORT
TARGETS/INDICATORS PERFORMANCE FY17
18 By August 2020, 30% of the wood used by IKEA Industry will be recycled. In FY17, 1% of the total wood used by IKEA Industry was recycled. The IKEA Industry Board unit in Lure, France, produces board 
from 60% recycled material and studies have been conducted into how to do this at other board mills. However, there is not currently 
enough recycled material available in the locations where our board mills are situated to make the investments in recycling lines.  
See page 26.
19 By August 2020, close at least two material loops (material loops not currently existing in a region) 
for post-consumer waste.
We are shifting from a focus on closing loops1 to transforming IKEA into a circular business. Turning waste into new materials is one 
key element. 98% of the packaging used for IKEA products is made from renewable, recyclable or recycled materials. Plastic and 
paper packaging is made into new products such as TOMAT, SKRUTT, and TJENA. We have developed a unique production technique, 
”M-board”, to produce board material from recycled paper.
This target was modified due to the higher ambition level across the IKEA business and the shift in focus from just closing loops to a 
more holistic transformation into a circular business. See page 17.
20 By August 2020, reduce waste from store operations by 10%. 2 Please see the INGKA Holding B.V. Sustainability Summary Report for information about progress towards this target.  Read more 
about waste on page 32.
21 By August 2020, 90% of the waste from IKEA Industry Group will  
be material recycled.
On track, but it will be a challenge to reach 90% by 2020. In FY17, 82% of waste at IKEA Industry was recycled. See page 32.
Energy independence 
Strive towards energy independence through being a leader in renewable energy, and becoming more energy efficient throughout our operations and supply chain
Progress towards FY17 targets/indicators
22 Encourage and enable our direct home furnishing suppliers to become 20% more energy efficient 
in their own operations by August 2017 (compared to FY10 in relative terms, measured by kWh/m3 
purchased goods for trading operations, - IKEA Industry: kWh/m3 
- IKEA Components: kWh/kg). 
Achieved. 
 - 
 19% impr
ovement in energy efficiency at tier 1 home furnishing suppliers compared to FY13 baseline. This is within the  
margin of error of our reported data and therefore counted as achieved. 
 - Undertoo
k inititiative to help suppliers raise the SSI scores.
See page 29.
Progress towards FY18-FY20 targets/indicators
23 By August 2020, reduce transport-related carbon emissions by 30% through, for example, 
improving fill rates, utilising electric vehicles, optimal modes of transport and green corridors, 
compared to FY12, in relative terms and measured by emissions per m3 of transported goods. 
We have almost achieved the target to reduce transport related carbon emissions by 30% per m3 product sold (reached 29.5%).   
In FY17,
 
we launched a
 
transport decarbonisation programme, focused on reducing the transport needed by increasing efficiency, 
replacing the types of transport and fuels used, and rethinking our approach. For progress in retail, see INGKA Holding B.V. 
Sustainability Summary Report. See page 31.
25 By August 2020, INGKA Holding B.V. will produce as much renewable energy as  
it consumes in its operations.
See INGKA Holding B.V. Sustainability Summary Report.
 
1  Closing the loop is one approach among many in a circular economy. It is defined as when waste is 
reused into new resources such as materials and products. A company can have an internal loop where 
the waste created in its own production or end of life products is reused. This can also happen in a bigger 
context, by reusing any waste created in society. Both loops are of interest for the IKEA business.

TARGETS/INDICATORS PERFORMANCE FY17
A better life for people and communities 
Take a lead in contributing to a better life for people and communities impacted by our business, placing human rights at the centre of everything we do
Progress towards FY17 targets/indicators
26 Maintain 100% IWAY approval of all suppliers of home furnishing and other key products and 
services (suppliers related to Home Furnishing, IKEA Components, Transportation and the global 
business area Food).
On track.
Home furnishing suppliers: 98% 
Transport: 97% 
Global Food: 87% 
IKEA Components: (direct suppliers): 99%  
IKEA Industry (own sites): 100% 
IKEA Industry (direct suppliers): 46% 
IKEA Catalogue: 63%
The gap at home furnishing and transport suppliers is due to the phase out of suppliers or that an implementation extension has been 
given with a plan in place to close deviations. For other IKEA organisations, implementation plans are in place and on track to achieve 
IWAY approval at suppliers in scope. 
See page 35.
27 Secure compliance to IWAY Musts at all sub-suppliers of critical material and processes by August 
2017. Covers material and processes which have an increased risk of sustainability concerns 
associated with the raw material or how it is sourced. For example cotton, leather, wood, down & 
feathers, palm oil, natural fibres and plants.
Not achieved due to increased scope. During FY17, we updated the definition of “critical manufacturing processes” which increased the 
number of suppliers within the scope. Follow up of IWAY Must requirements at these sub-suppliers will take place in FY18.
Home furnishing suppliers: 91% of critical sub-suppliers secured with IWAY Must.  
IKEA Components: 85% of critical sub-suppliers secured with IWAY Must (goal to reach 100% in FY18).  
See page 35.
28 Develop and implement a transparent and reliable system for the responsible recruitment of 
migrant workers at first tier suppliers in identified critical areas by August 2017.
Launched phase two of our partnership with the International Organisation for Migration and Verité, to map labour recruitment  
chains from Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines to suppliers in Taiwan. We continued to work as part of the
 
Leadership 
Group for Responsible Recruitment. 
See page 37.
Progress towards FY18-FY20 Targets/Indicators
29 Continuously identify and develop setups for home-based workers to improve working conditions, 
protect labour rights and prevent child labour. By August 2020, all home based workers are 
transitioned into improved setups and part of our handmade development programme.
Ongoing. We are increasing efforts to improve the working conditions of smallholders and farmers. We will continue our work  
with home-based workers to develop natural fibre products. We are clarifying and improving the requirements, monitoring and 
governance to secure compliance.
