CEO's statement
In 2023 NEPI Rockcastle generated the highest 
dis
tributable earnings per share (DEPS) in its history, 
exceeding the previous record set in 2019. This marks not 
only a complete recovery from the 
effects of the Covid-19 
pandemic, but also a sustainable step-up in performance 
determined by continuing investments in our portfolio. 
Throughout the year we updated our guidance to the 
upside as we took note of the strong results coming in. 
Even so, the 17% increase in recurring DEPS achieved 
(9.3% on a nominal basis) exceeded our latest update.
The bedrock of our results is the operational performance 
of the pr
operty portfolio. Several factors explain the 
jump in Net Operating Income (NOI) by 21% year-
on-year to €491 million. The acquisitions made in 
late-2022 contributed significantly to performance as did 
a 13% incr
ease in like-for-like NOI. Inflation protection 
thr
ough the indexation clauses embedded in our lease 
agreements has served NEPI Rockcastle well during 
the high inflationary environment in CEE over the past 
tw
o years. Active asset management achieved rental 
uplifts averaging 8% above indexation on new lettings 
and renewals. The growth in turnover rents and short-
term income outpaced that of base rents in 2023. 
The recovery of operating expenses through tenant 
contributions improved, leading to lower unrecovered 
costs than in 2022.
The Company’s robust results were underpinned by strong 
sales fr
om our tenants and a confident CEE consumer. 
W
e saw a significant improvement in all key trading 
data, with tenant sales up 12.6% and consumer spend 
per basket rising 7.8%, while footfall was 4.6% higher. 
The strong trading performance has helped to maintain 
balance between the Company’s and our tenants’ results, 
reflected
 in a stable occupancy cost ratio (OCR) of 12.2%. 
The drop in vacancy to 2.2% further proves the appeal of 
our properties to retailers.
We continued to strengthen our balance sheet to protect 
agains
t macroeconomic risks and ensure the resources 
for future growth. To this end, we offered shareholders 
the option f
or scrip dividends, which increased liquidity 
and reduced the loan to value ratio (LTV) to 32.2%, well 
below our upper threshold of 35%. We also contracted a 
€387 million unsecured green loan from the International 
Finance Corporation (IFC) to enable the redemption of 
bonds maturing in November 2024 irrespective of the 
conditions in the capital markets. The strong operating 
performance of our properties led to a valuation uplift of 
€
165 million, overcoming a negative shift in market yields.
Sustainable growth remains a key focus for NEPI 
R
ockcastle. In 2023 we delivered Promenada Craiova in 
southern Romania, the largest new retail scheme to open 
in CEE in 2023, and completed the Group’s 
first residential 
project, both on time and on budget. Sustainability lies 
at the core of our operations and developments and we 
are making 
significant progress to reduce emissions and 
increase the energy efficiency of our assets, as part of a 
comprehensive sustainability strategy launched in 2022. 
The shining example of our progress in this area is the 
fact that we are now producing solar energy at 27 of our 
Romanian properties.
NEPI Rockcastle has delivered remarkable results in 2023. 
T
he markets that we operate in are forecast to have some 
of the strongest GDP growth in Europe in 2024, which 
bodes well not only for consumer confidence and the 
perf
ormance of our tenants, but also for NEPI Rockcastle’s 
continued growth.

Chairman's statement
NEPI Rockcastle’s results in 2023 exceeded expectations 
y
et again, setting a new record for earnings per share. 
The key driver was the operational performance of 
our properties, where we saw a solid increase in 
Net Operating Income (NOI) across all the countries, 
underpinned by rising footfall and tenant sales. The 
quality of the Group’s assets was 
confirmed by the 
s
trong interest shown by both retailers and consumers, as 
evidenced by higher occupancy and an increased number 
of visitors.
This year’s performance was supported by a more 
f
avorable macroeconomic environment in Central and 
Eastern Europe (CEE) than anticipated at the start of 
2023. Although economic growth slowed down due to 
high inflation and restrictive monetary policies prevalent 
thr
oughout the period, the region managed to avoid 
a recession and continued to outpace the Western 
European economies. Inflation rates began to decline, and 
t
ogether with falling energy and commodities prices, the 
stage has been set for more relaxed monetary conditions 
in 2024. Additionally, consumption habits in CEE continue 
to support traditional retail. Customers in our region 
were relatively undeterred by high inflation,
 compared to 
their western peers, while online retail penetration rates 
remain low.
Active asset management, delivered through an 
int
egrated in-house platform, has helped NEPI Rockcastle 
outperform most of its peers across a wide range of 
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). A sustainable growth 
mindset drives both the day-to-day operation of our 
properties and the investments we make in developments 
or acquisitions of existing assets with strong potential. 
The acquisitions made in 2022 and the developments 
completed in 2023 have already made a notable impact 
on results. We will continue to look for such opportunities 
to grow the business through accretive investments as 
well as organically.
Financially, we continued to secure the resources for 
futur
e growth, all the while being mindful of the 
challenges ahead. Our balance sheet is as strong as 
ever. For the last two half-years, we have given our 
shareholders the opportunity to acquire new shares via 
a scrip dividend, a proposition that has been taken up 
by a large majority. We also prepared the Group for 
the next material debt maturity, that of the bond issue 
expiring November 2024, by contracting a green loan 
from a syndicate led by IFC. The valuation of the Group’s 
portfolio continued to increase, which was rare among 
our peers in 20
23. The conclusion from the above is that 
the Group remains in a very solid financial position, with 
c
onservative leverage and no major unfunded obligation 
coming due in the near future.
ESG remains of utmost importance to the Company, and 
w
e continued to make significant progress in achieving 
major r
eductions in the Group’s emissions and carbon 
footprint. Sustainability is now closely connected with 
our financing, all new facilities having green features. We 
c
ompleted the installation of solar panels in almost all 
Romanian properties and started to produce green energy 
for a significant portion of our needs. The Company’s 
efforts are supported by a dedicated Sustainability 
Committee at the Board level.
I would like to thank my fellow Board members, 
management and the entir
e NEPI Rockcastle team for 
another year of great results and achievements. I am 
confident there will be more to come.

Directors' report
HIGHLIGHTS
Earnings per share beat guidance to increase by 17.1% 
(on a recurring basis)
• Distributable earnings per share (DEPS) for the second 
half (H2) of 20
23 was 28.46 euro cents, which, when 
combined with the interim DEPS of 28.52 euro cents, 
results in annual DEPS of 56.98 euro cents, 9.3% 
higher than in 2022 (52.15 euro cents).
• DEPS for 2022 included the non-recurring positive 
impact of 3.51 eur
o cents from the reversal of a 
provision for litigation related to the discontinued 
acquisition of the Serenada and Krokus shopping 
centres in Poland, recognised in 2021. On a recurring 
basis, i.e. excluding the impact of accounting for these 
litigation claims, DEPS for 2023 were 17.1% higher than 
for 2022.
• Actual DEPS growth was 2.3 percentage points higher 
than the 7% la
test guidance issued in December 2023. 
Half of the upside was due to better-than-expected 
operational results in fourth quarter (Q4) of 2023. 
The remaining portion of the upside resulted from 
€4 million lower than expected tax expenses due to 
the application of a fiscal unity regime for the Group’s 
tw
o companies domiciled in the Netherlands.
• The Board has declared a dividend of 25.61 euro 
c
ents per share for H2 2023, corresponding to 
a 90% dividend pay-out ratio, to be settled as 
capital repayment (default option). NEPI Rockcastle 
shareholders can also elect for the settlement of the 
same dividend amount as an ordinary cash dividend 
out of distributable 
profits.
Rental uplifts (including indexation), acquisitions, 
surging turnover rent and higher short-term income help 
NOI grow by 21%
• Net rental and related income (referred to as ‘Net 
Oper
ating Income’ or ‘NOI’) was up 21% from 2022 at 
€491 million. Like-for-like (LFL) NOI growth was 13% 
excluding the impact from the three acquisitions made 
in 2022.
• Gross rental income increased by 21%, from 
€422 million in 20
22 to €510 million in 2023. Base rent 
was up 18%, driven by indexation, rental uplifts and 
higher occupancy. Strong tenant sales led to a 29% 
increase in overage and turnover rent, while short-term 
income grew by 26%.
• Unrecovered operating costs declined slightly, despite 
a 25% incr
ease in property operating expenses, helped 
by better tenant recoveries (+27%).
Strong operating performance continues, with increased 
tenant sales, footfall and average spend
• Tenant turnover increased by 12.6% (excluding 
h
ypermarkets) compared to 2022 on a LFL basis. The 
growth in sales easily exceeded inflation and shows 
c
ontinuing consumer confidence.
• There were more than 337 million visits to the Group’s 
shopping c
entres in 2023, a 14.2% increase compared 
to 2022. On a LFL basis, footfall increased by 4.6% 
vs 2022.
• The average basket size went up by 7.8%, maintaining 
the tr
end of previous years and fuelling strong 
turnover growth.
• Occupancy cost ratio (OCR) was 12.2% in 2023 
(
excluding hypermarkets), almost the same as in 2022 
(12.1%), as rental uplifts and better cost recoveries 
were 
offset by higher tenant sales. OCR has been on 
a downward path since 2020 and has now stabilised at 
a sustainable level.
• The collection rate was 98% of 2023 reported 
r
evenues as of 31 December 2023, increasing to over 
99% by mid-February 2024.
Higher rents and lower vacancy drive up the fair value of 
the Group’s properties
• Investment property as of 31 December 2023 was 
v
alued at €6.8 billion, compared to €6.6 billion at 
the end of 2022. The increase is due to investments 
in developments, as well as positive fair value 
adjustments of €165 million. Investment property held 
for sale were €152 million on 31 December 2023 (up 
fr
om €19 million at the end of 2022), bringing the total 
value of the Group’s portfolio to €6.9 billion.
• The revaluation uplift was driven by higher estimated 
r
ental values, supported in turn by the excellent 
performance of the assets in 2023. Valuation yields 
increased by 15 basis points on average to reflect 
changing capital markets conditions.
• European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA) 
v
acancy decreased to 2.2%, from 2.7% in 2022. For 
retail properties the EPRA vacancy rate was 2.1% 
(down from 2.5% in the previous year).
• EPRA Net Reinstatement Value (NRV) per share 
w
as €6.98 as of 31 December 2023, a 2% increase 
c
ompared to €6.84 as of 31 December 2022, mostly 
due to the revaluation of the property portfolio.
The Group delivers on ambitious plans for 
sustainable growth
• NEPI Rockcastle invested €197 million in developments 
and cape
x expenditures in 2023 (including investment 
in residential project, Vulcan Residence), up from 
€154 million in the previous year.
• In 2023 the Group completed the development of 
Pr
omenada Craiova, a 63,700m2 Gross Leasable Area 
(
GLA) retail scheme in one of Romania’s largest 
regional cities, and Vulcan Residence, a residential 
project in Bucharest with 254 apartments. Promenada 
Craiova was the largest retail asset to open in the CEE 
region in 2023.
• Ongoing development projects include the extension 
of Pr
omenada Bucharest, the redevelopment of 
Bonarka City Center and the extension of 
Ploiesti Shopping City. Other projects are currently 
under permitting.
• A green energy program launched in 2022 continued 
with the ins
tallation of photovoltaic panels in 17 new 
locations in 2023. The Group now produces solar 
energy at 27 of its Romanian properties, ensuring ca. 
25% of those assets’ energy needs. Management is 
currently assessing a major roll out of the program, 
which could become a 
significant source of income for 
the Gr
oup in future years.

Dir ectors' report
• The Group’s sustainability objectives go well beyond 
r
enewable electricity production. In 2023 it launched 
a Sustainability-Linked Finance Framework as an 
alternative green funding approach and aligned 
its sustainability targets to the Science Based 
Targets initiative (SBTi). Both actions raise the 
standard for environmental performance that the 
Group holds itself to, by introducing new and more 
stringent commitments for emissions reduction and 
energy 
efficiency.
Conservative funding structure (LTV 32%) with 
increasingly green features
• The Group’s liquidity position as of 31 December 2023 
w
as €909 million, including €339 million in cash and 
€570 million in undrawn committed credit facilities.
• Loan-to-value (LTV) was 32.2% as of 31 December 
2023, comfortably below the strategic upper threshold 
of 3
5%.
• In December 2023 NEPI Rockcastle entered into a 
€38
7 million senior unsecured facility with the IFC, 
structured as a green loan with sustainability-linked 
features. The facility matures in January 2029 and was 
fully disbursed in February 2024. The facility gives the 
Group enough liquidity to cover almost 80% of the 
repayment of the bond maturing in November 2024.
• The average interest rate, including hedging, was 2.5% 
f
or 2023 (2.3% for 2022). Interest rates are either fixed 
or hedged for 100% of outstanding debt.
• Most of the Group’s funding (64%) as of February 
20
24 has green or sustainability-linked features.
• The Group is currently assigned a long-term corporate 
cr
edit rating of BBB (stable outlook) from Standard & 
Poor’s Rating Services and BBB+ (stable outlook) from 
Fitch Ratings.
OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Trading summary
We achieved a better than expected performance in 2023, 
aft
er a strong post-pandemic recovery in 2022, supported 
by robust consumer demand and increasing tenant 
interest for the Group’s properties. All major trading 
indicators (footfall, turnovers, average basket, occupancy) 
continued to increase steadily from the already high levels 
reached in 2022.
On a LFL basis footfall increased by 4.6% over the 
y
ear. There was positive year on year (YOY) growth 
in each quarter, the pace accelerating slightly in Q4 
(+1.9%) compared to third quarter (Q3) (+1.1%). The 
growth in traffic
 from the levels seen after fully 
reopening in 2022 post-Covid is very encouraging and 
demonstrates the strength of the CEE consumer, despite 
macroeconomic headwinds.
Tenant sales in 2023 were 12.6% higher on a LFL basis 
than in 20
22. A double-digit growth rate was achieved 
every quarter except Q3 (+8.4%), accelerating again in Q4 
when sales increased by 10.2% YOY. Customers continued 
to spend more per visit, the average basket size increasing 
by 7.8%.
The strong tenant performance allowed for a sustainable 
incr
ease in rents and expense recoveries. In 2023 OCR 
was 12.2% (excluding hypermarkets), almost the same 
as in 2022 (12.1%), a relatively low level which is both 
attractive for tenants and leaves room for further rental 
uplifts, as well as providing some protection against 
possible future cost increases.

 ockcastle N.V.

Page 17:
Tenant sales increased in all retail categories monitored by 
the Gr
oup. The strongest YOY performers were Health and 
Beauty (+24.4%) and Services (+23.9%). Entertainment 
did very well too, as the production of movie blockbusters 
resumed. Fashion, the largest segment, had one of the 
lowest growth rates of all categories but was still solid 
at 8.4%.
Energy costs and overall cost inflation continued to 
be r
elatively high throughout most of 2023 despite a 
reduction in the second half of the year. This pushed 
up property operating expenses by 25% YOY but was 
offset by improved recovery, which reached 93% in 2023 
(compared to 91% in 2022). As a result, unrecovered 
expenses decreased slightly from €19.5 million in 2022 to 
€18.9 million in 2023.
Leasing
Strong tenant demand for space in the Group’s properties 
led t
o a decrease in EPRA vacancy to 2.2% at the end 
of 2023 (from 2.7% on 31 December 2022). For retail 
pr
operties, vacancy was 2.1% (down from 2.5%), while 
office and industrial properties had a vacancy rate of 10.1% 
(compared to 13.0% in 2022).
NEPI Rockcastle concluded 461 new leases (for 
100
,600m2, 5% of total GLA) in 2023. International tenants 
ac
counted for 57% of new leases signed. Another 846 
leases (188,100m2 of GLA) were renewed during the year.
The average rental uplift in 2023 was 8.1% (excluding 
inde
xation), supported by asset management initiatives 
(e.g. re-sizing, merging of units etc.). The base rental uplift 
on renewals and reletting on a LFL basis was 7.2%.
New stores opened in 2023 include Zara (Promenada 
Cr
aiova and Serdika Center), Lefties (Promenada Craiova), 
Reserved (Ploiesti Shopping City), Sinsay (Paradise 
Center), Half Price (Karolinka Shopping Centre).
DEVELOPMENT UPDATE
During 2023, the Group invested approximately 
€
197 million in developments and capex.
The largest development project completed by NEPI 
R
ockcastle in 2023, Promenada Craiova, opened to the 
public in October. Craiova is the largest city in the 
south-west of Romania, with a population of ca. 250,000 
inhabitants. Comprising a shopping centre of 53,700m2 
GLA and a retail park of 10,000m2 GLA, the property 
is the lar
gest retail asset to open in CEE in 2023. It 
is also the Group’s first development where renewable 
ener
gy production was integrated over the parking areas, 
supplying 70% of the energy needed by the shopping 
centre and its tenants. Construction started in February 
2022. A wide range of international brands opened stores 
in Promenada Craiova, including the first Lefties (an 
Indit
ex value brand) store in CEE.
The installation of photovoltaic panels on Romanian 
pr
operties continued as planned in 2023. By the year 
end, the Group had built a total installed power capacity 
of 36 MW and was producing green energy in 27 
locations. Management is now assessing options to 
expand the project.
Vulcan Residence in Bucharest, NEPI Rockcastle’s first 
residential project, was also completed in 2023. Out of the 
254 apartments (with a t
otal area of 18,300m2), 186 have 
been sold.
NEPI Rockcastle has a very promising development 
pipeline
, with a total current cost of over €600 million 
(including extensions and redevelopments of existing 
assets together with the rollout of the green energy 
investment), which is expected to deliver significant 
growth over the coming years. All ongoing development 
pr
ojects are on track for completion within the 
envisaged schedule.
SUSTAINABILITY FOCUS
Environmental initiatives
In 2023, NEPI Rockcastle achieved substantial progress 
t
owards reaching its ambitious sustainability objectives:
• The Group’s ESG ratings continued to improve, with 
Sus
tainalytics updating its risk rating from Low to 
Negligible, while the GRESB score increased by one 
notch, from two to three stars, in both operations 
and developments.
• Photovoltaic plants were installed in 27 locations 
acr
oss Romanian properties (17 more than at the end 
of 2022).
• The Group has affirmed its commitment to a net zero 
path, based on SBTi-aligned targets.
• NEPI Rockcastle has updated its Green Financing 
Fr
amework (GFF) with the introduction of more 
stringent eligibility criteria for financing or refinancing 
the assets or expenditures defined as “Eligible 
Gr
een Projects” and has launched its Sustainability-
Linked Finance Framework as an alternative green 
funding approach.
• LED lights have been implemented in 91% of the 
Gr
oup’s properties (by GLA).
Corporate governance
The Group applied for a Dutch fiscal unity regime for 
its tw
o companies domiciled in the Netherlands (NEPI 
Rockcastle N.V. and NE Property B.V.) after the relocation 
of the parent company to the Netherlands in September 
2022. The decision on the 
fiscal unity regime was granted 
in 2023 with retroactive effect from the relocation date of 
the parent company (6 September 2022). Consequently,

Funding and liability management
In March 2023 the Group concluded a €200 million 
sec
ured green loan which matures in June 2028. The loan 
proceeds were used to repay the revolving credit facilities 
utilised for the acquisition of Forum Gdansk Shopping 
Center and Copernicus Shopping Centre, restoring the 
revolving facility capacity.
In 2023, NEPI Rockcastle extended the contractual 
ma
turities related to unsecured committed revolving 
credit facilities as follows:
• the revolving credit facility from BRD-Groupe Société 
Génér
ale and Garanti Bank was extended for one year, 
until July 2026, with the maximum principal available 
maintained at €170 million;
• the revolving credit facility from ING Bank was 
e
xtended for one year, until July 2026, with 
the maximum principal available maintained at 
€100 million; and
• the revolving credit facility from a three-bank 
s
yndicate lead by Deutsche Bank AG as arranger, 
was extended for three years, until January 2027, 
with the maximum principal available decreased to 
€150 million.
A total of €570 million of available unsecured 
c
ommitted revolving credit facilities remain undrawn as 
at 31 December 2023 including the above committed 
r
evolving credit facilities together with the revolving credit 
facility of a maximum limit of €150 million with Raiffeisen 
Bank International.
In February 2024, the Group extended the maturity of the 
r
evolving credit facility with Raiffeisen Bank International 
until January 20
27 and increased the maximum limit to 
€196 million, with Erste Group Bank joining the facility. 
Consequently, the revolving credit facilities’ capacity 
reached €616 million.

In December 2023, NEPI Rockcastle entered into a 
€38
7 million green financing agreement with the IFC, 
a member of the World Bank Group and the largest 
global development institution focused on the private 
sector in emerging markets. The senior unsecured facility 
is structured as a green loan with sustainability-linked 
features, aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
and increasing energy efficiency in the Group’s property 
portf
olio. The facility matures in January 2029 and was 
disbursed in February 2024. The facility has been put in 
place to cater for the repayment of the upcoming bond 
maturing in November 2024.
The Group continually evaluates its financing options, 
including debt and equity capital r
aising alternatives, to 
support its future growth. NEPI Rockcastle will assess 
market opportunities as they arise, while keeping in mind 
the strategic objective to broaden its shareholder base 
and maintain an optimal capital structure.
Cost of debt
The average interest rate of the Group’s debt, 
including hedging, w
as approximately 2.5% during 2023 
(2022: 2.3%).
As of 31 December  2023, fixed-coupon bonds represented 
7
8% of NEPI Rockcastle’s outstanding debt. Out of the 
remaining long-term debt exposed to Euribor, 79% was 
hedged with interest rate caps and 21% with interest 
rate swaps.
EARNINGS DISTRIBUTION 2023
The Board has declared a dividend of 25.61 euro cents 
per shar
e for H2 2023, corresponding to a 90% dividend 
pay-out ratio, to be settled as capital repayment (default 
option). NEPI Rockcastle shareholders can also elect for 
the settlement of the same dividend amount as ordinary 
cash dividend out of distributable profits.
In line with Dutch legislation, the capital repayment will 
be paid t
o shareholders unless they elect to receive the 
ordinary cash dividend option.
A circular containing full details of the dividend 
settlement, ac
companied by announcements on the Stock 
Exchange News Service (SENS) of the JSE, A2X and 
Euronext Amsterdam has been issued on 27 February 
2024, with the dividend settlement scheduled for 
12 April
 2024.
PROSPECTS AND EARNINGS GUIDANCE
Distributable earnings per share for 2024 are expected to 
be appr
oximately 4% higher than the 2023 distributable 
earnings per share of 56.98 euro cents, with no change 
in the Company’s current 90% dividend payout ratio. 
This guidance does not consider the impact of potential 
further political instability in the region, or systemic 
macroeconomic disruptions, and assumes a continuation 
of the trading trends observed to date. This guidance 
can be 
modified or withdrawn in the future if material 
changes unf
old.
This guidance has not been reviewed or reported on by 
NEPI R
ockcastle’s auditors and is the responsibility of the 
Board of Directors.

PRESERVE A HIGH-QUALITY PORTFOLIO OF DOMINANT ASSETS
Active property management of the Group assets 
cr
eates significant growth opportunities. Capitalising on 
its comprehensive in-house expertise in the CEE retail 
markets, the Group delivers year on year best-in-class 
results, such as high collection and occupancy rates, 
reasonable tenant occupancy cost, growing tenant sales 
and footfall. Preventive maintenance decreases long-term 
capital expenditure, service charge levels, non-recoverable 
e
xpenses and maintains the portfolio in good shape. With 
a broad platform across nine CEE countries, the Group 
manages to adapt its business to the changing consumer 
preferences and to build strong, trust-based relationships 
with leading retailers.
DELIVERING ON THE DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE
NEPI Rockcastle pursues low-risk development, 
r
edevelopment and extension opportunities, in a non-
speculative, phased manner. Construction costs are 
committed to on a gradual basis, in line with leasing 
milestones, but at the same time secured to mitigate 
the 
inflationary trends and the supply chains recent 
challenges. Delivering on its strategy, the Group has 
close to 170,000m2 GLA under construction or permitting, 
tr
anslating to a €652 million pipeline to be delivered 
during 2024-2028.
EXPANDING AND STRENGTHENING THE PORTFOLIO NET OPERATING INCOME
The Group is committed to invest selectively in assets 
tha
t meet its rigorous investment criteria. Pursued retail 
assets must already be or have the potential to become 
dominant. Size is critical to achieve a comprehensive 
offering
 and an optimum tenant mix, including a large 
proportion of food and fashion anchors and substantial 
leisure and entertainment area.
Good location, access, visibility, design and technical 
specifications, as well as a potential for extension, 
r
educe the threat of significant competition and enable 
the asset’s dominance in its catchment area. Based 
on consistently delivering against its strategic focus, 
the Group added €36 million Net Operating Income 
to the property portfolio in 2023, from its acquisitions 
completed in late 2022 in Poland and Romania.

FINANCIAL STABILITY
The Group financing strategy relies on maintaining a 
strong financial discipline, revolving around an adequate 
liquidity, conservative LTV, and a diverse debt structure, 
to support business growth. Growth is funded through a 
combination of secured and unsecured bank debt with 
unsecured bonds. The Group prioritises its investment 
grade credit rating and its green portfolio 
profile, 
to maintain diversity and optionality in its financing 
sources, and optimise the cost of debt. Delivering on 
its financing strategy during 2023, the Group kept a 
LTV level of 32.2%,below the strategic threshold of 35% 
and comfortably within debt covenants, while ensuring 
an adequate maturity profile, with all significant debt 
ma
turities covered until the end of 2025.
ESG FOCUS
NEPI Rockcastle makes a commitment to invest into 
initia
tives that will not only enable it to meet ESG 
goals, but will also generate a positive bottom-line 
impact, recognising the synergies between responsible 
citizenship and 
profitability. The Group formulated a 
dedicated sustainability strategy, focused on three main 
directions: investing in healthy and sustainable buildings, 
be a trusted partner for stakeholders and creating an 
attractive, professional and ethical work environment.
In line with its strategic directions, the Group continued 
its c
ommitment to keep a BREEAM-certified retail and 
office portfolio and planned significant investment in on-
site renewable energy production that started in 2022, 
continued in 2023 and will be carried forward into 2024 
and beyond.

V per the IFRS financial statements to provide 
stakeholders with the most relevant information on the 
fair value of the assets and liabilities of a real estate 
investment company, under different scenarios.
In replacement of the EPRA NAV and EPRA NNNAV, new 
r
eporting standards introduced three new measures of 
net asset value: EPRA Net Reinstatement Value (NRV), 
EPRA Net T
angible Assets Value (NTA) and EPRA Net 
Disposal Value (NDV). As recommended by EPRA, these 
new standards have been applied with effect from 2020 
first-half results.
EPRA NET REINSTATEMENT VALUE (NRV)
The objective of the EPRA Net Reinstatement Value 
measur
e is to highlight the value of net assets on a long-
term basis. Assets and liabilities that are not expected to 
crystallise in normal circumstances such as the fair value 
movements on financial derivatives and deferred taxes 
on pr
operty valuation surpluses are therefore excluded. 
Since the aim of the metric is to also reflect what 
would be needed to recreate the company through the 
investment markets based on its current capital and 
financing structure, related costs such as real estate 
transfer taxes should be included.
EPRA NET TANGIBLE ASSETS (NTA)
The underlying assumption behind the EPRA Net Tangible 
As
sets calculation assumes entities buy and sell assets, 
thereby crystallising certain levels of deferred tax liability.
EPRA NET DISPOSAL VALUE (NDV)
The EPRA Net Disposal Value provides the reader with 
a sc
enario where deferred tax, financial instruments, 
and certain other adjustments are calculated as to the 
full extent of their liability, including tax exposure not 
reflected
 in the Balance Sheet, net of any resulting tax. 
This measure should not be viewed as a “liquidation NAV” 
because, in many cases, fair values do not represent 
liquidation values.

r
equirements please refer to the

EPRA NIY AND “TOPPED-UP” NIY
The EPRA Net Initial Yield (NIY) is calculated as the 
annualised r
ental income based on passing cash rents, less 
non-recoverable property operating expenses, divided by 
the gross market value of the property.
In EPRA “topped-up” NIY, the net rental income is 
“t
opped-up” to reflect rent after the expiry of lease 
inc
entives such as rent-free periods and rental discounts.

EPRA VACANCY RATE
The EPRA Vacancy Rate estimates the percentage of the 
t
otal potential rental income not received due to vacancy.
The EPRA Vacancy Rate is calculated by dividing 
the es
timated rental value of vacant premises by the 
estimated rental value of the entire property portfolio 
if all pr
emises were fully leased. The EPRA vacancy 
rate is calculated using valuation reports performed by 
independent experts.

EPRA COST RATIO
EPRA Cost ratios reflect the relevant administrative 
and operating costs of the business and provide a 
recognised and understood reference point for analysis of 
a company’s costs.
The EPRA Cost ratio (including direct vacancy costs) 
includes all adminis
trative and operating expenses in the 
IFRS statements including the share of joint ventures’ 
administrative and operating expenses (net of any 
service fees).
The EPRA Cost ratio (excluding direct vacancy costs) is 
calc
ulated as above, but with an adjustment to exclude 
vacancy costs.
Both EPRA Cost ratios are calculated as a percentage 
of Gr
oss rental income including a share of joint venture 
Gross rental income. The ground rent costs are nil for the 
Group and for its joint ventures.

EPRA Cost ratio (including direct vacancy costs)1 10.2% 11.7%
EPRA Cost ratio (excluding direct vacancy costs)1 10.1% 11.6%
1 EPRA cost ratio decreased due to higher gross rental income and slightly lower unrecovered operating costs, which offsets the increase in the administrative 
e
xpenses. Gross rental income increase is driven from the three acquisitions made in 2022, indexation, rental uplifts, and higher occupancy

EPRA LOAN-TO-VALUE (EPRA LTV)
The LTV ratio is an important metric that assesses the 
lending risk a lender bears b
y providing a loan as per 
the borrower's requirement and it shows the relation of 
debt to the fair value of the assets. NEPI Rockcastle 
has chosen to disclose, amoung other indicators, the 
EPRA LTV ratio, calculated in accordance with EPRA Best 
Practices Recommendations.
There are a few changes compared to existing LTVs. 
One of the main ones is tha
t the current net receivables/
payables amount is included in the calculation of EPRA 
L
TV. Another change involves the EPRA LTV to be 
calculated on a proportionate consolidation basis. This 
implies that the EPRA LTV includes the Groups share in 
the net debt and net assets of joint venture or material 
associates. As the Group is not part of any joint venture 
agreement, this requirement of the EPRA LTV does not 
impact the calculation.

Core leadership principles at Board level
The Board adopts best practice governance policies 
designed t
o align the interests of the Board and 
management with those of the stakeholders, and promote 
the highest standards of ethical behaviour and risk 
management. The members of the Board individually 
and collectively cultivate a strong set of values and lead 
by example.
Integrity
• Directors act in good faith and in the best interests of 
the or
ganisation

voided, it needs to be disclosed to the 
whole Board and proactively managed as determined 
by the Board, subject to legal provisions
• Directors act ethically, beyond mere legal compliance
• Directors set the tone for an ethical 
or
ganisational culture
Competence
• Directors ensure they are sufficiently knowledgeable 
about the organisation, industry and funds it uses and 
affects,
 as well as key laws, rules, codes and standards
• Directors act with due care, skill and diligence, and 
tak
e reasonable steps to be informed about matters

proper and speciﬁc authority, or unless there is a legal 
or professional duty to do so
• Conﬁdential information is not used to the personal 
adv
antage of Directors or any third parties
Strategic oversight
In carrying out their oversight role, the Board actively 
engages in setting the long-t
erm strategic goals of the 
organisation, reviews and approves business strategies, 
corporate ﬁnancial objectives, ﬁnancial and funding plans 
(ensuring consistency with strategic goals) and monitors 
the Group's performance in executing such strategies.
The Group has a robust strategic framework for long-term 
v
alue creation, that has been reviewed and endorsed 
by the Board. The Board is essential in helping the 
Company articulate and pursue its purpose, with a focus 
on addressing issues increasingly important to investors, 
c
ommunities it operates in, clients and consumers. 
The Board strongly believes that the Company's 
ability to design a strong long-term strategy and to 
manage environmental, social and governance matters, 
demonstrates the good governance ultimately required 
to achieve sustainable growth and to secure the mere 
existence of the Company in the long-term.
The Group's strategy is designed and proposed by the 
management t
eam and adopted by the Board. It is 
structured around major strategic directions, with each 
of the directions further drilled down to more granular 
objectives. The Board takes an active role in monitoring 
how the Company is achieving its strategic objectives.
Role of the Board
The Board assumes collective responsibility for directing, 
go
verning and controlling the Group, while providing 
effective corporate governance, promoting an ethical 
c
orporate culture and overseeing that the organisation is 
a responsible corporate citizen. Furthermore, the Board 
acts as a link between the stakeholders and the Group by 
ensuring transparent and effective communication.
A clear division of responsibilities at Board level is in place 
t
o ensure a balance of power and authority, including 
between the roles of Chairman, Lead Independent 
Director and Chief Executive Officer, roles which are 
clearly deﬁned and segr
egated. This was designed to 
ensure that, either at Board or management level, 
no individual can hold single and unlimited control 
over signiﬁcant decision making processes. The Board 
delegates to management the authority and responsibility 
for day-to-day affairs and operations while reviewing 
management's perf
ormance.
The Board meets regularly, at least four times a year, 
and is r
esponsible for setting the Group's strategy, 
approving major matters, governing risk management 
processes and monitoring the overall Group performance. 
Moreover, the Board oversees the overall effectiveness 
of the internal controls framework, which is designed 
t
o ensure that assets are appropriately safeguarded, 
operations are run efficiently, effectively and economically, 
pr
oper accounting records are maintained, the published 
ﬁnancial information is reliable, laws and regulations are 
complied with.
No external advisors attend Board meetings on a regular 
basis, but the
y can be invited on an ad-hoc basis for 
various topics, as the Chairman deems necessary.
The Board holds two fundamental roles: decision making 
and o
versight.
The decision-making role is exercised through the 
f
ormulation or approval of fundamental policies and 
strategic goals and the approval of signiﬁcant actions in 
relation to implementing the Group's strategy.
The oversight role concerns the review of significant 
management decisions, monitoring performance, 
o
verseeing the adequacy of systems and internal controls,

Board appointments
In accordance with the Articles of Association, 
Dir
ectors are appointed, suspended or removed by the 
shareholders. Appointment is made based on the Board’s 
binding nomination, which can be deprived of its binding 
character by the shareholders decision. The Board can 
suspend Ex
ecutive Directors, while the suspension can be 
lifted by the shareholders.
To facilitate the Board’s regular refreshing, the Group 
has a r
etiring-by-rotation policy, which means that each 
year, at least one third of Directors retire by rotation 
and may stand for re-appointment by the shareholders. 
Therefore, within a three-year period, all Directors retire at 
least once.
The Board appointments are conducted in a formal and 
tr
ansparent manner following recommendations made by 
the Nomination Committee to the Board. Candidates’ 
profiles
 are carefully analysed and the Board considers 
whether they have the necessary background, experience, 
competencies, independence and diversity, as set out in 
the Board 
Profile Paper and in the Group Diversity Policy. 
High-profile and experienced recruitment agencies may 
be used to identify and assess new Director candidates, 
based on the decision of the Nomination Committee. The 
candidates’ background and references are analysed, and 
multiple information sources are used for the assessment.
The independence of every newly proposed Director is 
as
sessed by the Nomination Committee and presented to 
the Board, as well as reassessed annually, based on clear 
criteria deﬁned in the Corporate Governance Framework, 
formalised and approved by the Board.
A formal onboarding programme is in place when new 
Dir
ectors join the Company, under the close coordination 
of the Chairman of the Board, with support from the CEO 
and the Company Secretary. The onboarding programme 
is designed to help the new Director become familiar 
with the Group’s business, strategy, policies and structure, 
as well as the operational approach in the Board and 
Committees activity. The programme covers general 
ﬁnancial, social and legal affairs and ﬁnancial reporting, 
as w
ell as aspects that are specific to the Group and 
its busines
s.
NEPI Rockcastle is governed by a one-tier Board 
s
tructure, which comprises a mix of non-Executive and 
Executive Directors. Non-Executive Directors are key 
advisors to management, counselling on the strategic 
direction, while taking into account business opportunities 
and the Group’s risk appetite.
In order to ensure that the Directors’ varied backgrounds 
and e
xperience provide NEPI Rockcastle with an 
appropriate combination of knowledge and expertise 
that is necessary to manage the business 
effectively, 
the Group developed a Board Proﬁle Paper. The paper 
describes the c
ompetencies, expertise and background 
expected from the Directors individually, as well as the 
Committees and the Board, collectively. It also sets out 
principles of diversity, independence, and representation 
of Executive versus non-Executive Directors. The Group 
Diversity Policy was formalised in 2022 to align to Dutch 
legislation. It applies to the Board and management, 
and strives to ensure that no team, business function or 
management level comprises more than 70% of the same 
gender or age group.
Annual Report 2023 83

Page 84:
» continued
C orporate governance
During 2023, 33% of the Executive Directors and 
12.5% of the non-Ex
ecutive Directors were female. New 
appointments of non-Executive Directors will be made 
considering the formulated Diversity Policy, with a view to 
positively contribute to the diversity quota. Management 
Board (i.e. Executive Directors) composition is in line with 
the Diversity Policy provisions, therefore no additional 
short-term measures are envisaged by the Group. Senior 
management composition, i.e. function leads (described 
and detailed under ExCo category in the Sustainability 
Report section of the Annual Report) is in line with the 
Diversity Policy provisions as well (with 38% female – 62 
% male), therefore no additional short-term measures are 
planned by the Group.
When examining Board composition, the Group 
appr
oaches diversity in a broad sense, covering factors 
such as nationality, gender, age, education and work 
background. The Group defined a diversity matrix, which 
pr
ovides a clear overview and monitors diversity in 
the Board.
On 31 December 2023, the Board, based on an annual self-
as
sessment of the Group’s current set-up and needs, was 
satisfied with the skill set, mix of knowledge and diversity 
of c
ulture and background of its Directors.

Independent non-Executive Directors play a crucial role 
in acting as a sounding panel t

the non-Independent, non-Executive Directors, ensuring 
Board discussions and decisions are conducted in an 
objective manner and in the best interest of the Group.
Speciﬁc guidance provided by King IV and the Dutch 
C
orporate Governance Code has been followed by 
the Group in establishing, in its Corporate Governance 
Framework, the criteria for evaluating the Directors’ 
independence on an annual basis.
The following criteria have been used by the Nomination 
C
ommittee to assess the independence of the Board’s 
non-Executive Directors for 2023. The Director or close 
family members:
1. have not been an employee or Executive Director 
of NEPI R
ockcastle (including associated companies, 
in the five years prior to the appointment) or have 
temporarily performed management duties during the 
pr
evious twelve months in the absence or incapacity 
of any Executive Director;
2. have not received personal financial compensation 
from NEPI Rockcastle or a company associated with 
it (including by participating in the Group’s share 
incentive scheme), contingent on Group performance 
and in so far as this is not in the normal course of the 
business, other than the 
fixed compensation received 
f
or the work performed as a board member;
3. have not had an important business relationship with 
NEPI R
ockcastle or a company associated with it in 
the year prior to the appointment (note: this includes 
in any event the case where the board member, or 
the firm of which he/she is a shareholder, partner, 
associate or advisor, has acted as advisor to NEPI 
Rockcastle - consultant, civil notary or lawyer - and the 
case where the board member is a management board 
member or an employee of a bank with which NEPI 
Rockcastle has a lasting and significant relationship);

The independence assessment criteria were applied to all 
non-Executive Directors and only one in eight Directors 
did not meet all independence criteria. There is only 
one Director nominated by shareholders that represent 
more than 10% in the Company’s shares and voting 
rights, Mr Steven Brown, who is also the CEO of Fortress 
Real Estate Investments Limited. The Board considers 
tha
t the independence provisions required by the Dutch 
Corporate Governance Code and King IV were complied 
with during the non-Executive Directors independence 
assessment. As a result, Mr Steven Brown is considered 
a non-Independent non-Executive Director.

The Board of Directors had a stable structure in 2023, 
with no changes. All Dir
ectors were appointed by 
shareholders in 2022, for a 4-year term of office.
Within this period, the Group also applies a three 
y
ear rotation period, i.e. every year one third of the 
appointed Directors retire so that the shareholders have 
the opportunity to vote on their further reappointment.

Development, evaluation and succession planning
In accordance with the Corporate Governance Framework, 
the Boar
d ensures that its performance, proﬁle, 
composition, competences and expertise, and those of its 
Committees, its Chair and individual members, support 
continued improvement.
The Board Evaluation for 2023 was organised according 
with the C
orporate Governance Framework. The Group 
has engaged the professional services of the top-tier 
international consultant Korn Ferry International – which 
coordinated, alongside the Chairman and the HR Director, 
the roll-out of a sound and professional process. 
T
he process covered engagement with all relevant 
stakeholders, objectivity and inclusiveness, confidentiality, 
anonymity and full traceability. The project was planned 
and deliv
ered to ensure that Board member is able to 
express views confidentially, hence contributing to the 
quality of the functioning of the Board overall. The phases 
of the process were the following:
• individual discussion with the Chairman to clarify 
sc
ope, approach and content of the review
90 NEPI R ockcastle N.V.

Page 91:
• assessment questionnaire covering all important Board 
perf
ormance areas in focus
• one-on-one interviews with all the Directors and the 
Boar
d Secretary
• sharing and acknowledgement of results with 
all Dir
ectors
The evaluation covered the following considerations:
• structure and composition of the Board and 
C
ommittees, including diversity, expertise and mix 
of skills
• efficiency and transparency of operations, processes 
and routines, including the quality of the 
decision-making process, dynamics, teamwork and 
collaboration, the display of ethical values, 
independence, autonomy, objectivity
• Board contribution to key areas such as strategy, 
perf
ormance monitoring, evaluation, compensation 
and succession, corporate governance and 
risk management
The Board and Committees activity has been evaluated 
as rigor
ous, valuable and aligned to their mandate, the 
Committees Charters and the Corporate Governance 
Framework, while no 
significant improvement areas have 
been pointed out.
The results have improved as compared to the previous 
e
valuation, and the overall score was above average 
across the Board. The Chairman’s evaluation was also 
positive, above the average of the overall scores.
Keeping up to date with trends, industry-speciﬁcs, 
r
egulatory frameworks, economic, social and governance 
topics, providing inspirational and strategic leadership 
and contribution, succession for the top management 
and the Board, are a key priority and the Directors’ 
development programme included dedicated sessions 
covering such areas.
A formal succession process is in place to ensure the 
critical e
xecutive and board positions and to ensure any 
changes in the teams compliment the knowledge and 
experience at Board level. Succession planning includes:
• identifying the knowledge, skills and experience the 
Boar
d should collectively possess to effectively fulﬁl 
its r
oles and responsibilities
• ensuring an appropriate balance in terms of diversity, 
e
xpertise and knowledge among the Directors, in 
accordance with the Board Proﬁle Paper
• identifying qualiﬁed individuals suitable for nomination 
and r
ecommending them to the shareholders at 
the AGM
• achieving continuity through a smooth succession 
of Dir
ectors (including Board and Committees 
leadership) that balances perspective and 
independence with experience and knowledge
• satisfying compliance within the legal and regulatory 
fr
amework applicable to the Group
Directors’ dealings and related 
party tr
ansactions
Dealing in Company’s securities by Directors, their 
as
sociates and key Group employees, is regulated and 
monitored in accordance with the applicable stock 
exchange listing requirements, guidelines, legislation, 
regulations and directives.
To prevent the risk of insider trading and to ensure that 
none of the r
estricted persons abuse, and do not place 
themselves under suspicion of abusing inside privileged 
information, the Group has adopted a formal Dealing 
Code, available and communicated to all employees 
and Directors. The Dealing Code sets out obligations 
for the Group’s Directors, managers, staff and persons 
closely as
sociated with them, under the Market Abuse 
Regulation and stock exchange listing requirements and 
guidelines, regarding clearance to deal and notiﬁcations of 
transactions in the Group’s securities. The Group prohibits 
all Directors and employees from using conﬁdential 
information, not generally known or available to the 
public, for personal beneﬁt.
NEPI Rockcastle maintains a closed period from the end 
of a ﬁnancial period until publica
tion of the ﬁnancial 
results for that period and a prohibited period when 
sensitive information not yet publicly available is known 
by the Company’s employees or Directors. The Group 
announces closed and other prohibited periods to its 
employees and the Company’s Directors, and, during such 
periods, all those with insider knowledge are banned 
from dealing.
In compliance with JSE Listings Requirements, the 
C
ompany announces publicly all its Directors’ dealings in 
the Company’s securities, through SENS.
Directors’ and Directors’ associates interests are disclosed 
in line with the Declar
ation of Interests Policy. Directors’ 
direct and indirect holdings as of year-end are disclosed 
in the Annual Report. Moreover, the Group formalised 
also its Related party transactions policy, in line with 
JSE Listings Requirements and applicable international 
accounting standards.
According to the Group Code of Ethics, Board members 
ar
e alert to conﬂicts of interest and ethical conduct and 
should generally refrain from the following:
• engaging in personal business that may compete with 
the Gr
oup
• demanding or accepting substantial gifts from the 
Gr
oup or from any of its employees or partners, for 
themselves or their spouse, registered partner or other 
life companion, foster child or relative by blood or 
marriage up to the second degree
• providing unjustiﬁed advantages to third parties at the 
Gr
oup’s expense
• taking advantage of business opportunities that the 
Gr
oup would be entitled to
• allowing in any other way the inﬂuence of third parties 
t
o compromise or override independent judgement
• using conﬁdential information related to the Group for 
their o
wn personal beneﬁt

• taking advantage of their position as Directors to earn

Related party transactions will be entered into, only if 
beneficial to the Group entities and on the customary 
market terms that they would have been concluded 
with an independent party. The Group ensures that 
identification, negotiation, conclusion of related party 
transactions by Group entities are governed by:
• fairness
• objectivity
• arm's length principle
• proper record keeping
The Group Code of Ethics and the Declaration of 
Int

Directors, personnel, contractors, freelancers and other 
collaborators, and each are reminded in the context of 
related party transactions of their obligations to identify,

could conflict or even appear to conflict with the interests

meeting. Any potential conﬂict of interest would be 
declared and discussed in the Board meeting. The Board 
needs to decide on the measures to be implemented 
and the degree of further involvement of the respective 
Director in the matter at hand. Any actual conﬂict of 
interest deemed signiﬁcant by the Board during the 
year would be disclosed in the Annual Report. Such 
information considers, but is not limited to, related party

tha
t the Group complies with statutory and regulatory

ne
w members, development programmes, training and

e
xperience and support provided by the Company 
Secretary in 2023.
Delegation to Committees
Without abdicating accountability, the Board delegates 
c
ertain functions to certain committees. The following 
requirements are considered when appointing committee 
roles, in line with the governance framework:
• the Chairman of the Audit and the Remuneration 
C
ommittees must be an Independent Director
• the Nomination Committee should only consist of 
non-Ex
ecutive Directors, and the majority should 
be independent
• the Remuneration Committee should consist of non-
Ex
ecutive Directors, in majority independent
• directors who are not members of a Committee may 
a
ttend meetings to gain/offer information, but will 
not v
ote
• the CEO cannot be a member of the Remuneration, 
A
udit or Nomination Committees, but may attend by 
invitation their meetings
The Board considers the allocation of roles and 
r
esponsibilities and the composition of membership 
across committees holistically, to achieve the following:
• effective collaboration through cross-membership 
between Committees where required, coordinated 
timing of meetings and avoidance of duplication or 
fragmented functioning in so far as possible
• where more than one committee has jurisdiction to 
deal with a speciﬁc ma
tter, the role and positioning 
of each committee in relation to such matter 
are deﬁned, to ensure complementary rather than 
competing approaches
• a balanced distribution of power in respect to 
membership acr
oss committees, so that no individual 
would dominate the decision-making process and no 
undue reliance would be placed on a single individual

At the General Meeting, each share carries one vote and 
r
esolutions must be adopted by an absolute majority, 
unless a greater majority is required. A quorum of 
at least three shareholders with 25% voting rights is 
required, and votes can be cast by electronic means 
or by mail. If a quorum is not present at a General 
Meeting, the Board is authorised to call for a new General 
Meeting where resolutions can be passed regardless of 
the capital represented in the meeting. The structure 
of the Company's capital has been presented in this 
Report, each share carrying a right to vote in accordance 
with the Articles of Association of the Company and 
the applicable law. There are no classes of shares; no 
special restrictions on transfers; no special control rights; 
no agreements between shareholders which are known 
to the Company and may result in restrictions on the 
transfer of securities and/or voting rights; no significant 
agreements to which the company is a party and which 
tak
e effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control 
of the Company following a takeover bid, and the effects 
thereof; no agreements between the company and its 
boar
d members or employees providing for compensation 
if they resign or are made redundant without valid reason 
or if their employment ceases because of a takeover bid.
INTERNAL CONTROLS AND COMPLIANCE 
MANA
GEMENT SYSTEM
The Group is following the Committee of Sponsoring 
Or
ganisations of the Treadway Commissions (COSO) 
principles in deﬁning its internal controls system and 
enterprise risk management framework.
It applies the three lines of defence approach, with a view 
t
o further strengthen the system of internal controls and 
track compliance with relevant laws and regulations. As 
such, the system of internal controls is structured on the 
following lines:
• the first line of defence, line management (senior 
management, local management), is the function tha
t 
owns risk and is responsible for operational processes 
within the Group. Line management is in charge 
of deﬁning guidelines, implementing and executing 
internal controls, embedding risk management in 
the day-to-day operations, comparing performance 
agains
t targets, monitoring achievement
• the second line of defence has an oversight and 
c
ompliance monitoring role, and consists of functions 
such as Compliance, Risk Management and Data 
Privacy. These functions are primarily involved in 
monitoring laws, regulations and emerging risks, 
and providing support and advice to management 
in ensuring compliance thereof. They monitor and 
facilitate the implementation of effective risk and 
c
ompliance management practices and assist the 
risk owners in reporting adequate risk information. 
In the consideration of their monitoring role, they 
recommend new controls or risk mitigating measures 
to be embedded in current processes and practices
• the third line of defence, Internal Audit, is in charge of 
pr
oviding independent assurance on the effectiveness 
of the internal controls and risk management, 
including on ho
w the ﬁrst two lines discharge 
their duties.

A risk-based approach, the proportionality principle and 
segr
egation of duties are considered when developing all 
the policies and procedures at Group level, covering:
• efficiency, effectiveness, economy of operations
• safeguarding of assets
• reliability of ﬁnancial reports
• compliance with laws and regulations
INTERNAL AUDIT
The Group has an inhouse Internal Audit function. The 
activity of Int
ernal Audit, its mandate, responsibilities and 
access are regulated through the Internal Audit Charter, 
endorsed by the Audit Committee and approved by the 
Board. In accordance with its Audit Charter, Internal Audit 
reports functionally to the Audit Committee.
Internal Audit is centralised at Group level and has 
unr
estricted access to Company's resources, information 
and people, to effectively discharge its responsibilities, 
with no r
estrictions placed upon the scope of work.

C orporate governance
The function carries out independent risk-based audits, 
under the o
versight of the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee therefore:
• deﬁnes the Internal Audit mandate and ensures no 
unjus
tiﬁed restrictions or limitations exist
• reviews the performance and effectiveness of the 
Int
ernal Audit function and its capacity to carry out 
the annual audit plan
• guarantees the independence of the Internal Audit 
function, thr
ough the functional reporting line and the 
direct unrestricted access
Internal Audit reviews aim to assess the effectiveness of 
the Gr
oup's governance and internal controls, and if they 
are properly designed to ensure safeguarding of assets, 
efficiency, economy and effectiveness of operations, 
adher
ence to applicable laws and regulations, reliability of 
ﬁnancial and operational reporting.
EXTERNAL AUDIT 
Ernst & Young Accountants LLP and Ernst & Young 
Inc
orporated were appointed as Group independent 
external auditors in 2022, for a period of three 
consecutive financial years, under the endorsement of 
the shar
eholders. The Group's audit rotation policy is to 
organise tenders for audit services regularly (every three 
years, maintaining some flexibility to adjust the timeline 
based on c
ontext), to ensure auditors' independence, as 
well as verify that audit fees are in line with the market.
The external auditors' scope of work include:
•review by EY South Africa of interim condensed 
C
onsolidated Financial Statements of the Group as at 
30 June
• audit by EY South Africa of the annual Consolidated 
Financial S
tatements of the Group and the 
standalone financial statements of the Company, 
prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), 
the SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued 
by the Accounting Practices Committee, Financial 
Pronouncements as issued by the Financial Reporting 
Standards Council, the JSE Listings Requirements
• audit by EY Netherlands of the annual Consolidated 
Financial S
tatements of the Group and the standalone 
financial statements of the Company, prepared in 
ac
cordance with IFRS as adopted by the European 
Union and with Title 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch 
Civil Code
• audit of the ﬁnancial statements of selected NEPI 
R
ockcastle entities, prepared in accordance with local 
accounting principles
The fees incurred for audit services are disclosed in 
the not
es to the ﬁnancial statements. No non-assurance 
services have been performed.
The Audit Committee and the external auditors have 
c
ommunicated on all matters required by Dutch Standard 
260/ International Standard on Auditing No. 260 
(Revised) 'Communication of audit matters with those in 
char
ge with governance'.
In addition, the external auditor has communicated that in 
r
espect of JSE Listings Requirements Paragraph 22.15(h):
• the audit ﬁrm has met all the criteria stipulated in the 
r
equirements, including that the audit regulator has 
completed a ﬁrm-wide independent quality control 
inspection of the audit ﬁrm "(Ernst & Young Inc.)" 
and on the designated individual auditor during its 
previous inspection cycle
• the auditors have provided to the Audit Committee 
the r
equired inspection decision letters, ﬁndings report 
and the proposed remedial action to address the 
ﬁndings at audit ﬁrm and individual auditor levels, 
and have conﬁrmed that there have been no legal or 
disciplinary proceedings brought against either of the 
two within the past 7 years
• the audit ﬁrm and the individual auditor understand 
their r
oles and have the competence, expertise, 
experience and skills required to discharge their 
speciﬁc audit and ﬁnancial reporting responsibilities
In accordance with best practice and the principle 
of dir
ect, independent communication between the 
Audit Committee and the external auditors, the Audit 
Committee was provided with the auditors' report 
including signiﬁcant auditing matters and observations 
related to the internal control environment and 
management's response. The Audit Committee reviewed 
the report and discussed the findings directly with 
the e
xternal auditor. The external auditors had private 
meetings with the Audit Committee, without the 
management team present and had unrestricted access to 
communicate privately to the Audit Committee any issue 
they may have considered necessary.
The external auditors conﬁrmed their independence to 
the A
udit Committee in respect of: relationships between 
Ernst & Young Accountants LLP, Ernst & Young Inc. and 
the Group; relationships and investments of individuals 
employed by Ernst & Young Accountants LLP and Ernst 
& Young Inc. in the Group; employment of Ernst & Young 
Accountants LLP and Ernst & Young Inc. staff by the 
Gr
oup; business relationships; other services provided by 
Ernst & Young Accountants LLP and Ernst & Young Inc. 
to the Group. The external auditors also conﬁrmed there 
has been no contingent fees, no services granted by 
Ernst & Young Accountants LLP and Ernst & Young Inc. 
to Directors and/or senior management of the Group 
and no gifts or hospitality. The auditors have additionally 
conﬁrmed compliance of the ﬁrm and individual audit 
partners with all internal Ernst & Young Accountants 
LLP and Ernst & Young Inc. independence requirements 
and rotation policies, as well as relevant regulatory 
and professional requirements, and have affirmed that 
their int
egrity, objectivity and independence have not 
been compromised.
The Audit Committee is satisﬁed with the information 
r
eceived based on which it concluded that Ernst & Young 
Accountants LLP and Ernst & Young Inc. and the audit 
partners in charge, are independent of the Group.

RISK MANAGEMENT AND 
C
OMPLIANCE OVERVIEW
The Group recognises the importance of enterprise 
risk management and c
onsiders risk in both the 
strategy-setting process and in driving and controlling 
performance. The Group further acknowledges that risk 
management is an increasingly important business driver 
and, together with compliance management, is embedded 
in all business processes, and is the responsibility of 
every employee.
Under the Group’s three lines of defence approach 
described in the C
orporate Governance section of 
this report, the Risk Management and Compliance 
functions share the second line of defence, a symbiosis 
supporting and strengthening the internal control 
system by capitalising on alignment and synergies. 
The Risk Management and Compliance functions are 
primarily charged with oversight of the risk and 
compliance management frameworks and processes, 
while encouraging risk owners to report relevant risk-
related information and monitor emerging risks. The Risk 
Management and Compliance functions work in synergy 
with risk owners when identifying and implementing new 
controls or mitigating threats, all facilitating effective 
risk management. Risk Management and Compliance 
partners (the “Risk P
artners”) have been assigned at 
the level of each business area, aiming to embed risk 
management and compliance in business processes, to 
promote risk management and compliance culture among 
Group personnel, as well as to facilitate collaboration with 
the Group’s Risk Management and Compliance Officer.
RISK MANAGEMENT AND 
C
OMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK
NEPI Rockcastle developed a comprehensive framework 
f
or the management of risks, to increase overall awareness 
among personnel and enable the management functions 
responsible for managing risks to better identify, assess 
and control risks within their areas. The framework:
• aligns and integrates risk management with strategy 
and busines
s objective setting
• creates a culture of risk management and periodically 
incr
eases awareness
• ensures all current and future material risk 
e
xposures are identified, assessed, quantified and 
appr
opriately managed
• enables compliance with relevant laws and regulations, 
wher
ever applicable, through the adoption of 
best practices
• enables financial stability and sustainable 
busines
s growth
• fosters an educated approach towards risks and 
pr
ovides a Group-level risk assessment methodology 
and tools
• integrates the best practice principles set forth 
under the C
ommittee of Sponsoring Organisations 
(COSO) framework and International Organisation for 
Standardisation (ISO) 31000
Group’s operations are subject to a wide variety of 
s
tatutory regulations and standards throughout different 
jurisdictions, so acting with integrity and observing the 
legal and ethical fr
ameworks are of utmost importance.
104 NEPI R ockcastle N.V.

Page 105:
An overarching compliance framework has been 
implement
ed, defining uniform rules and practices 
applicable to all Group entities which are therefore 
focused on conducting business activities lawfully and 
consistent with the Group's compliance obligations.
NEPI Rockcastle is committed to preventing and deterring 
risk
s associated to the following areas: 
• potential conflicts of interest
• related party transactions which may not be 
tr
ansparent or at arm’s length
• confidentiality and observance of professional secrecy
• unopen and incomplete financial reporting 
or communications
• non-compliance with fiscal regulations within a 
complex tax environment
• use of privileged information and insider trading
• money-laundering and the financing of terrorism
• inadequate adherence to anticorruption, anti-fraud 
and c
ompetition rules
• inefficient delegation of authority required to maintain 
the correct balance between flexibility, speed and span 
of control
The Group’s policies and procedures are periodically 
r
eviewed and revised to ensure permanent alignment 
to the applicable legal and regulatory framework as 
well as a practice to promote a continuously evolving 
business environment.
RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY AND 
RISK GO
VERNANCE
To ensure the efficient implementation of risk 
management principles and increase the overall risk-aware 
culture, the Group focuses its efforts on:
Increasing risk 
a
wareness and 
preventive conduct
Transparency and 
r
esponsibility in 
dealing with risk 
triggers
Aligning risk-aware 
b
ehaviours and 
decision-making with 
performance
Empowerment of 
Risk and
 Compliance 
Partners in promoting 
risk awareness
Embedding 
le
ssons learnt in 
risk management 
framework and 
business processes
Embedding risk in 
d
ecision-making, 
while enforcing 
accountability for risk 
undertaking
When implementing efficient and sound Risk Management 
practices, information is key, therefore the Group ensures 
it is shared and escalated within the business in 
a transparent manner. To support this, management 
provides the Risk Management and Compliance Officer, 
Risk Management and Compliance Committee (the 
C
ommittee) and Board of Directors with an appropriate 
level of relevant information, to assess whether current 
enterprise Risk Management practices are appropriate, 
facilitating their oversight.
Ensuring the Group’s Board of Directors provides 
o
versight of risk management, as well as embedding 
risk management in strategy and objectives setting, 
is of paramount importance. Risks are identified and 
mapped t
o one or more of the strategic goals. This 
mapping is revisited annually, once next year’s strategy 
has been set, to facilitate better risk assessment and early 
impact assessment.
The responsibility for managing risk is shared between 
management and the Boar
d of Directors assisted by 
the Committee. The Committee was established to 
support the Board in exercising oversight over enterprise 
Risk Management and Compliance processes, ensuring 
that the Group has implemented an effective approach 
tha
t will enhance its ability to achieve strategic and 
business objectives.

The risk management oversight role of the Board 
and of the C

knowledge. Board oversight (directly or through 
the Committee) covers scrutinising key management 
decisions, presenting alternative views, offering sound 
judgement, challenging or
ganisational biases, acting in 
cases of wrongdoing. The Board challenges management 
without assuming the operational role of management.
The detailed responsibilities and duties of the Board and 
C
ommittee are defined in their respective charters and 
the Group’s Corporate Governance Framework and are 
presented in the Corporate Governance section of this 
Annual Report, page 
76.
A Risk Management and Compliance Officer, reporting 
t

Directors with overseeing compliance and enterprise risk

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK
The Board ensures that Risk Management policies and 
pr
ocedures, as well as the Compliance Risk Framework, 
designed and implemented by the Risk Management 
and Compliance 
Officer with the endorsement of the 
C
ommittee, are:
1. consistent with the Group’s strategy and risk 
appetit
e; and
2. rely on an enterprise-wide culture that supports 
appr
opriate risk awareness, behaviours, and decisions.
The Board will also provide oversight over the 
implementa
tion of the General Compliance Policy, 
Code of Ethics, Whistleblowing Policy and overall Risk 
Management and Compliance system, based on regular 
reports provided by management, the Risk Management 
and Compliance 
Officer and Internal Audit Director.
Management embeds risk management practices into 
da
y-to-day operations and ensures that these practices 
are applied consistently, seeking to (i) build a risk-
aware culture, (ii) agree risk management performance 
targets, (iii) ensure implementation of risk management 
recommendations and (iv) identify and report incidents, 
changed circumstances or emerging risks. Based on the 
risk appetite approved by the Board, management also 
decides whether to proceed with mitigation strategies and 
implement contingencies, while the Board directly, and 
through the Committee, exercises oversight.
Risk and Compliance Partners
 have been assigned to 
each area of expertise within the Group, to support the 
Risk Management and Compliance Officer in identifying 
and addr
essing risk triggers. The Risk Partners act 
as risk ambassadors throughout the Group, being 
the front office for risk triggers identification. They 
shar
e their knowledge and expertise, supporting the 
Risk Management and Compliance Officer in assessing 
the impact and pr
obability of risk triggers, as well 
as recommending appropriate mitigation measures to 
address them.
Every employee has a responsibility to:
1. understand and implement Risk 
Management pr
ocesses
2. report inefficient, unnecessary or unworkable Risk 
Management measures
3. report loss events and near-miss incidents; and
4. cooperate with management on incident investigation
As the Group operates in multiple jurisdictions and 
has a c
omplex structure comprising a holding and 
financing entity, operational and management company 
subsidiaries, the Risk Management and Compliance 
Officer, in consultation with both management and 
the Committee has defined a structure of roles and 
responsibilities at management level, to ensure an 
effective framework for managing risks for each entity 
and local jurisdictions it oper
ates in.
In consideration of its power to challenge management on 
the Risk Management s
ystem and based on the reports 
it receives directly and/or through the Committee, the 
Board may decide to request independent assurance on 
the effectiveness of Risk Management processes from 
e
xternal parties (consultants, auditors etc.).
Risk management effectiveness is supported by 
fr
amework design, operation, monitoring and reporting. 
Appropriate measures have been implemented so that to 
ensure such effectiveness:
• the risks associated with the strategy and activities of 
the Gr
oup have been identified and assessed, covering 
s
trategic, operational, compliance and reporting risks
• the risk appetite has been defined and needed 
measur
es in order to mitigate risks have 
been implemented
• the risk and compliance management function, as well 
as the o
verall internal controls system are in place 
and effectively operating, while neither significant 
changes nor major failings occurred during the past 
financial year
• the material changes in external factors and their 
impact on the Gr
oup’s activities have been considered, 
assessed and monitored, while tailored action 
plans have been defined with the support of the 
management, periodically monit
ored and reported
• the Risk Management and Compliance Officer 
reports quarterly to the Committee on the evolution 
of monit
ored risks and provides a highlight of 
emerging ones. The Risk Management and Compliance 
Officer
 also reports on the overall performance 
of the Risk Management and Compliance function 
and may raise any significant trigger risking to

impact Group operations and/or the overall internal 
c
ontrol environment
The Group confirms that:
1. this report provides sufficient insights (including if 
ther
e would have been any failings in the effectiveness 
of the internal risk management and control systems 
with r
egard to internal and external risks), as well 
as material shortcomings that have been identified 
and material risks which the company may face, i.e., 
s
trategic, operational, compliance and reporting risks, 
in the consideration of approved risk appetite limits;
2. the most relevant risk triggers the Group encountered 
in 20
23, were all in line with approved Group 
risk appetite limits, associated business impact and 
mitigating actions. The occurrence and criticality of 
these risks were reassessed quarterly and reported to 
the Risk and Compliance Committee;
3. the internal risk management and control systems 
pr
ovide reasonable assurance that the financial 
reporting does not contain any material inaccuracies. 
NEPI R
ockcastle implemented adequate internal 
controls and review processes, such as a financial 
reporting calendar and routines, checks and balances 
in the r
eporting process, monthly reconciliation 
and budget versus actual review, quarterly review 
of the financial statements and results by the 
A
udit Committee.
4. this report includes the material risks, respectively 
s
trategic, operational, compliance and reporting risks, 
as well as the uncertainties, to the extent that 
they are relevant to the expectation of the Group’s 
continuity for the period of twelve months after the 
preparation of the report, whereas the overall net 
risk levels, calculated based on Group’s approved 
risk management methodology, are in line with the 
approved risk appetite limits and consistent with 
Group’s strategic objectives; and
5. considering current position of the Group, it is 
appr
opriate to prepare its financial statements on a 
going c
oncern basis. Having considered the potential 
impact of the geo-political conflictual context and 
the o
verall macroeconomic environment on the 
Company’s and the wider NEPI Rockcastle Group 
revenues, 
profits, cash flows, operations, liquidity 
position and debt, management concluded that 
despite the disruptive market events that continued 
to favour such circumstances during 2023 and 
subsequent to the year-end, as well as in the 
consideration of the above mentioned risk categories 
and approved Group risk appetite, there are no 
material uncertainties relating to the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
No major failings in the internal controls system or risk 
management appr
oach were identified by management 
in 20
23.

RISK APPETITE
NEPI Rockcastle closely monitors risks with a potential 
impact on s
trategic goals, assessed in accordance with 
the risk evaluation methodology. The Group considers in 
its periodic assessment risk triggers such as fluctuations 
in the Group’s financial results, changes in political, social, 
legal, regulatory or economic conditions, inflation, interest 
r
ates, fluctuation in exchange rates, deflation, the Group’s 
ability t
o successfully implement business strategies, 
future investments and acquisitions, competition.
The Group has developed and approved criteria defining 
its risk appetite regarding critical activities creating, 
pr
eserving and realising value. Such critical activities, 
processes and topics include asset management, 
leasing, investments, tax structure management, treasury 
operations, tenant relationship, data privacy, human 
resources, Know-Your-Partner process.
The Group has set the following financing related targets 
t
o ensure risks are managed properly:
• a weighted average debt maturity of at least three 
y
ears at any given time
• at least 70% of property portfolio should be 
unenc
umbered; and
• LTV ratio below 35% (maximum 40% in the short-
t
erm)
NEPI Rockcastle has zero tolerance towards risks 
r
elated to:
• health and safety (for example structural integrity of 
pr
operties, fire security, serious pollution)
• fraud and corruption
• doing business with clients/partners not carrying out 
legal and legitima
te activities or rejecting transparency
• money laundering and terrorism financing
• serious violation of the Code of Ethics by employees, 
c
ollaborators or Directors
• damage to reputation materially affecting its ability 
t
o attract funding, personnel or relationships with 
business partners
• non-compliance with material regulatory requirements 
(f
or example competition, data privacy)
• exposing the Group and its employees, collaborators 
or Dir
ectors to any criminal liability
• non-compliance with financial reporting standards
• any practices presenting a risk of market abuse 
as defined by the rules and regulations of the 
markets where the Group's debt or equity instruments 
are trading
The Group 
defines its risk appetite for each material area 
as follows:
Data Privacy. The Group has zero tolerance towards 
(i) material regulatory non-compliance, significantly 
affecting data subjects’ rights and liberties; (ii) intrusive, 
disproportionate or unlawful data processing; (iii) 
personnel misconduct leading to material reputational 
and/or 
financial consequences for the Group.
Taxation. The Group has a low risk tolerance to matters 
which ma
y trigger in the future a risk of interpretation by 
the tax authorities as being non-compliant with applicable 
laws. In this respect, the Group (i) is continuously 
monitoring the tax legislative developments as well as 
the European Court of Justice cases on the abuse of 
EU law, (ii) has a prudent approach on its tax structure 
and ensures that the Group companies are economically 
embedded within the structure and are equipped with 
sufficient
 functions and activities.
Treasury operations. The Group has a very limited 
appetit
e towards investments in listed securities and any 
actions in respect of listed securities portfolio are taken 
based on the decision of Investment Committee.
Acquisitions.
 The Group does not invest in properties that 
do not fulfil cumulatively specific pre-set criteria, such 
as c
ountry risk, positioning, demographics, GLA, quality, 
profile of tenants etc.
Construction works. The Group has (i) zero tolerance 
t
o any risk that would compromise safety on the 
construction site and later on during the exploitation of 
the property; (ii) zero tolerance to using construction 
materials, installations and equipment that are not fully 
compliant with applicable laws and regulations and/or 
that dangerous for the workers, staff or visitors; (iii) 
v
ery limited tolerance towards making savings in the 
development budget if by doing so it creates a risk 
of compromising the quality of the property, while 
at all times and in any circumstances the safety of 
property and people should not be at risk; (iv) zero 
tolerance to starting development works based on non-
compliant or incomplete planning or permitting approvals 
to works that require additional costs in absence of 
appropriate approvals.
Tenants.
 The Group has a low appetite towards (i) making 
compromises to the overall tenants mix quality, accepted 
only on a short-term basis and in exceptional situations, 
determined by the social-economic environment, usually 
triggered by emergency episodes (such as pandemic, 
calamities etc.) or local/regional particular context; (ii) 
tenants with a track record of not paying their debts; 
(iii) accepting tenants that cannot provide adequate 
creditworthiness documentation. To this end, detailed 
creditworthiness reviews are performed before signing 
lease agreements and all tenants are required to provide 
guarantees, covering rent and operating costs, based 
on exposure.
Political environment. The Group has (i) a low appetite 
t
owards extending its portfolio in jurisdictions that 
could determine uncertainty and/or delays in executing 
the Group’s strategy; (ii) zero tolerance towards any 
request or initiative of financial support (sponsorship, 
donation, any other in-kind benefits etc.) to any political 
party and/
or politically exposed person, as well as to 
involvement in political issues of the countries where it 
is present.

IT infrastructure. The Group does not accept (i) operating 
without having a backup of the Company data material 
for the operation of its business and disaster recovery 
of critical IT infrastructure; (ii) risks that would materially 
impair the reliability of the Group’s IT infrastructure; 
(iii) operating without having in place measures and 
processes designed to prevent/pro-actively preventing 
any form of cyber-attacks such as spam, phishing, 
malware, ransomware campaigns.
Management of the Group’s assets.
 The Group (i) 
does not accept impairing the state and condition 
of its properties for the sake of short-term income 
increase or cost savings; (ii) has a very low appetite 
towards compromising the long-term prospects and the 
sustainability of the property for short-terms gains; (iii) 
accepts the risk of failure in respect of innovative 
initiatives such as PropTech, retail transformation, etc. as 
long as the financial impact is within budget and there 
is no other ma
terial impact such as on reputation, non-
compliance or health and safety.
Know-your-client/partner. The Group's policy is to work 
only with clients/
partners who carry out legal and 
legitimate activities and maintain business transparency. 
The know-your-partner/client process focuses on the 
assessment of the identity of clients/partners, as well as 
of their potential involvement in acts of corruption, fraud, 
terrorism financing,
 money laundering. The Group’s risk 
assessment methodology is supported by a risk-based 
approach, which involves the use of evidence-based 
decision-making to target the risks of money laundering 
and terrorism 
financing.
The end-to-end Know Your Customer/Partner Process 
has been aut
omated, based on the eligibility criteria and 
risk matrix as defined in the Group Know Your Client/
Partner Procedure.
Competition. According to the Risk Appetite Statement, 
the Gr
oup has zero-tolerance towards risks related to 
non-compliance with material regulatory requirements 
concerning competition. Therefore, the Group is 
committed to high standards of ethical, moral and legal 
business conduct, as well as to observing antitrust laws 
promoting free and open competition in the marketplace. 
Anticompetitive practices are, as a rule, prohibited. An 
anticompetitive practice is a conduct which severely 
prevents, restricts, distorts or otherwise 
affects the 
competition on the market.
The Group deploys periodical training and awareness 
campaigns, ther
efore a dedicated competition compliance 
program has been implemented at Group level to 
help collaborators and employees identify such sensitive 
aspects of their current activity. The competition 
compliance training sessions focused on general 
legal requirements in competition area, accepted 
and unaccepted competitive practices, examples of 
behaviours that might occur in the daily activities, 
rules to be observed during potential competition 
authorities’ investigations.
Also, as part of Group’s ongoing efforts
 (i) to enable a 
unitary approach and common practices at Group level, 
(ii) to obtain the comfort that tenders follow an ethical, 
anti-money laundry, anti-corruption and anti-collusion 
wise process, as well as (iii) to ensure a fair competition 
between the participants to the tender process and to 
keep Group entities safe from litigation risk, sanction 
and/or reputational risks and 
financial losses, a standard 
t
ender process and specific documentation have been 
implemented and are reviewed periodically.
During normal course of business, all employees/
c
ollaborators of the Group have the obligation and the 
responsibility to ensure that their actions do not infringe 
competition compliance rules and requirements.

When determining the risk appetite for a particular risk 
tha
t does not fall into the zero-tolerance category, the 
capacity of the Group to absorb the risk in the pursuit of 
its strategy and business objectives shall be considered, 
as well as the Group’s tolerance. The tolerance represents 
the acceptable variation in performance in relation to 
the targets, as they are defined by the Group strategy 
and further on cascaded based on specific performance 
indica
tors per area of activity and per individuals.
Exceptions to risk appetite are extremely rare and always 
f
ollow the escalation process, while risk undertaking is 
transparently embedded in the decision-making process.
RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS 
AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Before implementing adequate mitigation measures, it is 
crucial t
o assess the probability and impact of each risk in 
relation to the cost of mitigation. Additionally, the Group’s 
risk appetite plays a significant role in decision-making.
For significant risks, a contingency plan is essential. This 
plan outlines a series of activities that should be executed 
either before the event occurs or when it happens. These 
plans serve two critical purposes:
• Mitigation: Contingency plans help manage risks by 
pr
oviding a structured approach to addressing them. 
They outline specific actions to minimise the impact of 
adverse events
• Monitoring and Evaluation: Properly executed 
c
ontingency plans allow for ongoing monitoring of risk 
treatment progress. They also facilitate the evaluation 
of residual risk, ensuring that any remaining risk is 
within acceptable limits

Risk awareness is essential for all employees. It involves 
unders
tanding what constitutes a threat and being 
attuned to specific events or factors that could potentially 
impact the Group. This heightened awareness enables 
effective risk identification.
Management plays a critical role in this process. They 
identify and metic
ulously document key assessed risks in 
a Risk Register. Additionally, any emerging risk factors or 
e
vents are promptly brought to the attention of the Risk 
Management and Compliance Officer, the Committee and 
the Boar
d, where appropriate.
In the process of identifying, assessing, responding to and 
r
eporting on risks, the Group uses dedicated tools:
Risk Register
a
n automated and 
auditable inventory 
that lists the risks 
identiﬁed as relevant 
and that may impact 
the achievement 
of strategy and 
business objectives, 
subject to revision 
on a quarterly 
basis with the 
support and active 
involvement of Risk 
and Compliance 
Partners.

a crisis
• concrete and detailed split of responsibility 
among s
takeholders
Personnel is aware of what constitutes a threat and 
is sensitiv
e to specific events or factors that could 
pot
entially impact the Group. Risk identification consists 
of det
ermining which threats are likely to affect the 
Gr
oup, therefore risks are documented and monitored 
through the Risk Register, and reported quarterly to 
the Committee.
Employees are trained to report incidents of malfunction, 
suspicious activities, thr
eats or weaknesses potentially 
affecting health and safety, information security, physical 
security, information systems continuity, privacy or other 
relevant areas. If a crisis occurs, the crisis management 
team will respond according to the Incident and Crisis 
Management Policy, following key principles such as:
• place the highest priority on people safety: employees, 
clients, visit
ors, partners, emergency responders and 
community members, as best practice proves that 
personnel are more likely to co-operate with the extra 
demands during a disruptive incident, if their welfare 
needs are met
• ensure the integrity and safety of property goods and 
t
enants’ products for sale
• protect assets and ensure continuity of 
busines
s processes
• maintain a strong brand reputation
• make decisions and take actions that are consistent 
with the Gr
oup’s core values
• comply with all applicable national and international 
la
ws, rules and regulations
• make public disclosures that are full, fair, accurate, 
timely and unders
tandable, regarding the impact of 
the crisis on Group’s facilities, associates, customers, 
operations and communities
• consider all stakeholders and share relevant 
inf
ormation with them, in a timely manner         
Senior management is responsible for the design and 
implementa
tion of effective crisis management strategy, 
plans, processes and organisation. The Group sets up a 
Crisis Management Team (CMT), to manage major events 
and those categorised as crisis. The composition of the 
CMT and response depend on the scope, nature and 
(potential) impact. The CMT is authorised to mobilise all 
internal and external resources that it deems necessary 
to manage a crisis. External resources include, but 
are not limited to, law firms, technicians, consultants, 
public r
elations companies, third-party logistics, employee 
assistance providers, etc.
The CMT is accountable for the Group’s response 
t
o a crisis and for addressing the concerns of staff 
and key stakeholders, for example NEPI Rockcastle's 
leadership
, investors, key customers, suppliers and 
government officials.

COMPLIANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT 
IN 20
23
Key activities performed to enhance compliance and 
risk management
During 2023, the Group conducted a periodic internal 
r
eview of the enterprise Risk Management and 
Compliance Management system. As part of this 
review, the Risk Management and Compliance Framework 
underwent amendments to ensure a tailored approach to 
risk assessment and mitigation.
These amendments and overall efforts focused on the 
r
eview and enhancement of the operation of the internal 
risk management and control systems, particularly on the 
following directions:
• testing business continuity arrangements 
and r
eviewing the incident and crisis 
management framework
• training and awareness programmes for all staff, 
focusing mainly on prevention of corruption, gifts 
polic
y, whistleblowing rules and channels, competition 
law requirements, business continuity essentials and 
conduct rules
• induction training handbook for new joiners revised to 
ac
commodate business continuity related topics and 
rules on incidents and crisis identification and handling
• definition of specific controls and segregation of 
duties rules to be embedded in business processes 
and supporting technology (e.g., optimised leasing 
process, redesigned Group procurement processes)
• improving the Group Know your Client/Partner 
Pr
ocess and assessment tools, in order to optimise 
data quality and improve monitoring processes
• increasing efficiency of the partnership between 
Risk Management, C
ompliance Officer and Risk 
Partners in order to optimise risk triggers collection 
and mitigation
• embedding compliance and risk management in key 
Gr
oup projects, especially in the digital transformation 
and process automation initiatives
• ensuring a more efficient and transparent sponsorship 
and donation process
• optimise gift vouchers handling process, embedding 
adequa
te controls, clear responsibilities split and 
monitoring framework
The Group business impact assessment methodology and 
the business continuity arrangements followed the usual 
annual review process.
The analysis covered all processes and subprocess, 
especially ne
w ones, interdependencies between areas 
and departments, resources, people, assets and suppliers’ 
availability, critical systems and flows. Processes and 
subpr
ocesses are aligned to top risks, while hypothetical 
disruptions in critical processes are assessed based on a 
risk matrix, designed to consider the potential financial 
impact, as well as the impact on partners, operations, 
legal/
regulatory obligations and reputation exposure of 
the Group.
A dedicated training and awareness program has been 
de
veloped for senior management, Risk & Compliance 
partners and all staff, aiming to increase crisis risk 
culture, responsiveness and adaptability to incidents and 
crisis management.
Monitoring the 
effectiveness of risk management and 
internal controls system
As part of its ongoing monitoring and enhancement 
efforts
 in the area of internal risk management operation 
and internal controls efficiency, the Group focused in 2023 
on the de
velopment of:
• the internal regulatory framework
• optimisation and digitalisation of business and support 
pr
ocesses, while embedding adequate controls
• testing of its business continuity arrangements
• training and awareness programs
• intensifying collaboration with risk and 
c
ompliance partners
• interaction of the 2nd and 3rd levels of internal 
c
ontrol system
Following a Group-wide fraud and criminal corporate 
liability risk as
sessment, the Risk Management and 
Compliance Officer monitored closely the status of action 
plans and r
eported the progress to the Committee on a 
quarterly basis. The assessment is performed and updated 
at least annually, based on most relevant fraud risk 
scenarios and a risk-based approach, where probability 
and impact are assessed both as gross and net values, i.e., 
before and after mitigation.

Following such assessment, the Company derives the 
priorities f
or the following year in terms of key risk areas 
and expected mitigation effort. General measures, such as 
increased awareness and training, policy development and 
periodic updates, revision of job descriptions are derived 
and prioritised.
The Risk Management and Compliance 
Officer sets 
gener
al priorities and key focus areas for the following 
year, which are included in the Compliance Program, and 
progress is reported quarterly to the Committee.
The risk management and compliance key priority areas 
f
or 2023 are detailed below:
BUSINESS CONDUCT  
(INTRA-GROUP AND IN RELATION 
TO EXTERNAL PARTNERS)
OPERATIONS AND PROCESSES CONTEXTUAL RISK RESPONSE PLAN
• Unethical conduct
•

• Information security
• Data Storage
• Transfer Pricing
• Data privacy 
• Procurement process

• Leasing process 
• Business continuity
• Regional conﬂictual contexts
• Energy crisis
• Crisis communication 
management
In addition to ad-hoc meetings that are held whenever 
needed t
o consider special matters, to enhance the 
effectiveness of the risk management process, the Risk 
and Compliance Committee is convening on a quarterly 
basis. An
y incidents and matters which are relevant in 
determining the level of the effectiveness of the Group’s 
risk management ar
e raised by management, through the 
Risk and Compliance Officer, to the Committee. Ultimately, 
the Internal Audit function, as the third line of defence 
in the internal controls system, assesses the effectiveness 
of risk management carried out by the first two lines 
of def
ence, i.e., compliance and risk management and 
business management.
Any significant incidents, misalignments between the 
decision, actions and activities of the Group and its 
risk appetite or ineffective processes or controls were 
addressed through appropriate measures, such as revision 
of existing or implementation of additional policies 
or procedures.
Training and awareness programs
 have been organised 
for new joiners and all staff during 2023, supporting 
implementation of the new policies and procedures, 
reminding of Compliance and Risk Management 
essentials, aiming to raise risk awareness and developing 
a proactive risk aware culture among Group personnel. 
Regular posts on internal communication platform 
covered ethical conduct, gifts policy, whistleblowing 
values and available channels, and encouraged the 
Company's tone at the top and speak-up culture. 
Awareness campaigns on ethics and anti-corruption 
practices were organised to cover also Group partners, 
clients and suppliers.
To ensure transparent communication is part of an 
efficient
 Risk Management process, regular alignment 
workshops continued in 2023 between functions 
responsible for the second line of defence (Risk 
Management and Compliance) and the third line of 
defence (Internal Audit), promoting an aligned Group-
wide approach to preventing risk exposure and increasing 
the efficiency of overall Risk Management practices. To 
ensur
e that strategy and business goals were considered 
when setting and adjusting the Risk Management 
system, as well as to enhance the tone at the top 
culture, periodical consultations focusing on projects 
and initia
tives, process optimisation, potential risks 
and mitigation factors, especially in the context of a 
changeable socio-economic environment requiring fast 
strategic decisions and an adaptable risk management 
approach, continued, between the Risk Management 
and Compliance 
Officer, Chief Executive Officer, Chief 
Financial Officer, Internal Audit Director and Group 
L
egal Counsel, all permanent guests in the Risk & 
Compliance Committee.
The Business Continuity Plan has been successfully tested 
in 2023, followed by the regular awareness training 
for Group personnel, as well as dedicated awareness 
workshops for senior management members and Risk & 
Compliance partners. Awareness and training, tone from 
the top promoting a risk culture, timely communication, 
remain key success factors for an efficient business 
c
ontinuity system management, especially in the current 
political and economic context. Learning from recent 
crisis episodes (e.g., pandemics, regional conflicts, energy 
crisis
) where timely reaction proved to be crucial, 
the Group continued to closely monitor the overall 
geo-political and economic landscape, while preserving 
business continuity and agility to react where immediate 
action is needed. Throughout the difficult
 and complex 
context that extended to 2023, the Group’s focus has 
always been to preserve people safety, assets protection, 
processes continuity, functional partnerships with tenants 
and suppliers, successful and transparent internal and 
external communication.
The Group corporate governance framework has been 
r
eviewed and adjusted to align to the evolving and 
demanding legal and regulatory environment, as well as

to support the dynamic of internal business optimisation 
pr
ojects and initiatives.
Risk management, Compliance and Internal Audit are 
in
volved in Group optimisation and digital transformation 
projects so that they may recommend the most efficient 
control approach. Furthermore, Compliance validates 
all policies and pr
ocedures, and ensures coordination 
of the internal methodological process, enabling it to 
recommend needed controls and raise potential concerns 
in a timely manner.
The Risk Management and Compliance 
Officer ensures 
all policies and pr
ocedures are available to all employees 
on Group’s intranet and are regularly consulted. 
Relevant changes are shared by the means of internal 
communication channels, so that all Group existing 
personnel as well as new joiners may easily become 
familiar with the internal regulatory framework updates. 
The Risk Management and Compliance 
Officer offers 
guidance and advice to all staff regarding their roles 
and responsibilities.
Management assesses the risks of material misstatements 
in the financial statements due to fraud, by continuous 
e
valuation of the design and relevant aspects of the 
system of internal controls, as well as among others the 
code of ethics and whistleblowing procedure. Mitigation 
of the risk of material misstatements in the financial 
statements is achieved through:
• Implementation of a financial reporting calendar, as 
w
ell as relevant internal controls, routines, checks and 
balances in the reporting process
• Ensuring an appropriately sised and experienced 
finance and reporting team
• Reconciling on a monthly basis, budget and forecast 
numbers t
o actuals, with quarterly review performed 
by the Audit Committee
• Audit Committee’s review of significant management 
estimates and accounting policies
• Development of a single integrated, secure and 
perf
ormant IT architecture for ERP, Budget and 
Forecasting, Leasing, Procure-to-Pay, Master Data 
Management and Group Financial and Operational 
Reporting, delivering digital capability for end-to-end 
business management
• Periodic internal and external auditors’ review
The Group implemented a comprehensive Procurement 
P
olicy and a supplier due diligence process, to ensure 
that responsible purchasing is conducted and that 
procurement decisions are in the best interest of the 
Company. Responsible purchasing is aimed at Group 
level through:
• implementation of sound policies, promoting 
objectivity and tr
ansparency throughout the 
procurement processes and monitoring of 
compliance thereto
• implementation of aligned requirements and controls 
in pr
operty management/project management 
contracts, to ensure that the same principles are 
applied by outsourced property and project managers
• design of a detailed supplier risk assessment and due 
diligenc
e, including suppliers green assessment
• win-win partnerships with some Group suppliers, 
based on sus
tainable business practices, where the 
Group and its suppliers may thrive and grow
The Group rolled out a Leasing Policy, to ensure that 
t
enant relationships are managed with professionalism 
and at high standards across the Group, and that internal 
controls are implemented, fostering transparency and 
enabling the achievement of the Company’s objectives. 
A risk assessment and due diligence process are applied 
when onboarding new tenants and periodical revisions are 
performed thereafter.
The Board is responsible for the governance and ongoing 
o
versight of internal controls, including information 
and technology. The Board conﬁrms that processes 
exist ensuring timely, relevant, accurate and accessible 
reporting, communication and data storage. To this end, 
the Board ensures that the Group’s IT processes and 
systems are integrated with the overall business strategy 
and objectives, monitoring that:
• processes, people and information technology are 
int
egrated seamlessly across the Group
• hard and soft infrastructure supports the achievement 
of the Gr
oup’s strategy
• proper arrangements are implemented for business 
c
ontinuity and disaster recovery
• proper security measures have been implemented 
t
o ensure that conﬁdential data is safeguarded and 
easily accessible, while complying with the relevant 
cybersecurity, data protection or other applicable laws 
and regulations
• proper investments in information technology are 
made with a vie
w to enable the above
The Board has delegated the responsibility for IT and 
sec
urity to the CEO through the Operational Mandate 
and the CEO has further cascaded these to the Group 
Technology Director. Where IT processes are outsourced 
to third-party service providers, these are governed by 
service level agreements, with compliance monitored 
by management.
Appropriate IT security and business continuity 
management policies ha
ve been developed and 
implemented across the Group.
NEPI Rockcastle demonstrates a strong commitment 
t
o cybersecurity. By implementing extensive measures, 
they aim to safeguard against material data breaches, 
information leakage, and the loss of critical data.
The Group continued in 2023 its cybersecurity 
pr
ogramme, focused on awareness, prevention (through 
regular training programs for all employees at least on 
an annual basis) and security by design. The Group 
implemented and communicated a clear escalation 
mechanism where any suspected attack can be reported 
and analysed. The 2023 awareness and prevention 
program focused on training programs for all employees 
meant to raise awareness of emerging security threats, 
key vulnerabilities, Company’s policies, procedures and 
support functions. The Group was the target of 
cybersecurity attacks during the year, while none 
had serious consequences due to the safeguards

implemented. No attack led to either a signiﬁcant 
leak
age, loss of personal data and business secrets, or to 
unavailability of technology and business interruptions in 
the three years preceding this report date.
With a focus to enhance internal controls, increase 
efficiency, transparency and traceability, and to operate 
in a paperles
s environment (to the extent possible and 
within current legal constraints in various jurisdictions), 
the Group has been working on digitalisation and process 
automation tools across various areas and processes, as a 
medium-term strategic priority.
The Group implemented and periodically reviews the 
Gener
al Compliance Policy aiming to guide compliance 
by: (i) setting a clear compliance framework; (ii) 
promoting consistent, rigorous and comprehensive 
practices throughout the Group; and (iii) stimulating a 
culture of compliance, including ethics and integrity.
The Compliance function covers the following 
r
esponsibilities at Group level:
• advisory: counsels all management levels and 
personnel on c
ompliance with laws, rules and 
standards, including keeping them informed on 
legislative developments and emerging exposure
• education: assists senior management in educating 
staff
 on compliance issues
• identiﬁcation, measurement and assessment of 
c
ompliance risks: evaluates the compliance risks 
associated with business activities, including the 
development of new business practices and 
new partnerships
• monitoring, testing and reporting: periodically 
as
sesses compliance and monitors risks in all 
jurisdictions and emerging legislation
The Board and the Committee monitored the compliance 
management s
ystem structured on three pillars: (i) 
build awareness and enable prevention; (ii) deploy 
sufficient detection and investigation mechanisms; and 
(iii) implement appropriate response, mitigation and 
consequence management.

operational processes at Group level, seeking to 
prevent Group exposure to excessive risks;
7. set the annual Compliance Programme and report 
periodically t
o the Risk and Compliance Committee, 
on the risk and compliance management status;
8. advise about the impact of legal and regulatory 
changes, as w
ell the best practices and 
legislative trends;
9. ensure deployment of training and awareness 
pr

10. perform periodical compliance checks seeking to 
ensur
e that the implemented processes are aligned 
to the internal and legal framework, as well as that 
the appropriate controls are in place in order to 
prevent compliance risk to materialise.
NEPI Rockcastle implemented privacy policies and 
pr
ocedures across the Group, based on a zero tolerance to 
major information loss or leakage, and these are deployed 
and monitored by an experienced Data Protection 
Officer. 
The Group's approach to privacy includes:
• embedding privacy-by-design principle in 
c
ore processes
• embedding data privacy clauses in supplier and 
c
ustomer contracts
• providing clear and relevant information to all data 
subjects r
egarding their rights and the coordination 
of processing;
• making sure that data is processed only for the 
purpose it has been c
ollected
• following the data minimisation principle, as well as 
the applicable da
ta retention periods
• properly protecting personal data from loss or 
unauthorised ac
cess
No breach resulting in a major leakage, loss or 
una
vailability of personal data occurred in 2023.
The Group's policies and procedures are available to all 
emplo
yees in a shared location, promoted on internal 
communication channels and periodically acknowledged 
by the Group personnel. Training and awareness 
programmes are regularly organised, at least on an annual 
basis, as further described in the Risk and Compliance 
section of this annual report, page 
104.
Operational compliance is monitored for all companies 
in the Gr
oup and reported to the Risk and Compliance 
Committee on a quarterly basis. The Group would 
disclose in the Annual Report if it were to incur 
material or repeated regulatory penalties, sanctions or 
ﬁnes for breaches of, or non-compliance with, statutory 
obligations. At the date of this report, there were no 
material regulatory penalties, sanctions or ﬁnes for breach 
or non-compliance with statutory obligations imposed on 
Group companies or any of its Directors or 
officers.
Considering that the Group operates in many countries, 
thr
ough its activities or commercial campaigns and 
projects it carries out, and in line with the intention to 
bring more transparency to business processes and clarity 
on the responsibility split, the sponsorship & donations 
process has been formalised in a policy and needed 
controls adequately embedded. An important aspect of 
Group’s commitment to responsible corporate behaviour 
is to exercise social responsibility through donations and 
sponsorships wherever it operates. The Group aims to 
ensure any donation, sponsorship and related funding 
fully comply with applicable laws, its business ethics 
principles, as stated in its Code of Ethics, and cannot 
be perceived by a third party to be for the purpose 
of corruption.
Sponsorships and donations are part of the Group 
C
orporate and Social Responsibility strategy, and more 
details are included in pillar 2 of the Sustainability Report, 
page 150.
In order to efficiently manage operational risk, fraud risk 
and financial losses, NEPI Rockcastle assesses periodically 
the way existing and optimised activities, processes 
and flows are documented and relevant controls are 
embedded therein. Where the need, process steps, rules 
and responsibilities are mapped and documented in detail 
in dedicated internal policies and procedures which are 
further on implemented and supported by training and 
awareness campaigns in focus groups.
PLANNED AREAS OF FUTURE FOCUS
Annually, the Risk Management and Compliance 
Officer 
performs a risk assessment, to determine the focus areas 
f
or the following year and whether there is a need 
to update the Group internal regulatory framework and 
refine the Annual Compliance Program.
Considering the instability of the general geo-political 
landscape
, the reasonable concerns regarding inflation 
ratio and price increase in services and goods sectors, as 
w
ell as overall unpredictability in most essential areas of 
interest, the Group decides to concentrate in 2024 on the 
following key areas:
• increase knowledge and awareness of the 
risk management c
ulture and particularly crisis 
management culture
• embed business continuity in all core processes, as 
w
ell as take a “by design” approach in all projects 
and initiatives
• avoid unethical practices and encourage partners to

and digital tr
ansformation
• ensure adequate segregation of responsibilities 
and c

revised processes
• increase awareness of money laundering and terrorism 
financing triggers
Embedding risk management in strategy and business 
objectiv
es setting as well as in the execution process, 
is key to successful and effective enterprise risk 
management, so this goal r
emains a top priority for the 
Group. As such, the digitalisation and automation of core 
processes, accommodating internal controls, segregated 
roles and action rules, as well as documentation of 
relevant processes and 
flows in internal policies and 
procedures will remain a priority in 2024.
Data governance continues to be a priority also in 
20
24, aiming to improve the overall data management: 
ownership responsibilities, storage and archiving rules, 
adequate labelling and access controls embedded 
in business processes, monitoring and continuous 
improvement, partnership with specialised companies 
in physical storage management in order to safeguard 
integrity, security and confidentiality of data and 
inf
ormation. Such implementation, requiring significant 
financial and human resources, aims to prevent risk 
e
xposure of the Group entities to financial and 
r
eputational loss, and to protect the assets of the Group 
and of its partners.
Information technology and cybersecurity have continued 
t
o undergo material mitigation in 2023, managing 
to address efficiently and significantly most relevant 
c
oncerns and vulnerabilities. Proper controls and 
validations have been embedded in the business process 
to enable centralised decision making for IT software and 
hardware projects, appoint a dedicated legal partner for 
IT-related contractual arrangements and enable extended 
risk assessment of outsourced services as well as used 
software and systems. This area will remain a focus in 
2024, especially (i) the redesign of shopping centres’ 
network infrastructure, given the associated risk exposure 
to financial and reputational losses triggered by potential 
incidents, da
ta breaches, impact on Group confidential 
information and individuals’ data, (ii) the implementation 
of additional t
ools and features meant to harden existing 
security defensive environment, as well as (iii) the training 
an awareness programs intended to increase knowledge 
and develop detection skills for Group personnel enabling 
easy identification of unusual conduct targeting to 
compromise data and information security or integrity.
Increasing risk awareness and encouraging a more 
pr
oactive instead of reactive risk management culture 
among Group personnel will remain of utmost importance 
and will be included on the agenda of the Risk 
Management and Compliance 
Officer, the Committee, 
and the management team for the next years, as a 
critical success factor in achieving Group’s strategic and 
business objectives. Also, crisis management culture is 
of particular interest, and employees will be trained to 
react appropriately when facing a crisis, as this might 
not only save lives but also increase the efficiency of 
r
emedial actions.
Training and awareness programmes remain a focus. 
Onboar
ding and annual campaigns are organised for all 
staff and Directors. Regular awareness campaigns will 
continue for staff and third-party partners (suppliers 
and tenants), encouraging them to express legitimate 
concerns regarding how NEPI Rockcastle’s personnel 
perform their duties and approach them.
KEY RISK AREAS
Unexpected significant developments in the political, 
economic, ﬁnancial, regulatory, geopolitical, social or 
health environments in the jurisdictions the Group 
operates, may have an impact on Group’s assets, financial 
results, distribution policy, development and extension 
initia
tives and investment/divestment approach.
Key strategic directions are periodically reassessed, 
ensuring 
identified risks are aligned to moving business 
objectiv
es, while adequately and efficiently addressing 
pot
ential negative impact on Group’s activities or 
correctly weighing the potential opportunities.
Key strategic directions
Pillar 1 – Growth
Preserve a high-quality portfolio of dominant assets
Delivering on development pipeline, positively 
c
ontributing to the property portfolio and 
income generation

Strategy cluster
Strategic risks emerge primarily from the critical decisions made by executive management while implementing the business strategy. 
T
hese decisions must navigate the ever-changing landscape of politics, economics, and social environment. Essentially, strategic risks 
pose a threat to the Group’s ability to achieve its business plan and core corporate objectives, and may even jeopardise the Group’s 
going concern.
The Group faces challenges in executing its investments and divestments policy precisely when market conditions are most favorable. 
Unf
oreseen fluctuations in real estate, financial markets, and capital markets can disrupt these plans. Adverse market movements have 
the pot
ential to impact the Group’s portfolio value, financial position, liquidity, operating income, and future prospects.
Limited 
new capital
Limitations on new capital injection, 
shortage of 
financing or re-
financing at acceptable cost, 
adv
erse changes in macroeconomic 
conditions or the Group's 
performance may lead to a rating 
downgrade and/or unavailability of 
capital, inability to fund property 
investments or development 
program, increased cost of 
finance.
Cash flow management is performed daily 
and forecasts for the next year are updated 
several times a year.
Other measures: Spread of sources 
and ma
turity of revolving credit 
facilities, committed but undrawn facilities 
maintained, continuing and extensive 
capital market and bank relationship 
management by the CFO and CEO.

Employees
Delays in 
execution 
of assets 
rotation strategy
Due to current circumstances (high 
int
erest rates, lack of liquidity in 
the market, many players being 
pressured to divest for different 
reasons), divestment process may 
be hinder
ed by the lack of sufficient 
pool of buyers and risk of not 
achie
ving a pricing that reflects the 
value of the asset.
The Group is not in the position to be 
f
orced to divest assets and the decisions 
on disposals are driven by strategic 
considerations and opportunity.
Alternative options are available to the 
Gr
oup (several scenarios of disposal, 
depending on market attractiveness), 
decisions being made with a view to 
maximise shareholders value on the long-
term.
A strong business disposal policy is 
in plac
e, setting out a structured 
framework used in decision-making 
process for disposals. Every decision is 
approved by the Board and the Board 
monitors on a quarterly basis compliance 
and performance.
Shareholders
Financing partners
Finance cluster
The Group constantly monitors its exposure to various financial risks, including interest rate volatility, liquidity, foreign exchange rates, 
equity markets. Applicable management policies guide these risk management efforts. The Group pays close attention to managing the 
inher
ent financial risks of its activity and to the financial instruments it uses.
The Group’s policy on credit, liquidity, and market risks, including currency and interest rate, as well as the management of those risks, 
ar
e disclosed in notes 3 and 5 to the financial statements.
The Group is subject to various tax regimes in the countries where it operates. In some jurisdictions, there is an increasing burden from 
c
ompliance and regulatory requirements, as well as a certain degree of unpredictability, which can lead to lower performance.

have enough liquidity to meet its liabilities 
when due, under normal and stressed 
conditions, without incurring unacceptable 
losses or risking damage to its reputation.
To ensure this approach is enabled, 
management pr
epares budgets, cash flow 
analyses and forecasts, which enable the 
Dir
ectors to assess the level of financing 
required for future periods.
Budgets and projections are used to assess 
an
y future potential investments and are 
compared to existing funds held on deposit 
to evaluate the nature, and extent of any 
future funding requirement.

Tax risk
The complex and ever-changing 
int
ernational tax environment, 
national regulatory developments 
and changes in the way the Group 
conducts its business mean that 
there is always an element of tax 
risk and uncertainty inherent in the 
Groups operations.
Also, changes in local and 
int
ernational fiscal legislation may 
ha
ve a wide variety of impacts on 
the compliance requirements and 
the tax position of the Group.
Similarly to other multinational 
gr
oups, NEPI Rockcastle faces 
significant uncertainty when 
multiple governments interpret 
transfer pricing arrangements 
and the tax treatment 
of intra-group, cross-border 
transactions differently.
 When 
such situations arise, management 
aims to seek assurance and 
resolution for any disputed 
transactions through appropriate 
domestic or international dispute 
resolution procedures.
The Group has a clear tax strategy applied 
c
onsistently across the Group's subsidiaries 
with risks and functions clearly defined. 
All the transfer pricing benchmark analyses 
ar
e conducted by an external transfer 
pricing advisor and are aligned across the 
entire Group.
A Transfer Pricing Policy and application 
Guidelines ha
ve been developed in line 
with OECD guidelines on the application of 
arm’s length principles and domestic laws 
and has been implemented since 2022.
The OECD tax measures and initiatives, 
Eur
opean Directives as well as local 
fiscal legislation are closely monitored, 
while adequate processes and controls 
are implemented to ensure fiscal 
compliance.  Also, local and international 
fiscal legislation is closely monitored, and 
processes and controls are implemented to 
ensure fiscal compliance.

Operational cluster
Property development and management activities entail typical risks, such as insufficient building maintenance leading to a 
degr
adation of portfolio, health and safety risks, business continuity improperly managed, budgets overrun, improper tenant relationship 
management, over-reliance on a single third party.
Utilities cost 
increase risk
Utilities cost increase might trigger 
higher oper
ational costs.
This may (i) have a direct 
impact on the Gr
oup’s NOI, (ii) 
cause leakage in service charge, 
(iii) increase tenants' operational 
costs and create potential 
issues in the collection process, 
(iv) negatively impact producers/
distributors/suppliers/consumers 
(e.g., materials, logistics 
cost increase).
The Group implemented adequate 
budgeting, mor
e sustainable and more 
viable alternative energy sources (such as 
photovoltaic panels in Romania), protective 
contractual clauses, backup for existing 
suppliers to prevent potential business 
interruptions in case they become insolvent 
(due to costs increase).
New digital solutions planned aimed to 
gener
ate utilities costs savings.

Remuneration report
The Remuneration Report, which has received approval 
fr
om the Remuneration Committee, serves to guarantee 
that the remuneration policy, practices, and performance 
indicators of NEPI Rockcastle are in alignment with the 
Board’s vision, the Group’s core values, and business 
objectives. The primary objective of the Remuneration 
Report is to 
offer a thorough overview of the Group’s 
remuneration strategy and policy applicable to the 
Directors and staff members.
1. Key principles of remuneration
The Remuneration Report is intended to provide a 
c
omprehensive portrayal of the Group’s remuneration 
strategy and policy for Directors and staff.
The Group’s remuneration policy is strategically designed 
t
o inspire Executive Directors and employees to strive 
for the Group’s growth and success. It is applicable 
to all staff categories, from the Group’s senior and 
middle management to subject matter experts and non-
managerial employees.
The Group’s philosophy is rooted in the belief that 
r
emuneration serves as the foundation for sustainable 
economic growth. Simultaneously, it acts as a powerful 
force in reinforcing NEPI Rockcastle’s culture, values, and 
long-term business strategy.
The Remuneration Policy is targeted at fostering a 
perf
ormance-driven corporate culture, robust enough to 
compete in a rapidly evolving market – one characterised 
by turnover, low unemployment, expertise scarcity and 
increased workforce mobility.
It has been designed to fairly differentiate
 the 
reward packages for all employees, in line with roles’ 
complexity, professional experience, competence, and 
performance achieved.
Remuneration plays a pivotal role in attracting and 
r
etaining high-caliber employees in a competitive global 
market, fostering a strong performance-oriented culture, 
and motivating the delivery of expected business results.
The Remuneration Committee and management are 
f
ocused on ensuring that the remuneration strategy:
• underpins the corporate and people strategy and 
serv
es as a critical element in employees’ motivation 
and delivery of business results 
• is clear, flexible, transparent, and fair, and its 
implementa
tion is a top priority for the management 
team; and 
• is market competitive by providing an appropriate 
balanc
e between pay elements, role and performance, 
motivation, and stability.
The key remuneration principles outlined by the 
Gr
oup remain constant, as they competitively position 
the Group’s policy in the market and serve the 
business strategy:
Performance-driven pay – The Group’s remuneration 
is 
influenced by the role and performance of the 
employee, as well as the performance of the Group. 
NEPI R
ockcastle has implemented a transparent process 
for establishing short-term and long-term measurable 
objectives, based on Objectives and Key Results (OKR). 
This ensures a heightened focus on those crucial business 
elements and results that are directly linked to business 
performance and shareholders’ return. The process of 
setting objectives is structured around two significant 
pillars, which guarantee that business targets together 
with pr
ofessional conduct and values are the key elements 
of robust performance. Each employee and Executive 
Director establish annual objectives structured as follows:
• Business Objectives: Key Performance Indicators 
(KPIs
) and strategic priorities (with associated OKRs) 
• Personal Development Objectives: These are set 
t
o enhance skills and competencies that can lead 
to career progression, consolidation of stronger 
leadership competency at the Group’s level, 
improvement of productivity, or identification of new 
s
trengths and abilities
Objectives set at the start of the year are progressively 
measur
ed throughout the year, with an expectation of 
an interim review for proper monitoring. The interim 
review, although not mandatory, is important to ensure 
that everyone is aligned with the target and delivering 
towards the business plan. At the end of the calendar year, 
objectives are evaluated against results.
Competitive pay – The Group is committed to offering 
competitive remuneration packages to its employees 
and Ex
ecutive Directors, and it observes relevant market 
benchmarks and reward insights. NEPI Rockcastle ensures 
that remuneration components are market-aligned, 
between the median and the maximum of the market for 
top performers.
Total annual pay
 – Remuneration is defined as a total 
annual pack
age and consists of three main components: 
• Fixed Pay 
• Variable Pay: Short-term and long-term incentives, 
which can be delivered in both cash and share awards, 
as per the Group’s incentive plan. The rules of this plan 
were last approved by shareholders in 2022 (‘the New 
Incentive Plan Rules’). 
• Individual and Collective 
Benefits
Variable pay as a differentiator – The Group’s 
R
emuneration Policy emphasises variable pay structures 
as enhancers of differentiated total pay, in line with 
performance, seniority, and complexity of the role, 
predetermined objectives, and expected impact on 
the business. This is measured in terms of results 
delivered and managerial capabilities to develop, lead, and 
motivate people.
Fair pay
 – When setting pay levels and packages, the 
Group aims to achieve internal equality (similar pay for 
similar roles, levels of complexity, and experience) and 
external fairness (pay determined considering the market 
levels and dynamics). NEPI Rockcastle is committed 
to providing fair pay to all employees and pay-related 
decisions are free from any discriminatory factors such as

Annual pay review process – Remuneration reviews occur 
annually
, coinciding with performance evaluations. Their 
purpose is to validate that the remuneration process 
contributes positively to the business and aligns with 
the performance review framework. The annual review 
takes into consideration the business results, personal 
development and individual achievements, as well as 
external factors such as market circumstances, reward 
benchmarks, and workforce dynamics.
2. Internal and external factors influencing 
remuneration related decisions
The Group c
 onstantly monitors both internal and 
external factors that impact its markets, industry, 
and overall business. This vigilance allows the 
Group to adapt effectively to the changing context 
and maintain c
ompetitiveness. 
Wider external factors
The NEPI Rockcastle Group oper ates in competitive 
markets which are influenced by a diverse range 
of f
actors:
• Dynamic Macro Environment: the changing economic 
and business landscape affects how remuneration is 
structured and adjusted
• Turnover Changes: fluctuations in employee 
turnover rates impact workforce stability and 
compensation planning
• Hybrid and Remote Arrangements: the shift toward 
hybrid work models and remote work influences 
compensation policies and benefits
• Market Competitiveness: to attract and retain talent, 
NEPI Rockcastle must remain competitive in terms of 
compensation packages
• Skillset Availability: the availability of specific 
skills in the labour market affects recruitment and 
retention strategies
• Transparency and Pay Equity: there is a growing 
demand f
or transparency in remuneration practices 
and ensuring pay equity across roles
• Geographical Specificity: NEPI Rockcastle operates 
in multiple geographies, each with its own unique 
context and regulations
An es
sential external factor impacting NEPI Rockcastle’s 
markets, workforce dynamics, and stability—both directly 
and indirectly—is the ongoing Ukraine–Russia military 
conflict. This conflict establishes a persistent backdrop 
of unpredictability, necessitating constant vigilance and 
prioritising employee safety. Given that five of the Group’s 
oper
ational countries share borders with either Russia or 
Ukraine, the war-induced pressure significantly influences 
workforce stability, engagement, and focus. Throughout 
20
23, the Group's commitment to employee safety 
remained unwavering, maintaining regular communication 
with the teams to ensure they had access to relevant 
resources, comfort, and security.
The 
migration of skilled professionals, primarily 
t
o Western Europe and more developed 
regions, remains crucial for talent availability and 
overall retention. This trend exacerbates the shortage 
of resources and skills, placing greater 
pressure on costs and workforce planning.
The shift toward hybrid, flexible schedules, and remote 
work has become the new norm, significantly influencing 
recruitment decisions. While some companies in our 
mark
ets have leaned more toward physical presence, the 
demand for increased flexibility remains strong among 
emplo
yees and candidates. This flexibility extends beyond 
remote versus in-person work; it encompasses working 
hours, shorter workweeks, extended remote work during 
seasonal periods, and adaptable legal frameworks. These 
factors impact resource availability and may have longer-
term effects
 on resource planning.
Inflation remains a challenge across all the countries 
where the Group operates. The region faces economic, 
political, and military instability, rising energy prices, 
commercial restrictions, and local currency devaluation. 
Throughout 2023, the annual 
inflation rates in the Group’s 
c
ountries of operation remained high.
Annual Report 2023 12 7

R emuneration report
Moreover, pay levels have continued to rise across 
industries and experience levels in Central and Eastern 
Europe (CEE). The Group actively monitors reward 
dynamics in its operating markets, subscribes to reward 
reports, and engages in targeted review projects for 
specific
 markets and role levels. By maintaining constant 
visibility over benchmarks, NEPI Rockcastle can evaluate 
market movements. Although 2023 saw significant 
changes, increases at the regional, industry, and 
management le
vels were lower than in the previous year. 
Internal priorities and factors related to workforce
Resource planning and workforce scarcity remain critical 
int
ernal challenges stemming from workforce market 
dynamics. While the overall staff turnover at the Group 
le
vel has decreased, indicating increased stability, certain 
areas of the business still face market challenges.
The primary people-related priorities for the Human 
R
esources (HR) function and the management team 
were to safeguard the well-being of the Group’s 
employees
 and prepare them for potential crises, 
particularly in light of the ongoing Ukraine-Russia military 
conflict.
 Throughout 2023, business continuity, security, 
and health and safety measures remained central areas 
of focus. 
Internalisation of Property Management Functions - 
the ongoing internalisation of property management 
functions and teams, along with the alignment of 
practices and processes across the Group’s portfolio, 
remains a critical internal factor impacting people-related 
dynamics. These streamlined processes have had 
a positive impact on team dynamics and have resulted 
in significant operational efficiencies thr
oughout the 
Group. The internalisation process is still underway and is 
expected to be completed by 2024.
Strengthening Specialised Capabilities and Teams - 
in line with NEPI R
ockcastle’s strategic focus on 
business growth, digitalisation, technology enablement 
and sustainability, the Company continued to consolidate 
its core internal teams. These teams possess expertise 
in areas such as systems and data analytics, procurement, 
sustainability and renewable energy.
People Engagement
 - in the current context, influenced 
by both external and internal factors, maintaining high 
le
vels of employee engagement poses a challenge 
for employers. However, it also presents significant 
opportunities to implement people-related initiatives, 
enhanc
e communication, and design internal motivational 
and development programs for employees.
During 2023, the Group conducted its second Group-wide 
Employee Engagement Survey within the pas t two years. 
The purpose was to monitor engagement levels among 
internal teams and gain deeper insights into what factors 
contribute to employees’ satisfaction while working for 
NEPI Rockcastle.
The results of these surveys have been r emarkably 
positive. The People Engagement Index, standing 
a
t 82% as of 2023 (increased versus 2022) reflects a 
strong and high level of engagement. This positive 
context fosters team motivation, contributes to a healthy 
organisational culture, and ensures a professional and safe 
work environment.
The survey results are tr
 ansparently communicated and 
made available to management. They serve as a 
valuable platform for discussions and action planning. By 
addressing critical aspects highlighted by staff members, 
NEPI Rockcastle continues to be rated as a great place 
to work. The responses and feedback were assessed in 
an inclusive manner, ensuring data confidentiality and 
effective interpretation for future planning. 
The Remuneration Committee response to internal and 
external factors
Despite the external factors affecting the 
en
vironment and the Group’s business directly, NEPI 
Rockcastle effectively mitigated their impact on its results. 
Overall, the Group’s  Key Performance Indicators 
(KPIs) have been delivered above target, resulting 
in strong achievements for NEPI Rockcastle. 
The positive results achieved by NEPI 
R
ockcastle prompted management to make specific 
decisions r egarding remuneration. The Remuneration 
Committee and the Group’s management team 
jointly recognised that the 2023 performance was the 
outcome of intensive efforts, effective risk management, 
and s
trategic decisions. 
3. Engagement with stakeholders and 
implementing f
eedback
Executive and non-Executive Directors directly engage 
with in
vestors, discussing economic context, market 
factors, challenges, the Group’s achievements, results, 
strategic priorities and remuneration matters. Although 
not all stakeholders can be reached individually, 
Directors personally meet with major shareholders to 
solicit feedback.
At the June 2023 Annual General Meeting (AGM) , 
6
7% of shareholders voted in favor of the 
Remuneration Implementation Report. Shareholders 
were  invited to engage with the Chairman of 
the Remuneration Committee, regarding remuneration 
matters. This invitation was extended through an 
announcement following the results of the Annual General 
Meeting in June 2023 for the 2022 financial year (Results 
of Annual General Meeting). Furthermore, shareholders 
w
ere once again invited to engage in discussions 
with the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
and the Chairman of the Board. The Chairman of 
the Board had interactions with shareholders in South 
Africa in February 2024, following the 2023 results 
presentation. This provided an additional opportunity 
for direct engagement regarding remuneration matters, 
as communicated through an announcement at the 
beginning of 2024 (
NRP Engagement with shareholders 
on remuneration matters).

Feedback Theme The Group’s Response
Further disclosure on the 
benchmarking pr
ocess and 
reference market used
As per the Remuneration policy, the Group uses benchmarks, on a need basis, for both staff, Executive 
and non-Ex
ecutive directors. Executive and non-Executives’ remuneration undergo benchmarking 
approximately every 2 to 3 years, while staff may be assessed annually, as needed. Recently, NEPI 
Rockcastle analysed Executive Directors and non-Executive Directors’ pay levels during Q4 2022 and 2023, 
benefiting from the services of top international reward consultants (Korn Ferry). Employee benchmarking 
r
elies on regional and local salary survey data from reputable providers such as Mercer and Hays.
The reference markets for the conducted benchmark are presented below:

The fixed pay is aimed to be aligned with the market median, while, for strong and top 
performance, through the variable incentives (STIP and LTIP) the total pay may be set at or above the 
75th percentile. 
Further disclosure on 
the r
ationale and the 
application of the Board’s 
discretion of 25% 
In highly volatile and challenging market conditions, where business operations are impacted and 
management f
aces new priorities, relying solely on performance metrics becomes challenging. To address 
this, the Remuneration Committee temporarily exercised greater discretion over variable pay to ensure 
effective management incentivisation during this unpredictable period. However, the allocation of variable 
awards remains anchored in specific results achieved throughout the year, particularly on strategic projects 
critical f
or financial and operational KPIs.
In 2023, detailed descriptions of analysed strategic priorities are transparently presented 
in the Implementa
tion Report, illustrating the direct link between allocated awards and 
management performance.
Starting 2024, the Remuneration Committee, taking note of the shareholders’ feedback, has reduced 
the maximum thr
eshold for annual strategic priorities from 25% to 15%. The resulting difference will be 
alloca
ted for 2024 to the Operational Performance NOI and to the Qualitative Factors.
The retained 15% allocation for Strategic Priorities within the STIP provides the necessary flexibility. It 
allo
ws the Remuneration Committee to incentivise executive management to focus on specific projects 
or initiatives when external or internal factors impact financial and operational results, necessitating 
c
ounterbalancing actions.
Further clarification on the 
v
esting of unvested shares 
in situations of termination
The 2022 Remuneration plan allows for accelerated vesting, assessed on a case-by-case basis by 
the R
emuneration Committee. Acceleration criteria vary, including retirement scenarios. Full vesting 
is not strictly enforced, and decisions consider individual circumstances, contributions, roles, and 
termination details.
More visibility over the 
details and tr
aceability 
of the Sustainability-
related KPIs
Since 2022, sustainability-related KPIs have influenced STIP awards. The Group maintains this practice, 
pr
oviding enhanced visibility into performance measures and outcomes. Detailed information for 2023 is 
available in the Implementation Report.

R emuneration report
Feedback Theme The Group’s Response
Clarification on whether 
there are in place any 
reward-related provisions 
for change of controls 
and severance payments 
on termination of Executive 
Directors’ contracts
The R emuneration Committee  affirms that the Group’s Remuneration policy does not include provisions or 
specific clauses related to Change of C ontrols. Additionally, the policy does not mandate the Company to 
provide severance payments upon the termination of Executive Directors.
More clarity to be provided 
on the cla
wback provisions
The Remuneration Policy and the Rules of the Incentive Plan approved in November 2022 include specific 
details on the clawback mechanism. Clawback provisions apply to STIP and LTIP awards granted to key 
staff and Executive Directors. These provisions allow for recouping all or part of the awards (or their value), 
including distributions received on award shares, in case of gross misconduct, gross negligence, or material 
error within 2 years of STIP award allocation or LTIP award vesting.
The Board handles clawbacks for Executive awards, while Executives manage the process for Key 
Individuals. In the e
vent of a clawback event:
• Unvested LTIP Shares: these shares are immediately forfeited if the Participant’s contract ends
• Shares or Cash Repayment: participants must return a number of shares (up to the total allocated, 
including distributions) or an equivalent cash amount
• Method Combination: the Board or Executives may use a mix of these methods as appropriate
The 5-year Dutch law serves as the maximum timeframe, but 2 years is considered best practice and aligns 
r
easonably with pay levels under the scheme.
More clarity on the STIP 
and L
TIP KPIs calculation 
– whether the measures 
included are aligned with 
the Group’s strategy and 
are auditable.
The R emuneration report comprehensively outlines the  STIP and LTIP related KPIs. It provides 
specific information regarding the w eightage assigned to each KPI, along with pay-out 
ranges and determination scales.
The R emuneration Committee confirms that these performance measures within the STIP and LTIP 
ar
e closely aligned with the Group’s strategic priorities. Furthermore, they have a direct impact 
on the Group’s financial and operational performance, as detailed in both the Remuneration and 
Implementa
tion reports. 
The R emuneration Committee actively collaborates with 
external advisors and reward consultants to stay informed 
on critical aspects:
1. Overall Market Insights:
» The Chairman of the Boar d and/or 
the Remuneration Committee Chair 
and members actively participate in 
dedicated non-executive/reward workshops and 
cross-industry meetings.
» These engagements provide valuable intelligence 
on mark
et trends, best practices, and 
emerging developments.
2. Group’s Business Analysis:
»NEPI Rockcastle c
 onsistently analyses reports 
issued by external advisors related to the Group's 
remuneration practices.
» When necessary, adjustments are implemented 
based on these insights.
» Consulting advice is sought for remuneration 
polic
y presentation and transparency.
The goal is to align communication and disclosure 
pr
actices with market best practices, governance 
frameworks, and shareholder expectations. This proactive 
approach ensures that the Group remains well-informed 
and responsive in its remuneration strategies.
Non-Executive Directors Remuneration
No change was made to the non-Executive Directors’ 
(NED
) remuneration during 2023.
The most recent adjustment occurred in January 2021. In 
20
23, the Remuneration Committee reviewed NED fees 
considering the expanded complexity and responsibilities 
arising from the company’s growth, strategic initiatives, 
and relocation to the Netherlands. The move broadened 
the roles of 
specific Board members and increased their 
time commitment due to governance frameworks.
To assess market fee levels, an international reward 
c
onsulting firm, Korn Ferry Netherlands (‘The Consultant’), 
c
onducted a benchmark analysis. The selected benchmark 
peers included wider range of real estate, retail, and non-
retail companies of similar size and complexity across 
Western Europe, the United Kingdom and South Africa, as 
well as selected industry-relevant peer companies.
The benchmark exercise revealed that NEPI Rockcastle’s 
NED f
ees typically align with or slightly trail the 
median. The Remuneration Committee, benefitting from 
the C
onsultant’s experience and advice has formulated 
a proposal of NED fee increases to be applicable as 
of 1 January 2024, subject to being approved by the 
shareholders. Shareholder approval is sought at the 
upcoming Annual General Meeting.
Proposed increases will align with internal practices for 
both emplo
yees and management. The benchmark will 
serve as a reference point, with the intention to keep 
NED fees close to the median of the market. The 
intention is that fee reviews and benchmarking will not be 
done frequently.

Remuneration Committee priorities
During 2023, the Remuneration Committee focused on 
se
veral key priorities:
• Ensuring appropriate reward and motivation for 
the t
op management team, emphasising fair and 
competitive pay aligned with performance
• Supporting the management team amidst challenging 
mark
et conditions while upholding agreed-upon 
remuneration principles
• Engaging with shareholders to gather feedback and 
enhanc
e the existing Remuneration Policy
• Ensuring proper implementation of the Remuneration 
P
olicy and Long-Term Incentive Plan, in 
compliance with Dutch legislation and Corporate 
Governance standards
The Remuneration Committee’s ongoing objectives, 
pr
ocesses, and plans remain attuned to business needs, 
addressing internal and external factors and meeting 
stakeholder expectations, including those of employees.
Remuneration 
Committee's priorities Approach 2023 process
1. Group's Remuneration related priorities
Ensure remuneration 
motivates
 people 
for performance 
while 
managing the 
challenging and 
unstable business 
environment of 2023
The Group reviews variable and fixed 
remuneration annually. Performance of 
the busines
s and individual professionals 
is being assessed.
Variable pay is linked to KPIs and overall 
annual individual perf
ormance, while the 
fixed pay is linked to the complexity of 
the role.
In the context of the strong performance delivered by the Group 
and its t
eam, budgets have been distributed in line with business 
results, set at business function level.
Allocation of bonuses is agreed based on competencies, 
merit
ocracy, hardship, complexity of projects and strategic 
decisions managed within a specific business function. Emphasis 
is plac
ed on determining performance fairly throughout the 
performance management process, as this links into variable pay.
Decisions about the specific level of bonuses for management 
levels are taken at top management level (i.e., Directors of 
business functions), while team leaders are encouraged to assess 
performance and make relevant recommendations to reflect the 
c
ontribution of individual team members.
Variable remuneration for Executive Directors is determined in line 
with the R
emuneration Policy, KPIs and computation algorithm.
Ensure the Group's 
remuneration is aligned 
to the relevant 
mark
et and provides 
internal fairness
The Group frequently consults 
int
ernational independent remuneration 
experts to ensure a proper understanding 
of the benchmarks and determine actions 
to be implemented during the annual 
remuneration review processes.
The benchmark for the Executive Directors and top management 
w
as conducted with one of the top-tier international reward 
consulting company during 2022 and relevant changes in 
remuneration have been implemented with effect as of 1 January 
2023, as detailed in the Implementation Report.
The Group is committed to run such benchmark analysis bi-
annually or annually
, should the labour market or the international 
environment be dynamic or rapidly changing.
For staff members, the Group consulted general market reward 
reports and trends on expected salary growth at industry/country/
seniority levels. This is a process undertaken as part of the 
reward and compensation review, depending on the business and 
personnel immediate needs and decision-making.Ensure transparency 
of the Group's 
r
emuneration policy, 
pay levels and 
structures, objectives 
and adequate link 
between pay and 
business performance
 
The principles and details of Group's 
r
emuneration policy, including any 
changes made or anticipated are publicly 
presented in the Annual Report.
Meetings with management teams are 
held annually within the r
emuneration 
and performance review process to 
outline, explain and clarify decisions 
and rationale.
 
The 2023 Annual Report presents a compelling overview of 
r
emuneration for both Executive and non-Executive Directors, as 
well as principles of remuneration across the staff.
Allocation of staff cost budgets was done at business function 
le
vel, allowing top management team to take a wider responsibility 
over managing the process of reward review.
Individual discussions with team leaders were held by the HR 
Dir
ector and HR team to clarify:
• budget allocation
• principles of remuneration
• reward review and link to performance of teams and individuals

C
ommittee's priorities Approach 2023 process
2. Alignment and ethics of pay
Ensure alignment of 
all staff remuneration 
principles and pa
y 
structures across all 
countries in which the 
Group operates
The same remuneration review process 
is c
onducted at Group level and in 
all countries where NEPI Rockcastle 
is present.
The HR Director ensures the roll out 
of the pr
ocess is aligned and the same 
principles are applied across all countries.
The Remuneration Committee is informed 
about the perf
ormance and reward 
review approach.
The HR function is a centralised function which ensures HR services 
acr
oss the Group. Determination of specific remuneration at the 
le
vel of a team is done upon consultation with HR reward specialist 
who provides, for each position within the Group, an analysis of the 
job level, benchmarking against specific functions and geographies 
and makes recommendations in respect of appropriate pay levels.
This process ensures that same principles of pay are consistently 
applied acr
oss all grades, functions and countries.
Ensure remuneration 
is det
ermined 
without discrimination
The HR Director, as mandated 
b
y the executive management and 
Remuneration Committee ensures 
through detailed reviews of the reward 
processes that pay levels are set free 
from any discrimination based on: 
gender, age, race, religion, nationality, 
social status, social, political or religious 
convictions, or any other such elements.
Fixed remuneration is determined based on role, responsibilities, 
le
vel of competence and experience, while variable remuneration 
is determined based on performance, impact and contribution. No 
consideration is given during the hiring, or reward review process, 
to any other factor that could lead to discrimination, such as 
gender, age, race, religion, nationality, social status, social, political 
or religious convictions, or any other such elements.
The Remuneration Committee is also reviewing the principles, 
mechanisms and implementa
tion of reward review, to ensure that 
only role and performance elements are considered in reward 
determining decisions.
The HR department monitors relative pay of staff to ensure fairness 
and ethical pa
y principles are observed.
3. Shareholders' engagement and Corporate Governance
Ensure shareholders' 
f
eedback is observed 
and discussed
Regular meetings are held with shareholders upon presentation of financial results, where questions 
r
eceived and addressed by Executive and non-Executive Directors cover the entire range of topics, 
including remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee maintains contact with shareholders and discusses feedback with the Board 
aft
er voting at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. All shareholders have been publicly invited to 
provide their feedback on remuneration matters on 14 June 2023 and  8 January 2024. Replies were provided 
t
o those shareholders that engaged on the matter.
The Chairman of the Board also engaged in discussions and feedback inquiry on remuneration related matters 
with major shar
eholders during February 2024.
Comply with King IV 
r
equirements, Dutch 
Corporate Governance 
Code and other 
relevant corporate 
governance frameworks
The Board is actively promoting and encouraging management to continuously improve Corporate Governance 
and alignment with t
o relevant corporate governance frameworks.

4. Key decisions in 2023
Area Group’s decision
Staff remuneration
Fixed pay
The 2023 pay review has been finalised. The salaries adjustments are applied on a selected basis, after a need and 
opportunity analysis, and have been determined to:
• reflect market levels and conditions as presented in Section 2 (Internal and External Factors Influencing 
Remuneration Related Decisions)
• maintain internal fairness and equity
• ensure adequate levels of motivation, engagement and retention in the current market circumstances
Salary and 
bonus pool
Staff cost budgets were set at business function level, deriving from the Group level budget – to allow for more 
flexibility and accountability over remuneration-related decisions.
The HR reward function, head of functions and CEO supervise the consistent application of remuneration principles 
acr
oss the business. Variable pay decisions are calibrated at Group level with the functional leaders, CEO and HR 
Director, ensuring consistent application of reward principles.
Executive Directors' Remuneration
Fixed pay
Significant changes in the structure of the executive management’s team have been made over the past two years, 
which resulted in the appointment, effective 2022, of a new CEO, CFO and COO. After the first  year in which the 
new management team has performed and demonstrated strong performance and leadership, the Remuneration 
Committee has reviewed the pay levels of the Executive Directors to reflect their contribution and acquired 
e
xperience in the roles. Moreover, a reward benchmark analysis was conducted to ensure proper alignment with 
the market levels.
Based mainly on the proven capability to drive the strategy and growth of the company, corroborated with the 
s
trong performance and seamless transition into the roles of all three Executive Directors, the fixed pay for all three 
e
xecutives has been adjusted effective 1 January  2023.

Incentive 
Plan (STIP)
KPI structure, composition and weighting align the impact over business and are aimed to reward and reflect role’s 
specificity by:
• differentiating between roles – different KPIs for different roles
• applying different weighting for same KPIs for different roles
While the weights between the categories of measures remained unchanged, for 2023, the Short-Term Incentive 
plan (S
TIP) determination process included more specific and granular measures under the Qualitative Factors.
Moreover, Annual Strategic Priorities category (under the assessment of the Board) has been introduced to provide 
f
or more clarity around STIP determination and to clearly reflect the link between delivery of results and strategy 
and the v
ariable payout to the Executive Directors.

REMUNERATION POLICY
Scope
The R emuneration Policy is centered on the Group’s 
mission, long-term value creation, and business continuity, 
with a keen focus on stakeholder interests. Key principles 
drive NEPI Rockcastle’s remuneration strategy:
1.Value Creation by Teams:
» Acknowledging individual and 
c
ollective achievements
» Developing top professionals, fostering 
inno
vation, and acquiring new skills
» Ensuring team stability by retaining skilled 
k
ey professionals
2. Principles Guiding the Policy:
» Performance-Driven Pay: rewarding results 
and c
ontributions
» Competitive Pay: aligning pay with market 
s
tandards, business complexity, and relative size
» Total Annual Package: considering all 
c
omponents of compensation
» Variable Pay: tying incentives to performance
» Fair Pay: ensuring equity and transparency
» Annual Pay Review: regularly assessing and 
adjus
ting compensation
To evaluate the effectiveness and ensure sustainability 
of both the strategy and principles, the Group observes 
specific fundamentals of implementation:
Clarity - the Group’s Remuneration Policy, frameworks, 
and mechanics prioritise transparency and clarity 
through effective communication with shareholders and 
human capital.
Simplicity - the remuneration structure rests on 
straightforward pillars: fixed pay, benefits, and variable 
short- and long-t
erm compensation. Determination of 
variable pay is linked to individual performance (via 
annual performance reviews) and Group performance 
(publicly disclosed, with detailed shareholder discussions).
Risk Management
 - the Remuneration Policy and 
associated processes proactively address risks of 
excessive pay or underpay through key controls 
that include:
• Validation and Equity
: The Remuneration Policy 
undergoes validation during review or hiring, 
considering internal equity, market data, and 
social consensus.
• Executive Directors’ Pay: market benchmarking 
ensur
es alignment with market standards. Stakeholder 
involvement is also considered.
• Internal Pay Ratios: Ongoing analysis monitors pay 
progression. Any anomalies trigger discussions within 
the management and Remuneration Committee.
• Variable Pay and Performance: Variable pay is directly 
link
ed to performance reviews. Remuneration reviews 
occur post-performance review to ensure alignment.
• Group-Level Calibration: Performance results are 
calibrated at the Group level for consistency across 
roles, impact, and seniority.
• Annual Reward Reviews: Variable pay awards 
ar
e discussed annually within the Remuneration 
Committee, involving the Human Resources Director 
and CEO.
• Strategic Alignment: Individual KPIs and objectives 
align with busines
s KPIs and strategic direction.
• Ethical Considerations: Performance reviews include 
360-degr
ee feedback, emphasising behaviours, values, 
and ethics. Unethical behaviour is addressed before 
awarding variable pay.
• ESG Integration: Environmental, Social, and 
Go
vernance (ESG) components are embedded in 
performance reviews for Executive Directors and 
senior management.
Predictability
 - the Group’s Remuneration Policy and 
implementation mechanisms prioritise predictability. Total 
awards are influenced by market trends, internal pay 
decisions, and the link t
o individual performance and roles 
and Group’s performance. Sliding scales and performance 
incentive zones for Executive Directors’ core KPIs enhance 
predictability of maximum variable payouts.
Proportionality
 - the Remuneration Policy emphasises 
linking individual awards to strategy delivery and long-
term Company performance.
• Avoiding Poor Performance Rewards - specific 
elements prevent rewarding poor performance:
» Bonus pools activate at specific achievement rates, 
subject t
o Group’s management and Remuneration 
Committee approval
» Policy rules exclude rewards for below-
e
xpectations performance and enforce 
consequence management
• Alignment to Culture - The Group’s core values shape 
behaviour and drive performance. Remuneration 
philosophy aligns with these values:
» Integrity: fair and transparent pay
» Excellence: linking pay to performance
» Innovation: adapting to market dynamics
» Collaboration: engaging stakeholders in 
r
emuneration practices

Philosophy
The Group’s Remuneration Policy has been metic ulously crafted to achieve several key objectives:
1. Equitable Compensation: the policy aims to provide fair and market-related compensation f or all employees. This 
ensures that each individual is remunerated in alignment with their role, competence, performance, and conduct;
2. Differentiated Reward Packages: recognising the diverse contributions of employees, the policy tailors reward 
pack
ages to suit individual circumstances. This differentiation ensures that exceptional performance and innovation 
ar
e appropriately acknowledged;
3. Market Anchoring: compensation is anchored at the market median, ensuring competitiveness within the industry. 
However, the policy goes beyond mere market alignment. It strategically positions compensation to exceed market 
levels when employees demonstrate exceptional value creation for stakeholders.

IMPLEMENTATION AND GOVERNANCE
In accordance with the f ormal corporate structure, 
the Remuneration Committee assumes a critical role 
in overseeing the Remuneration Policy and its 
implementation and plays a critical role in ensuring 
equitable compensation practices and transparency within 
the organisation.
1. Committee Responsibility
: the Remuneration 
Committee is entrusted with ensuring that the 
Remuneration Policy aligns with legal requirements. 
Their duty extends to proposing the establishment 
or modification of the policy, which is subsequently 
pr
esented for approval at the annual general meeting;
2. Director Compensation: both Ex ecutive and non-
Executive Directors fall under the purview of 
the Remuneration Committee. They propose the 
remuneration packages for these directors to 
the Board of Directors;
3. Voting Mechanisms
:
» Mandatory Vote: as stipulated by Dutch law, 
the Remuneration Policy undergoes a mandatory 
vote at least once every four years. The next such 
vote is scheduled for 2026
» Advisory Vote: The entire Remuneration Policy is 
subject to a non-binding advisory vote annually 
during the Annual General Meeting in accordance 
with the JSE Listings Requirements. The 
upcoming vote will occur in 2024;
4. Transparency
: The Remuneration Report, an integral 
part of the Group’s Annual Report, provides full 
disclosure of the compensation for both Executive and 
non-Executive Directors. This encompasses all awards, 
whether directly paid to the executives or to service 
companies under their control, as well as fees paid to 
non-Executive Directors.

REMUNERATION DESIGN
Pillar Description Purpose and link to strategy
Fixed pay
All staff
Guaranteed and fixed pay, determined by role and responsibilities, 
e
xperience, competence, qualifications, and expertise. The median of 
the relevant market is used as a reference point for determining the 
level of fixed pay.
Adjustments can be made for specific circumstances, achievements, 
and r
esponsibilities.
Reviewed annually to ensure internal and external equity, correlation 
t
o role and responsibilities (especially in case of role change or 
competence/qualifications uplift).
The Group aims to remain the dominant 
c
ommercial real estate investor and 
operator in Central and Eastern Europe. 
Hence, its teams should comprise 
top professionals: qualified, experienced, 
c
ompetent, and motivated.
The Group's target is to attract, motivate and 
r
eward specific skillsets needed, especially 
considering a competitive labour market with 
high scarcity of property and commercial real 
estate skills and qualifications.
Short-term 
incentive 
plan (STIP)
All staff paid 
in cash
Variable pay delivered for achievements against short–term objectives 
set in adv
ance. Variable pay relates to the employees' role. The more 
senior an employee is, the more they can impact the Group's results; 
hence the higher proportion of variable pay in their annual package.
Under-delivering against objectives leads to no variable pay.
Categories of seniority used for staff STIP are: non-managerial, middle 
management and subject matter experts, and senior management.
STIP total variable pay is subject to achievement of business targets 
and budgets.
NEPI Rockcastle aims to remain among the 
bes
t performing retail real estate companies 
in CEE and continue to deliver great 
results against challenging targets. Variable 
pay is designed to incentivise individual 
contribution to business results. The stronger 
the performance, the higher the variable pay.
Long-term 
incentive 
plan (LTIP)
Executive 
Directors and 
key 
staff
Shares awards
Annual share awards made to participants based on the Group's 
achie
vements of three-year trailing KPIs (internal and external).
Quantum of allocation is determined as a percentage of annual 
fixed
 pay.
Vesting period of three years for Executive Directors (cliff vesting at 
the end of the 3-
year period) and for key staff (tranche vesting over 
3 years). For Executive Directors there is a mandatory lock-up period 
(sales restriction) for an extra 2-year period after vesting, resulting in a 
total lock-up for 5 years from the date the award is allocated.
Although the LTIP is primarily settled through shares as per the above, 
the NEPI R
ockcastle Incentive Plan can allow for LTIP to be settled 
in cash.
NEPI Rockcastle aims to drive achievement of 
ambitious s
trategic priorities and keep senior 
management and Executive Directors focused 
on long-term value creation.
The Group's long-term interests should be 
aligned with those of senior management and 
Ex
ecutive Directors.
A medium- to long-term retention of key 
pr
ofessionals is essential to the business.
Benefits
All staff
Medical services based on subscription or medical insurance, the cost 
of which is partially or fully c
overed by the Group.
Meal allowance/vouchers as per local legislation.
Access to sports facilities – cost of subscription partially covered by 
the Gr
oup.
Other wellbeing benefits, including work flexibility and hybrid work.
Healthy, and motivated employees are more 
efficient and deliver better results.
Ensuring stable teams is essential, and the 
Gr
oup can play an important part in educating 
lifestyle-related habits.
Each element of remuneration is described in more detail 
belo

the Group's long-term and short-term incentive plan.
Fixed pay
The Group’s approach to fixed
 pay balances market 
alignment, performance, and equity considerations. Please 
see below more details on fixed pay:
Market Positioning:
• The strategic approach is to align the fixed 
pay for both emplo yees and Executive/non-Executive 
Directors with the market median. Additionally, for 
specific critical roles, the aim is to position 
compensation above the median, reaching up to 
the 75th percentile. These specific roles are identified 
by assessing factors such as impact on the 
NEPI R
ockcastle’s business and operations, market 
scarcity, turnover trends, and the unique nature of 
the roles
Benchmarking:
• To determine appropriate fixed remuneration levels, 
the Group conducts benchmark against relevant 
markets.  The Group is committed to consulting 
market benchmarks on a need basis to ensure external 
equity. For this purpose, NEPI Rockcastle engages top-
tier reward consultants with expertise in relevant 
industries and markets
138 NEPI R ockcastle N.V.

Page 139:
Annual Review:
• Remuneration undergoes an annual r eview to validate 
both internal and external equity. Any necessary 
adjustments are made based on this assessment
• The Group’s policy emphasises the significance 
of achie vements and performance in determining 
competitive pay. Consequently, salary increases are 
considered in specific scenarios:
» Change of role and 
responsibilities (e.g. promotions)
» External equity: addressing significant gaps 
compared to relevant market benchmarks
» Internal equity: ensuring similar pay for similar 
roles in comparable geographies
» Labour and pay market dynamics: responding to 
significant
 shifts in the market
Loans and Guarantees:
• The Group does not pr ovide loans or guarantees to 
either Executive or non-Executive Directors.
Variable pay – STIP
•Employees
 - for employees, the STIP is determined as 
a proportion of their annual fixed pay. Several factors 
ar
e considered:
• Role: the employee’s role influences the tar get bonus 
rate - this varies based on whether they hold 
non-managerial, middle management/subject matter 
expert, or senior management positions
• Individual Performance: each employee receives 
an individual perf
ormance rating during the annual 
evaluation process, typically on a scale of 1 to 5
• Company Performance: the STIP also considers the 
company’s performance relative to the bonus pool 
level and availability
» Financial Performance: metrics such as growth 
in distributable earnings per share and investment 
grade rating
» Operational Performance: factors like gr owth 
in Net Operating Income (NOI), accepted 
vacancies, collection rate, and gross rental 
income increase
» Debt Risk Management: considerations related 
t
o debt maturity
» Qualitative Factors: these include ESG 
(En
vironmental, Social, and Governance) strategy-
related measures and successful execution 
of energy-photovoltaic projects
» Annual Strategic Priorities: alignment with the 
organisation’s strategic directions
• Executive Directors - for Executive Directors, the STIP 
is det
ermined through a clear, measurable algorithm. 
This algorithm leads to a coefficient tha t is applied 
to their annual fixed pay. The algorithm incorporates 
measures aligned with business KPIs, categorised 
as follows:
Review and Adaptation - annually, the specific KPIs within 
the above categories and their weights are reviewed. 
Adjustments may be made to better reflect the unique 
roles of Executive Directors or the business key 
f
ocus areas.
In summary, the STIP ensures that both employees 
and Ex
ecutive Directors are incentivised based on 
performance, strategic priorities, and business success.

The objectives are established for the 12-month financial 
period c urrently under review. The achievement rate is 
calculated based on the specific weights agreed upon for 
each individual measure.
STIP varies from 100% a t target to a maximum of 170%, 
which is applied to the annual fixed pay.
For specific KPIs such as growth in distributable earnings 
per share, net operating income, maximum accepted 
vacancies, collection rate, and gross rental income 
increase, a sliding scale is applicable. This scale ranges 
from 50% for the minimum level to 100% for the target 
level and 200% for the maximum level.
The STIP is paid out if a minimum of 7 5% of the KPIs 
are achieved.
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate 
in the S
TIP. They receive an annual fee in their 
capacity as members of the Board of Directors and 
committees, as approved by shareholders during the 
Annual General Meeting.
Variable pay – LTIP
The LTIP
 awards are granted to Executive Directors and 
key staff in accordance with the NEPI Rockcastle’s 
Incentive Plan. Eligible employees and Executive Directors 
receive an allocation of restricted shares, which vest 
as follows:
• Executive Directors: the shares fully vest at the end 
of a thr
ee-year period. Afterward, they remain subject 
to a lock-up period of two years, resulting in a total 
of five years fr om allocation before the shares can be 
freely traded
Annual Report 2023 13 9

Page 140:
» continued
R emuneration report
• Key Staff: the shares vest in tranches over a three-
year period
For key staff, the allocation amount is determined based 
on a c
ombination of the employee’s fixed pay and S TIP, 
taking into account individual overall annual performance, 
the role and the business impact.
The LTIP allocation process is finalised between February 
and Mar
ch each year, following the completion of the 
performance review for the previous financial year. 
Additionally, other LTIP allocations may occur based on 
factors such as employment, promotion, or retention as 
part of a remuneration package.
Executive Directors’ LTIP award allocation depends on the 
achievement of both internal and external measures. 
The internal measure involves assessing the thr ee-year 
compound annual growth rate of distributable earnings 
per share relative to an indexation-linked benchmark. The 
resulting percentage is then multiplied by an internal 
hurdle factor of 20.
The external measure is det ermined by comparing 
the Total Shareholder Return to a relevant set of 
peers approved by the Remuneration Committee. The 
calculation of the respective KPI is as follows:
• If the Group’s performance falls within the top quartile, 
50% of the annual fixed pay is applicable
• If the Group’s performance falls within the second 
quartile,  25% of the annual fixed pay is applicable
• If the Group’s performance falls within the bottom two 
quartiles, the applicable percentage is zero
The 
LTIP determination for Executive Directors’ 
performance is approved by the Remuneration 
Committee and is settled through share awards without 
any attached loans.
Clawback provisions
According to the R emuneration Policy and the 
Rules of the Incentive Plan approved and published 
by the Group, clawback provisions may apply to  
STIP and LTIP awards granted to key staff and Executive 
Directors. These provisions allow for the recoupment of 
all or part of any awards under the STIP or LTIP (or their 
value), including distributions received on award shares, in 
specific circumstances:
1. Gross Misconduct, Gross Negligence, or Material 
Error: if any of these events occur or are discovered 
within 2 years of the allocation of an STIP award 
or the vesting of LTIP award shares, the clawback 
provisions apply
2. Decision-Making Authority
:
» Executive Awards: the Board decides on 
clawbacks for Executive awards
» Key Individuals: executives are responsible for 
cla
wbacks related to Key Individuals
3. Clawback Event Identification:
» Unvested LTIP Shares: if a Participant’s contract 
ends, unvested LTIP shares will be  f orfeited and 
lapse immediately
» Shares or Cash Repayment: participants must 
return to the company a number of shares 
equivalent to the total allocated award, including 
corresponding amounts received as distributions, 
either in cash or equivalent shares
» Method Combination: the Board or Executives 
ma
y use a mix of these methods as 
deemed suitable
4. External Factors: new laws, regulations, or social 
de
velopments may impact the eligibility for awards 
under the STIP
These provisions ensure accountability and align with 
r
esponsible corporate governance practices.
Internal pay ratio
When determining the remuneration of Ex ecutive 
Directors, in accordance with the Dutch Corporate 
Governance Code, the Remuneration Committee takes into 
account the progression of the internal pay ratio between 
the pay of the Executive Directors and that of a relevant 
reference group of employees.
The Company aims to ensure alignment with 
the principles outlined in the R
emuneration Policy. 
This involves reasonably weighing the position and 
responsibilities of managing a listed company against 
reward levels. The goal is to achieve a reasonable 
proportionality with the salaries and employment 
conditions of all Company employees and management.
Pay ratios in r elevant markets where the Group has teams 
and operates business and asset portfolios are  reviewed. 
The methodology and the relevant ratios are transparently 
reported annually in the Implementation Report. 
Ratio between fixed and variable pay
The remuneration structure for Ex ecutive Directors is 
carefully designed to cultivate alignment between 
management and shareholders in both the short- and 
long-term. It emphasises performance-driven outcomes 
and its balanced approach ensures a dynamic and 
motivating compensation framework. For performance 
delivered in line with internally set targets, fixed 
pay accounts for approximately 30%
 of the total 
compensation, while variable pay (STIP and LTIP) 
accounts for approximately 70%.
Minimum and maximum levels of variable pay as per the 
remuneration framework
The remuneration framework for Ex ecutive Directors is 
carefully designed to ensure a performance threshold for 
variable pay and to define the conditions under which no 
v
ariable award is granted.
Minimum Levels:
1. Minimum/Zero STIP: the cumulative achievement 
of KPIs mus
t reach 75%. If the achievement falls 
below this threshold, the STIP award is capped 
at the equivalent of the Annual Strategic Priorities 
percentage, as specified in the STIP KPIs table.
140 NEPI R ockcastle N.V.

Page 141:
2. Minimum/Zero LTIP Award:
» The cumulative compound annual growth 
rate (CAGR) over a three-year period mus t 
exceed indexation + 1%. Failure to meet this 
criterion results in a zero LTIP award for this 
component of the KPI.
» The Total Shareholder Return of the C ompany is 
compared to selected peers. If the Company’s 
position falls outside the first or second quartile, 
the L
TIP award for this component of the KPI 
is also zero.
Maximum Levels: As part of the framework, a maximum 
r
emuneration is designed for extraordinary performance. 
The Remuneration Committee determines this based on 
business circumstances:
• For STIP awards, the maximum award is capped 
at 170% of the annual fixed pay
• For LTIP awards, the maximum award is capped 
a
t 270% of the annual fixed pay
Termination of employment
For proper management of risks related to pay and 
t
ermination of employment, the Remuneration Committee, 
the CEO and Human Resources Director prioritise the 
following considerations:
Notice Period
:
• For staff, the notice period does not exceed 6 
months in any of the jurisdictions where the 
Company operates
• For Ex ecutive Directors, the notice period is 3 months
Fixed Pay and Benefits:
• Fixed pay and benefits are discontinued when 
employment ceases
• However, applicable benefits may continue to be 
provided during the notice period
Short-Term Incentive Plan (STIP):
• Entitlement to STIP will lapse upon t ermination of 
employment, and no further payments will be made
• On a discretionary basis, the executive management 
(f
or staff) and the Remuneration Committee (for 
Ex
ecutive Directors) may decide to award a portion 
of the STIP for the period worked until the 
termination date
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP):
• Unvested awards under the L TIP shall be forfeited in 
their entirety and will lapse immediately in the event of 
a fault (bad leaver) termination
• In the case of a no-fault (good leaver) termination:
» Executive management (for staff) and the 
R
emuneration Committee (for Executive Directors) 
have discretion to determine whether unvested 
awards shall vest as scheduled, on an accelerated 
basis (all, part, or pro rata), or lapse, as well as to 
determine the application of lock-up for awarded 
shares of Executive Directors, as detailed in the 
Implementation Report for the respective period
» Upon the death of an employee or Executive 
Dir
ector, all unvested awards vest, and shares are 
released from lock-up
Severance Pay:
• Severance pay may be granted upon termination of 
emplo
yment as required by law or based on the 
conditions of termination (fault/no-fault terminations).
• The decision lies with the executive management 
(f
or staff) and the Remuneration Committee (for 
Executive Directors).
Non-Executive Directors' fees
The non-Executive Directors receive compensation based 
on their r
ole through an annual fee, which is paid on a 
monthly basis. Any increases in the NED fee are proposed 
by the Board and these proposals are approved at 
the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.
Additionally, the Group c overs or reimburses travel, 
accommodation, and logistics costs incurred by NEDs in 
relation to the performance of their duties.
Executive Directors’ agreements
The remuneration of the Ex
 ecutive Directors is determined 
by the terms outlined in their services or employment 
agreements with the Group or its subsidiaries. 
These agreements are typically indefinite and c omply 
with applicable laws.
The service agreement also includes terms related to 
an agr
eement between the Group or a subsidiary 
and the service company controlled by the Executive 
Director. These terms are intended to be consistent with 
the Remuneration Policy. In case of any inconsistency 
between the services or employment agreement 
and the Remuneration Policy, the terms of the 
agreement will prevail.
The Ex

IMPLEMENTATION REPORT
Executive Directors' remuneration
Variable Pay
The v
ariable pay components tied to the  2023 results (STIP 
and LTIP) were determined based on performance criteria. 
In December 2023, the Remuneration Committee reviewed 
these criteria, considering the preliminary assessed 
performance. Later, upon final results computation, 
the C
ommittee validated the variable pay components 
on 12 February 2024, based on the actual performance for 
the year. 
1. 2023 STIP AWARD DETERMINATION
The 2023 STIP KPIs have been structured in three 
main ca
tegories:
Quantitative KPIs (Financial and Operational performance 
and Debt Management)
• The quantita tive KPIs are designed to link 
performance within operations (such as NOI Organic 
Growth, Vacancies, Collection rate, and Gross Rental 
Income) and financing (including Liquidity and Debt 
Risk Profile) to the investment profile and distributable 
earnings f
or shareholders. The sliding scales apply to 
specific KPIs that have the potential to significantly 
impact distributable earnings and the Group’s 
o
verall performance. 
• The financial and operational KPIs have been set 
in alignment with published guidance and internal 
budgets. The chosen levels for financial metrics 
reflect the ambition to maximise growth potential, 
building on the strong growth achieved during 2022. 
The 2023 targets represent a normalised growth 
pace, several years post-Covid-19, when the business 
was significantly affected. These targets reflect 
a s tabilised business, returning to solid operational and 
financial results.
Qualitative KPIs
• The decision to introduce ESG qualita tive KPIs in 
remuneration aims to focus the executive management 
on several critical aspects: 
» Defining a robust Sustainability Strategy tha t aligns 
with the Group’s long-term goals
» Monitoring progress agains t Sustainability 
Agencies’ ratings and adopting 
relevant methodologies
» Implementing strategic ESG projects, such as 
the suc
cessful installation of photovoltaic panels 
across the Romanian portfolio (which is the largest 
portfolio within the Group)
Annual Strategic Priorities
The Annual S trategic Priorities have a crucial role in the 
performance delivered each year. These priorities focus on 
critical projects related to the overall Group’s performance 
and strategy implementation.
This category encompasses four types of projects: Asset 
Management, Finance, Business Operations and People 
and Culture.
Each year the strategic priorities and expected 
achie
vements are discussed, agreed upon, and 
delivered under the leadership of the Executive Directors. 
These priorities drive the Group’s success and ensure 
alignment with its long-term goals. 
In 2023, the following Strategic Priorities w ere closely 
monitored to determine the total quantum of variable pay 
for executives:
• Greenfield development and opening of 
Promenada Craiova 
• Greenfield development of Vulcan Residence project
• Renewable energy business stream development
• Management of all upcoming 2024 and 2025 loan 
ma
turities and maintenance of adequate level of 
revolving credit facilities 
• Employee Engagement Survey participation 
and r
esults
For 20 23, it is important to note that it was the  first full 
year for each executive director in their current roles. For 
the purpose of determining variable pay in 2023, the total 
quantum allocated to the Annual Strategic Priorities 
categories was set at 25%.
Given the discretion of the R
 emuneration Committee to 
assess and award pay based on the completion of the 
Annual Strategic Priorities, and considering the successful 
delivery against all strategic projects, the Committee has 
confirmed that the respective 25% will be awarded in full.
Below are the details of the achievements related to 
the Annual Strategic Priorities:
Asset Management
• Promenada Craiova: The greenfield development of 
Pr
omenada Craiova was successfully delivered within 
the agreed timeline and budget. All leasing-related 
targets were met and operational KPIs exceeded 
expectations in areas such as footfall, turnover, and 
media coverage
• Vulcan Residence
: Despite challenges in the 
residential market, credit market tightening, and 
changes in Romanian taxation for residential assets, 
the Group’s 
first residential project achieved its 
sales tar
gets. Out of 254 apartments (total area of 
18,300m2), 186 were sold at initial prices (without any 
disc
ounts) by mid-February 2024, aligning with pre-
agreed targets
Finance
• Management of all upcoming 2024 and 2025 loan 
ma
turities (signing of a syndicated unsecured loan 
agreement of €387 million led by IFC for the 
management of 2024 bond maturity, €116 million 
extension of secured loans maturing in 2024,

€346 million extension of revolving credit facilities 
ma
turing in 2024 and 2025) which ensures and 
strengthens a safe balance sheet allowing the Group 
to focus on growth and pursue opportunities in 
the market
Business operations
• Licensing one of the Group’s subsidiaries to 
c
onsolidate energy-related activities in Romania is 
a strategic move. This step not only brings further 
efficiencies to the Group's operations but also allows 
NEPI Rockcastle to develop its renewable energy 
business stream
People and Culture
• The Gr oup’s Employee Engagement Survey achieved 
an impressive participation rate exceeding 90%. 
Mor
eover, the engagement index increased compared 
to 2022, reaching a satisfaction rate of 82%. This 
high level of engagement is essential for ensuring 
teams’ performance, motivation, and commitment to 
contributing to the company’s achievements. Detailed 
disc
ussions of the survey results were held across the 
Group, and relevant actions have been planned and 
delivered during 2023 and will continue into 2024
Starting 2024, the Remuneration Committee, taking 
not
e of feedback from shareholders, has decided to 
reduce the maximum threshold for the annul strategic 
priorities from 25% to 15%.  The resulting 
difference will 
be alloca
ted for 2024 to the Operational Performance 
NOI and to the Qualitative Factors. The retained 15% 
allocation for Strategic Priorities within the STIP provides 
flexibility. It allows the Remuneration Committee to 
incentivise the executive management to focus on specific 
projects or initiatives when external or internal factors 
impact financial and operational results, necessitating 
c
ounterbalancing actions.
The overview of STIP measures, targets and results

or 2023 are included in the below table illustrating

2. 2023 LTIP AWARD DETERMINATION
The LTIP award determination is based on two measures:
External measure – Total Shareholder Return (TSR) 
comparison to relevant peers
The TSR is a significant and relevant benchmark for 
as
sessing shareholders’ performance in relation to the 
market. While TSR is not directly tied to the individual 
performance of Executive Directors and the management 
team, it is heavily influenced by various market conditions. 
By incorporating TSR into LTIP determinations, the 
Remuneration Committee aims to align award levels with 
the performance achieved compared to relevant peers.

Internal measure
The internal measure is the compound annual growth 
r
ate of distributable earnings per share relative to an 
indexation-linked benchmark. The result, as a percentage, 
is multiplied by an internal hurdle factor of 20.
[CAGR in distribution per share – (Indexation+1pp)] *

• 3-year CAGR in distribution per share (as of 2020 - 
20

• Indexation: 7.3%+ 1% = 8.3%
• Internal hurdle factor is 20
• Overall achievement: 139.8%
The CAGR has a pivotal role in determining the 
L

over consecutive years, aligning executives’ interests as 
shareholders with the company’s performance.

the CEO pay ratio and five-year average employee 
c
ompensation are to be disclosed in the annual 
Remuneration Report.
In line with the Dutch regulatory provisions, the average 
emplo
yee compensation should be computed as total 
personnel costs reported in the financial statements as 
"Staff cost" divided by the average headcount.

non-managerial positions, whose a
verage salary is below the average pay at the level of the company.Staff costs do not include any LTIP awards, any training, 
personal de
velopment or wellbeing related costs
CEO Pay ratio – excluding LTIP awards
For consistent comparison and analysis, the Group reviews internally the CEO pay ratio which does not include the LTIP 
a
wards neither for the CEO, nor for employees - as LTIP awards are granted to a limited number of staff members. This 
belo
w ratio also considers the gross personnel costs, excluding the netting effect of the property management income

R emuneration report
No change was made to the non-Executive Directors’ 
(NED
) remuneration during 2023.
The most recent adjustment occurred in January 2021. In 
20
23, the Remuneration Committee reviewed NED fees 
considering the expanded complexity and responsibilities 
arising from the company’s growth, strategic initiatives, 
and relocation to the Netherlands. The move broadened 
the roles of specific
 Board members and increased their 
time commitment due to governance frameworks.
The Board intends to propose an update of non-Executive 
Dir
ectors annual fees levels and structure starting 2024. 
These proposed increases adhere to internal practices 
for employees and management, market benchmarks, 
inflationary
 trends, and prevailing rates across the 
markets where the NEDs operate. Additionally, third-party 
benchmarks have contributed to informing this proposal. 
The intention is that future fee reviews will not be frequent 
and will be c
onducted on a need basis.
Shareholders will have the opportunity to vote on 
this pr
oposal during the upcoming Annual Shareholders 
Meeting, and detailed information will be provided in the 
meeting notice.

Sustainability report
INTRODUCTION
Message from the CEO
The critical state of our planet and the need for everyone 
t
o play their part in driving positive change continued 
to be a focus in 2023. Ensuring that NEPI Rockcastle 
contributes to making the world more sustainable is 
one of our key objectives. With the Group's core values 
guiding our decisions, we once again made good progress 
in addressing the changing climate crisis. At NEPI 
Rockcastle, we understand that to secure a thriving future 
for our business, we need to generate a positive impact 
on communities, future talent, and the environment. This 
can only be achieved by going beyond simple mitigation, 
towards a restoring and regenerating mindset.
We pledge to remain devoted to improving our habitats 
and activities, t
o make a significant leap towards 
emis
sions reduction, to act with integrity and respect 
towards people, communities, and nature. Our shopping 
centers continue to deliver convenience, inclusion, and 
accessibility, enabling the communities to use them not 
only for shopping, but equally for socialising, education, 
healthcare, and this remains core to our vision.
Sustainability is embedded in our business decisions. 
W
e see sustainability and profitability going hand in 
hand and believe that in today’s business landscape 
one can no longer look towards the future without 
considering both. The production of renewable energy, 
an endeavour we commenced in 2022 and continued 
to invest in throughout 2023, is one such example 
where the environmental and 
financial objectives are 
perfectly aligned.
Our sustainability strategy can be defined as focusing on 
sus
tainable buildings and partnerships, as well as creating 
an attractive, professional, and ethical work environment. 
It represents the foundation of everything we do and 
guides our efforts to reduce the environmental impact 
and increase the future socio-economic performance of 
our business.
In implementing that strategy, we continued to reduce 
emis
sions, energy intensity and use of district heating in 
our properties, as well as to support the communities 
in which we operate. We have revised and re-set our 
targets in accordance with the SBTi (Science Based 
Targets initiative) methodology and have defined more 
ambitious KPIs f
or our standing portfolio. We continued to 
certify our properties based on BREEAM, illustrating the 
commitment to greener cities in the region where NEPI 
Rockcastle operates.
While I am proud of where the sustainability journey has 
tak
en us so far, continued effort is still required to achieve 
our ambitious goals. B
y continuing to apply a sustainable 
mindset to all actions, I am confident that we will do 
our part to ensure a greener and safer tomorrow for the 
future generations.

Executive summary
The Group has demonstrated its commitment to 
sus
tainability through addressing the most significant 
challenges and opportunities facing its business, industry 
and society
. As a leader in the CEE Region, with presence 
in nine countries, developing, owning, and managing 
shopping centers, industrial and 
office buildings, the 
Gr
oup’s sustainability strategy has established a sector-
leading approach for creating resilience, positive impact, 
and meeting stakeholders’ requirements, all while 
adhering to its core values.
With increasingly recognised concerns across a broad 
spectrum of En
vironmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) 
topics, the landscape in which NEPI Rockcastle operates is 
continuously evolving. Market trends and regulations are 
advancing towards greater pressure for the management 
and reporting of sustainability and climate-related issues. 
These trends are particularly relevant for the real estate 
industry, given its notably high carbon footprint and 
sustainability impacts. Against this backdrop, the Group 
has 
defined its sustainability strategy, core pillars, and 
material issues in line with relevant international climate-
related disclosure recommendations and standards.
Group’s sustainability strategy and its green funding 
s
trategy are intertwined, working in tandem to drive 
positive change. Notably, the Group has elevated the 
ambition level for its financing framework, and as of 2023, 
it aligns its r
eporting with the requirements of the EU 
Taxonomy, serving as catalysts to advance its sustainable 
business model.
NEPI Rockcastle’s sustainability performance report 
f
or 2023 outlines management’s approach to various 
Environmental, Social, and Governance topics, structured 
under three pillars.
• Pillar one: Invest in healthy and sustainable buildings 
extensively covers environmental topics, with a special 
f
ocus on climate change
• Pillar two: Be a trusted partner for our stakeholders, 
focuses on social topics pertaining to the Company’s 
sites, operations, value chain (tenants, customers, 
suppliers), and the wider community
• Pillar three: Create an attractive, professional and 
ethical work environment, outlines the governance, 
human rights and w
orkforce management approach
Throughout 2023, the Group continued its commitment 
t
o maintaining a BREEAM-certified standing portfolio, 
increasing use of electricity from renewable sources, 
based on on-site production or sourcing, and launching 
initiatives to further improve energy efficiency. As a 
r
esult, compared to 2022, the Group achieved a 31% 
reduction in carbon emissions from operations (scope 1 
and 2), a 15% reduction in carbon emissions from scope 3 
(tenants’ energy consumption), and 19% reduction in total 
emissions, marking 
significant progress toward its goal of 
achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.
The Group advanced in monitoring and enhancing its 
en
vironmental and socio-economic performance, invested 
in its teams through training and development programs, 
surveyed customers in order to 
refine its customer 
e
xperience approach and hosted community events 
throughout the entire portfolio.
Investments in 2023 covered initiatives implemented 
acr
oss operational assets, aiming to reduce emissions, 
enable efficient use of energy, promote biodiversity, 
consume water resources responsibly, encourage 
sustainable mobility. These were supported by buildings 
improvements, including those recommended during the 
BREEAM certification process.
In 2023, the Group received the Silver Award from 
the P
olish Council of Shopping Centers (PRCH) for 
“Strategy and ESG activities” - the Jury emphasised "the 
wide range and comprehensiveness of the ESG activities 
carried out, the ambitious goals and the spectacular tree 
planting campaign".
The Company committed to the Science Based Targets 
initia
tive (SBTi) by redefining its decarbonisation targets 
in line with scienc
e and the globally recognised SBTi 
methodology. Validation by SBTi is ongoing.
To better identify and address climate change issues, NEPI 
R
ockcastle comprehensively analysed the climate-related 
risks and opportunities in its portfolio. This was grounded 
in the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-
Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and considered 
the recently issued IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosure 
Standard, planned to replace TCFD recommendations as 
a market reference from 2024 onwards.
This report covers the impact of the entire portfolio 
of 60 buildings, acr
oss nine countries in the 
CEE region. It aligns with the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI) – Comprehensive, the European Public 
Real Estate Association Sustainability Best Practices 
Recommendations (EPRA sBPR) and the EU Non-
Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) laid down in the 
Dutch Decree on disclosure of non-financial
 information. 
The alignment with these, including TCFD and relevant 
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN 
SDGs), is presented in the Framework mapping chapter 
of this report, page 232.

GROUP SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY
Sustainability governance
The Group continued to maintain its position as ESG 
leader in the CEE r
eal estate market, validated by 
strong benchmark ratings. The Group is committed 
to reducing emissions and energy intensity and to 
reaching the set targets by 2030. This includes 
evolving processes and data quality, maintaining the 
support of the investors, tenants, customers, partners, 
the communities, and its employees. Appropriate and 
sustained governance is of paramount importance in 
steering the sustainability 
efforts.
The Sustainability Committee, comprising Executive and 
non-Ex
ecutive Directors of the Board of Directors, actively 
oversees the development and implementation of durable, 
long-lasting policies, and monitors the progress made 
by the Group against the targets included in the 
sustainability strategy. The Executive Directors regularly 
engage in dialogue with the Board on key sustainability 
aspects and ensure that the long-term strategy enables 
growth in a sustainable and responsible manner, 
considering the risks and opportunities associated with 
key environmental (including climate change), social and 
governance matters.
The sustainability strategy is monitored at the highest 
le
vel by the executive management, i.e. by the CFO, as the 
Executive Director part of the Sustainability Committee, 
and ultimately by the CEO. The Company appointed a 
Group Head of Sustainability to lead the execution, track 
progress of implementation of sustainable initiatives, and 
report on the status of meeting the set targets.
The Group Head of Sustainability reports to the CEO 
and w
orks closely with internal and external stakeholders. 
The Group Head of Sustainability has regular contact 
with the Sustainability Committee, having the primary 
responsibility to advance the sustainability agenda and 
to prioritise focused and concerted actions across the 
portfolio. The Sustainability Data Analyst is responsible 
for the data collection and analysis for the entire Group, 
using a specialised data collection platform called Deepki. 
In 2023, a Sustainability Manager joined the sustainability 
team, coordinating the risk and opportunities assessment 
process, as well as implementation of development and 
operational procedures across the Group.
The Group Head of Property Management is tasked 
with championing the en
vironmental program in the 
assets, closely monitoring progress towards targets, 
implementing energy efficiency
 programs and obtaining 
BREEAM certification. On a local level, each asset and 
c
enter management team is responsible for maintaining 
the buildings, proposing and executing action plans and 
CAPEX investments, regularly reporting and tracking the 
environmental data.
As part of the Group’s business transformation, the Group 
Head of Ener
gy joined the team, with the mandate to 
design and implement an integrated energy strategy 
for the entire portfolio. The energy team is developing, 
coordinating, and implementing strategies and policies 
to reduce consumption of energy from non-renewable 
sources and to increase return on investment from on-
and-off-site
 production of renewable electricity.
Specific KPIs have been defined and embedded in the 
annual performance assessment for key management 
levels, from the Executive Directors downwards to 
center management teams, to link environmental and 
climate performance to personal performance measures 
and remuneration.
The ESG strategy recognises the responsibility on the 
management le
vel and integration of physical climate 
change into regular risk assessment and business 
operations. In line with the strategy, NEPI Rockcastle 
is committed to prepare a climate adaptation plan for 
each asset.
Policies and procedures
The Group has implemented comprehensive policies to lay 
out ESG principles and r
esponsibilities. An annual review 
of all Group policies is undertaken to ensure compliance 
with laws and regulations, incorporate learnings and 
feedback, facilitate business evolution and transformation, 
and align with best practices embodied in relevant 
Environmental Management Systems standards. The main 
purpose of these policies and procedures is to ensure 
that each asset within the NEPI Rockcastle portfolio 
complies with regulations and internationally recognised 
best-practice frameworks.

Sustainability risks and opportunities
Managing risks and seizing opportunities ensures NEPI 
R
ockcastle's resilience amidst the climate crisis and 
escalating ESG concerns. The conventional financial risk 
management appr
oach is augmented by environmental, 
social, and governance considerations, expanding the 
concept of financial value. Stakeholders nowadays 
r
equire proactive responses to environmental, social, 
governance risks and opportunities which are re-shaping 
the busines
s strategy.
This section focuses on broader Environmental, Social, 
and Go
vernance concerns, associated risks, their 
transformative impact on the real estate industry and how 
the Company approaches mitigation measures.
Risk area Description of potential impact of the risk Management approach to mitigate risks and 
seize opportunities
Event-driven (acute) 
physical risks
Extreme weather events have the potential to cause 
dir
ect damage to assets or indirect supply-chain 
disruption (resulting from flood, storm, or wildfire). 
Materialisation of these risks require costly mitigation 
actions and can lead t
o changes in assets valuation. 
Furthermore, insurance may become more costly 
or even unavailable in case assets are exposed to 
significant physical climate-related risks.
NEPI Rockcastle assesses acute physical risks and 
plans adapta
tion activities to make its properties 
more resilient to extreme weather conditions. The 
adaptation plans are based on the results of 
climate risk assessment conducted in 2023, which 
will be further developed for the most pressing 
physical hazards, that the Company monitors via its 
Sustainability reporting platform, Deepki.
Chronic physical 
risks / climate 
adaptation challenges
Long-term shifts in climate patterns (e.g., temperature 
changes, w
ater scarcity, drought) can affect buildings 
oper
ations and increase operating costs. They can 
also affect assets valuations and drive significant 
adaptation and investment needs. Negative effects 
include heat stress, which impairs physical and mental 
perf
ormance. Heat can also damage materials (e.g., 
through deformation) and thus lead to the impairment 
of infrastructure.
NEPI Rockcastle plans adaptation measures 
addr
essing chronic physical risks, based on the 
results of the climate risk assessment prepared 
in 2023. Such measures are prioritised based 
on the climate change risks assessment and the 
geographical distribution of the Group’s portfolio.
Sustainability 
performance
Real estate assets generate significant environmental 
impacts, including r
esource consumption (energy 
and water), waste generation, and impact on 
people’s health. There is growing pressure to improve 
buildings’ sustainability performance, including 
enhancing resource efficiency and adopting circular 
economy principles.
The Company is committed to enhance the 
sus
tainability performance of its buildings from 
both a structural and operational standpoint. The 
BREEAM methodology is used to evaluate and 
certify the sustainability of the portfolio.
During construction, the Company carries out the 
lif
e-cycle assessment (LCA), which considers several 
environmental impacts and the global warming 
potential from a whole life-cycle perspective.
Carbon footprint
Buildings generate significant carbon footprint, both 
during c
onstruction and in operation. Therefore, the 
real industry sector is affected by growing regulatory 
pr
essure to reduce GHG emissions and decarbonise 
operations. On the other hand, this is also related to 
energy market risk (resulting from the transformation 
of the energy sector), which entails volatility of 
prices and limited availability of energy from various 
sources – which can impair achieving strategic 
decarbonisation goals.
Reducing GHG emissions is one of the key focus 
ar
eas in NEPI Rockcastle’s strategy. This is addressed 
by shifting to lower-emission energy sources 
including on-site renewable electricity production 
and reducing gas and district heating consumption.
In 2023, the Company revised its decarbonisation 
tar
gets in accordance with SBTi, a globally 
recognised methodology. These are under validation 
by SBTi.
Energy performance
Real estate assets require significant energy for 
development and operations, which makes energy 
management a significant industry issue (more 
recently due to energy pricing volatility, electricity 
price increases, and energy-related regulations are 
becoming more stringent).
NEPI Rockcastle is committed to improving 
the ener
gy efficiency of its assets. Energy 
perf
ormance considerations are integrated into 
property investment analysis and technical due 
diligence in the acquisition process. Energy 
efficiency improvements and related capital 
in
vestment are a crucial part of NEPI Rockcastle’s 
operational strategy.
Water management
Growing water scarcity (expected to increase due 
t
o climate change), waste of the water and 
operating costs show the importance of careful 
water management. In retail properties, water is 
consumed mainly by restaurants for food processing 
and through use in restroom areas by the visitors. 
Poor water management in these areas can negatively 
affect
 operating costs, environmental impact, and the 
Group’s reputation.
NEPI Rockcastle is consciously prioritising water 
management in its as
sets. Risk mitigation practices 
include prevention of excessive water use, 
careful monitoring and reducing potable water 
consumption, reusing where feasible and using grey 
water where possible. Going forward, the Company 
aims to develop a formal water management plan, 
as well as develop a protocol of action to reduce 
risks to shopping centers workers and visitors during 
water stress events.

Risk area Description of potential impact of the risk Management approach to mitigate risks and 
seiz
e opportunities
Resource and 
energy dependency
The real estate sector traditionally demands 
significant
 natural resources, including energy. 
Amongst other, the scarcity of resources, and 
the growth of population/market pressure/local 
conditions, may increase prices. Assets that require 
more raw materials and resources to build and 
operate are exposed to these cost pressures with 
potential impact on their valuation, or even license 
to operate.
NEPI Rockcastle is committed to reducing resource 
and ener
gy dependency of its assets to enhance 
the Company’s climate resilience, independence, 
and competitiveness. With 
significant investment in 
on-site photovoltaics the Company is shifting to 
lower-emission energy sources and decentralised 
energy production. This contributes significantly 
to the Group's sustainability targets, but also 
enables the C
ompany to become less energy-
dependent and more resilient in front of future 
regulations and market changes. Other potential 
measures include securing alternative water supply, 
improving waste management and adopting circular 
economy principles.
Management of 
tenants and suppliers 
sustainability impacts
As the largest listed owner, developer and manager 
of shopping c
entres in CEE, the Company can be an 
agent of change and drive sustainable practices in its 
supply chain (first level) as well as educate and raise 
a
wareness of its suppliers, to positively influence their 
decision making.
A significant part of real estate sustainability impacts 
is generated by tenants’ operations and activities. 
Still, real estate owners can play an important role in 
influencing
 the sustainability impacts of their tenants.
NEPI Rockcastle has developed, in consultation with 
r
elevant stakeholders, the Environmental Policy and 
the Sustainable Procurement Policy. These reflect 
the commitment to achieve effective environmental 
management and efficient property maintenance in 
its assets.
In relation to tenants, the Company introduced 
the ‘Gr
een Appendix’, aiming to promote alignment 
with circular economy, energy efficiency and climate 
change mitiga
tion best practices, as well as 
developed various awareness campaigns.
Waste management
Waste generated by tenants and customers is a 
significant
 sustainability issue for the real estate 
industry. Poor waste management increases demand 
for raw materials, adds to the carbon footprint and 
generates increasing costs.
NEPI Rockcastle is committed to contributing to 
a cir
cular economy and promoting environmentally 
responsible behaviours. The Company enables and 
encourages recycling and is adopting data collection 
and monitoring processes to reduce the avoidable 
waste going to 
landfill.
Regulatory environment 
and compliance
A fast growing environmental concerns and climate 
tar
gets set by the EU imply more stringent regulations 
to limit GHG emissions, e.g., carbon tax, energy 
efficiency
 targets, construction code changes.
Fast-evolving regulatory environment may lead to 
significant non-compliance risk, potentially leading to 
fines, penalties, or reputational issues.
NEPI Rockcastle's climate long-term target is to 
achie
ve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, through 
energy efficiency improvements and investment into 
renewable energy sources.
The Company is continuously monitoring the 
r
egulatory landscape, developing capabilities and 
tools to support climate-related risk analysis and 
make agile reporting adjustments.
Legal liability and 
management 
accountability
Given the climate-related physical and transition 
challenges c
ompanies risk being sued for:
• greenwashing (unsubstantiated claims of 
sus
tainable actions);
• damages due to climatic physical risks whose 
ma
terialisation could have been prevented but the 
company failed to do so:
• failure to transform towards sustainable 
oper
ations and development
The Company is committed to continuous 
risk analy
sis and sustainability-related disclosure 
enhancement. Data collection procedure and 
process scrutinised and improved on an on-going 
basis to adapt to requirements while improving the 
level of control.
In the context of legal liability, NEPI Rockcastle is 
monit
oring litigation trends and is actively mitigating 
the risks of greenwashing and non-compliance. To 
raise awareness regarding the adverse consequences 
and hazards associated with greenwashing, a 
training campaign is scheduled for 2024.
Technology risks related 
to transition to low-
carbon economy
Transition to low-carbon economy entails risks related 
t
o availability and prices of relevant technologies, 
including innovative building management systems, 
low-emission energy sources, and climate change 
adaptation solutions. This relates to stranded asset 
risk, uncertainty of technology availability and 
transition viability in case of assets with a higher 
carbon footprint and sustainability impact.
To address transition technology-related challenges, 
NEPI R
ockcastle regularly monitors relevant 
technological developments and conducts 
assessment of climate change adaptation and 
mitigation solutions. The Company introduces 
innovative solutions in pilot projects with 
support from best-in-class external advisors and 
experienced professionals.
Material downward 
changes in market 
valuation of properties, 
insurance cost 
and availability
Exposure to significant physical, or transition climate-
related risks may lead to changes in valuation, higher 
cost or even non-availability of insurance coverage for 
the assets. This may have a potential impact on the 
financial
 position, credit rating and access to capital.
The Company’s strategy focuses on reduction 
of carbon f
ootprint and sustainability impacts 
of its properties, as well as climate change 
adaptation measures. NEPI Rockcastle aims to 
develop and enhance capabilities to analyse and 
manage climate-related risks, evaluate and certify 
the sustainability performance of its properties 
and prepare transparent and extensive disclosures. 
These measures mitigate risks related to change in 
valuation and insurance cost.

seiz
e opportunities
Uncertainty of market 
and consumer trends and 
supply chain risk
Consumers are increasingly conscious of their 
sus
tainability impacts. Trends towards more 
responsible consumption are also reinforced by the 
unfolding cost-of-living crisis (due to higher energy 
prices, 
inflationary pressures and increasing interest 
rates). Supply chains are also prone to unpredictable 
economic shifts and technological advancements.
NEPI Rockcastle is committed to regular 
and c
ontinuous engagement with all relevant 
stakeholders, to monitor market trends, and to adapt 
its strategy to help navigate uncertainties in the 
dynamic landscape.
The Group secures key resources in due time 
based on longer-t
erm supplier contracts and builds 
partnerships with core suppliers.
Reputational risk
Growing environmental and climate awareness 
tr
anslates into growing expectations and regulatory 
pressure for non-financial climate-related reporting. 
Stakeholders and investors expect companies to 
identify, assess, prioritise, and monitor climate-related 
risks and are increasingly including climate risks into 
their investment decisions. Failing to meet these 
expectations may affect a company’s reputation.
NEPI Rockcastle’s ambition is to maintain its 
r
eputation for excellent sustainability performance, 
effective climate risk management, transparent, 
best-in-class climate-related reporting. This involves 
continuous engagement with stakeholders, careful 
monitoring of market trends and expectations, 
with support from external experts with relevant 
experience in climate change management.
While some of the risks have a greater potential to affect 
the Group’s resources and operations, such as climate 
change
, resources scarcity, volatility in emerging markets, 
waste management, and circularity, there are other risks 
that are rated as moderate or low in the Company’s 
context and locations, such as loss of biodiversity and 
natural disasters. The Group also recognises opportunities 
such as increased access to the sustainable financing 
market, costs reduction following circular economy 
appr
oach or following the implementation of resource 
efficiency measures.
Climate change risks and opportunities
As part of its enhanced risk management approach, 
the C
ompany performed a comprehensive analysis of 
climate-related risks and opportunities in its portfolio, 
in alignment with the TCFD recommendations and 
following principles defined in the IFRS S2 Climate-related 
Disclosur
e Standard (IFRS S2). The Company is working 
towards full compliance with IFRS S2 Standard in its 
climate-related disclosures, to be achieved in 2025.
Climate-related physical and transition risks refer to 
the pot
ential negative effects of climate change on a 
c
ompany. Physical risks are resulting from climate change 
that can be event-driven (acute physical risk) or from 
longer-term shifts in climate patterns (chronic physical 
risk). These risks could carry financial implications for 
an entity
, such as costs resulting from direct damage 
to assets or indirect effects following supply-chain 
disruption. The entity's financial performance could also 
be affected by changes in water availability, quality of the 
services or equipment, as well as extreme temperature 
changes affecting the entity's premises, operations, 
supply chains, tr
ansportation needs and employee health 
and safety.
Transition risks and opportunities were determined based 
on mark
et trends using data sets from recognised 
institutions, benchmark analyses and interviews with 
selected internal stakeholders. The risks were rated and 
prioritised by combining the potential likelihood with their 
estimated impact.
In the short- term, the energy and climate performance 
of the Gr
oup’s assets was identified as both the 
most relevant risk and opportunity. In terms of risk, 
increased costs due to high energy demand and 
price fluctuations, decreased access to capital due to 
stakeholder concerns regarding climate performance, 
planning and communication, compliance with carbon-
related legislation were prioritised by the Group. As 
for the opportunities, green buildings offer potential 
pr
ospects of new income streams. Going forward the 
Group will continue to monitor the performance of its 
assets based on the identified risks and opportunities and 
the investment needs.
The Company plans to further strengthen its capacity 
and t
o refine its approach to identifying and managing 
clima
te change risks and opportunities, as well as to 
continue with transparent and above-average climate-
related disclosures. The planned work aiming compliance 
with IFRS S2 disclosure standard will focus on assessing 
the current and anticipated effects of climate change-
r
elated opportunities on (1) the Company’s business 
model and value chain, (2) the Company’s strategy 
and decision-making, (3) the financial position, financial 
performance and cash flows (for the reporting period and 
anticipated over the short-, medium- and long-term), (4) 
the resilience of the Company’s strategy and business 
model taking into account identified climate-related risks, 
changes, de
velopments, uncertainties and opportunities 
(including the focus on strengthening the methodology 
for climate-related scenario analysis).
The relevant climate-related risks were incorporated 
int
o the Group-wide risk management processes and 
enterprise risk management system, described in detail in 
the Risk Management section of this report, page 104

Materiality assessment
In 2022, NEPI Rockcastle conducted a thorough 
ma
teriality assessment to identify key sustainability 
priorities. Using the GRI standard, topics critical to the 
Company's sustainability were assessed and prioritised. 
Same focus continued in 2023, while a double materiality 
assessment is planned for 2024, aligning with the 
Corporate Social Reporting Directive requirements.
A Group-wide employee survey was rolled out as part 
of the ma
teriality assessment performed in 2022, to 
gather the internal perspective on most significant 
impacts. The survey results were further calibrated in a 
f
ocus group with representatives from key areas in the 
Company, calibrated with key owners in the management 
team, presented to the Sustainability Committee for 
consideration and approval, then sent to the Board for 
final
 endorsement.
The Group identified and prioritised its key focus items 
of medium and high risk
s and opportunities on which to 
base its short- and medium-term priorities. Understanding 
the context in which NEPI Rockcastle operates allowed 
a more focused review of the topics to be considered 
in the materiality assessment. The following aspects 
were considered:
• NEPI Rockcastle’s material topics
• Industry and geographies-relevant topics
• Best practices in the real estate industry
• Main concerns voiced by the investment community
• Primary ESG risks and opportunities, including 
clima
te change
• Potential changes in legislation in the countries where 
the C
ompany operates
The matrix below reflects the outcomes of the 2022 
materiality assessment while during 2023 NEPI Rockcastle 
continued to address same material topics, reprioritising 
some of the most pressing issues.

INVEST IN HEALTHY AND SUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS (PILLAR 1)
Overview
Climate change and environmental issues have become 
a gr
owing global concern. More frequent extreme 
weather events are causing damage to buildings and 
infrastructure while changing climate conditions lead to 
increased adaptation costs and investment requirements. 
Concurrently, countries and organisations are intensifying 
efforts
 to limit their carbon emissions to align with 
the Paris Agreement, reduce environmental impacts and 
address sustainability challenges. Transition to climate 
neutrality is the centrepiece of the European Green Deal. 
Given that buildings in the EU are responsible for 40% 
of energy consumption and 36% of carbon emissions, the 
real estate sector plays a pivotal role in climate policy, 
facing significant regulatory pressure to reduce its carbon 
f
ootprint and environmental impact.
Acknowledging the transition challenges, including those 
r
elated to the fast-evolving regulatory environment, the 
Company has the ambition to transform them into 
business opportunities. The Group has already undertaken 
active efforts to improve the sustainability, resource 
efficiency, and energy performance of the buildings, also 
b
y engaging with tenants and business partners.
While important steps have been made on the path to 
clima
te neutrality, NEPI Rockcastle acknowledges that 
there is still a long way to go.
The Group aims to reduce the use of primary energy, 
gr
eenhouse gas emissions, potable water, non-recycled 
waste output, and pollution, through specific targets and 
activ
e management. NEPI Rockcastle strives to maintain 
a high standard in its assets, including green building 
certifications (with a commitment to have 100% of 
the eligible s
tanding portfolio certified before annual 
sus
tainability reporting) and maintaining biodiversity in 
the surrounding areas.
In 2023, the Company committed to the Science Based 
T
argets initiative (SBTi) and redefined its decarbonisation 
targets in line with science and the globally recognised 
SBTi methodology. Proposed targets are under the 
validation by SBTi.

1 As described on page 163, the Company joined SBTi and refined some of its targets. Following the process, starting with 2024, new or updated targets will be 
applicable
. Initial targets remain with 2019 baseline, while the newly established targets will utilise 2022 as the reference year to monitor progress and assess 
advancements moving forward.
The Board of Directors recognises the importance of 
c
ommitting capital expenditure towards environmentally 
responsible practices that contribute to the Group's long-
term sustainability goals. Consequently, a budget of 
€5.23 million has been approved for 2024 to cover a 
range of sustainability investments in the operating assets. 
These investments include the 
certification of the portfolio 
(BREEAM) and the implementa
tion of recommended
measures, adaptation and expansion of the Building 
Management S
ystem (BMS) alongside smart metering, 
improvement of Energy Performance Certificate levels to 
tar
get A/B ratings, monitoring of CO2 emissions and air 
quality
, enhancement of waste and water management 
processes, energy efficiency initiatives, improving 
c
ustomer service and sustainable mobility options, and 
the enhancement of green areas and biodiversity.

Data collection and reporting process
The Group uses an online data collection platform 
(Deepki) c
overing its entire reporting scope, aimed at 
automating and improving the reliability and quality of 
the data. The tool was selected for its ability to enable 
smoother monitoring and reporting. Consumption data 
for energy, waste and water is collected on a monthly 
basis at asset level, 
verified and analysed at corporate 
le
vel. An annual report on the data, key insights, lessons 
learned, and the main investments required to meet 
annual targets is compiled under the supervision of 
the Group Head of Sustainability and presented to the 
Sustainability Committee.
Assets certification
The Company is committed to enhancing the 
sus
tainability performance of its buildings from both 
a structural and operational standpoint. This can be 
achieved by evaluating and certifying the buildings 
sustainability based on BREEAM methodology, covering 
various aspects such as climate change, energy and 
water use, health and well-being, pollution, transportation, 
materials, waste management, ecology and biodiversity, 
management processes.
As of 
19 March 2024, 97% of the eligible portfolio was 
BREEAM certified (strip malls and industrial assets have 
been e
xcluded) and the Group is committed to continue 
the certification of its eligible portfolio in the following 
years. The excluded buildings, i.e. industrial and strip 
centers, not prioritised for 
certification by the Group due 
t
o their low materiality, represent approximately 3% of the 
total portfolio by GLA. The BREEAM New Construction 
Certification was initiated for the shopping centers in the 
de
velopment pipeline.

Energy management
Real estate assets require significant energy for their 
de
velopment and operations, which makes energy 
management a relevant industry issue. The energy is 
needed for asset’s heating, ventilating, air conditioning, 
water heating, lighting, equipment, and represents a 
significant
 operating cost. Recent energy pricing volatility, 
as well as emergent energy regulations, have showcased 
the importance of energy management.
Energy performance considerations need to be integrated 
int
o property investment analysis and at NEPI Rockcastle 
these are part of the technical due diligence in 
operations and during the acquisition process. Energy 
efficiency improvements and related capital investment 
ar
e also a crucial part of the operational strategy. 
The Group continues to invest in innovative ways to 
reduce energy use and this is done by collaboration 
between the property management and sustainability 
departments who collectively identify opportunities for 
energy intensity reduction.
In 2023, the Company revised its targets in line with SBTi 
and as a r
esult, one of the targets is related to energy 
intensity reduction, as detailed on page 164.

In 2023, NEPI Rockcastle achieved 3% absolute reduction 
in ener
gy consumption compared to the previous year. 
The Property Management department has continued to 
deploy best practices and know-how across the portfolio 
to improve energy performance. Locally, the on-site teams 
achieved reduction of gas (reported as fuel), district 
heating, cooling and electricity consumption through 
various measures, i.e. by adjusting indoor temperatures 
to reduce the need for air conditioning or heating. The 
transition from traditional lighting to LED that began in 
2018 continued to be prioritised in 2023, consequently 
LED lights covered 91% of the common areas by year 
end. Installation of occupancy lighting controls and 
sensors in the technical areas and parking as well as low-
temperature water systems in restrooms continued.
In 2023, investments totalling €4.4 million were allocated 
t
o various sustainability initiatives. These included the 
installation of green roofs, occupancy and illumination 
sensors utilising external light sources, implementation 
of smart meters to facilitate efficient data collection, 
o
verall enhancements in building infrastructure (including 
initiatives recommended following BREEAM certification),  
application of special foil on glass façades and roofs 
t
o mitigate overheating, replacement of revolving doors 
to improve airtightness, upgrades to LED lighting and 
HVAC equipment, implementation of energy recovery 
systems, and installation of motion sensors in escalators 
and elevators.
The Company focused on exploring the use of 
artificial 
intelligence, by piloting projects in two assets: Karolinka 
Shopping C
entre in Opole, Poland, and Aupark Zilina, 
Slovakia. This marked the first implementation of robust 
c
ontrol mechanisms and automated equipment usage, 
based on integration of IoT technology into the Building 
Management Systems. Following promising results, the 
Company plans to expand this feature to nine assets in 
Poland and one in Croatia in 2024, with further extension 
across the portfolio starting 2025.
NEPI Rockcastle maintains in 2024 and beyond its 
c
ommitment to furthering energy efficiency  initiatives in 
order to achieve decarbonisation targets.
Sustainable resources management
With a clear vision of improving the long-term 
sus
tainability in its operations, the Group continued to 
invest in the sustainable development of its portfolio, 
in clean and sustainable technologies, adopted policies 
that address environmental and social challenges, and 
engaged in more proactive stakeholder discussions.
Sustainable resource management prioritises use of 
r
esources in a way that meets current needs without 
compromising the ability of future generations to 
meet theirs. It emphasises conservation, efficiency  and 
minimising environmental impact to maintain long-term 
ecological balance.
The Group complies with environmental regulations and 
s
tandards, and regularly monitors its compliance with 
applicable legislation and norms. All properties operate in 
accordance with local environmental laws, and compliance 
is monitored and 
verified  by environmental protection 
agencies. NEPI Rockcastle encourages its partners to 
provide feedback, including reporting non-compliance or 
any potential environmental risks. During 2023, the Group 
has not faced environmental any non-compliance issues 
resulting in material fines.
In the real estate industry, the circular economy 
c
ontributes to the sustainable resource management and 
involves designing, developing, and managing buildings 
to minimise waste, while promoting reuse and prioritising 
use of sustainable materials. It aims to create a closed 
loop system where resources are reused or regenerated, 
reducing the environmental impact of construction and 
operations. One good example that the Group introduced 
in 2023, is the cooperation with BRDA and Cyrkl in Alfa 
Mall, Białystok, Poland, details described further below, in 
the Waste Management section, page 171.
Water management
NEPI Rockcastle properties are generally connected to the 
public w
ater and sewage networks. Water is consumed 
in the Group properties mainly by the food processors 
and through the use in restroom areas by visitors of the 
shopping centres. Prevention of waste of water, careful 
monitoring of consumption, leak detection and signalling, 
are the main measures integrated in the properties to 
address water 
efficiency and scarcity risks.
NEPI Rockcastle, responsible for water use in common 
ar
eas, has implemented measures to improve water 
use efficiency  and will continue actively managing 
this resource.

ess the water scarcity and drought risk through 
its water conservation program. This includes capturing 
rainwater for landscaping, installing automatic flush toilets 
and lo
w-temperature systems in restrooms, reducing at 
the same time energy consumption. Going forward, the 
Company is also considering measures such as reusing 
grey water, improving irrigation systems and rainwater 
retention on the site, as well as using plants that have low 
watering needs.
The Group has set a target in 2019 to decrease water 
c
onsumption by 15% by the end of 2024 and plans to 
revise this target during 2024, based on analysis of the 
data available, efficiency of measures put in place and 
results up to date.
Complementary to water consumption management, 
another aspect addr
essed by NEPI Rockcastle is the 
management of the impact of water discharge. NEPI 
Rockcastle operations are non-industrial and therefore 
the volume of water consumed may be considered equal 
to the volume of water discharged, with a negligible 
difference
 for rainwater.
Rigorous implementation of the Environmental Policy at 
Gr
oup level includes regular maintenance programs, use 
of efficient equipment and strict internal procedures, to 
ensure that the properties are permanently in compliance 
with water quality regulations. The Group’s water 
discharge process is not considered a high-risk pollution 
factor, with all properties following the relevant laws 
and regulations. Due to a few cities technical restrictions 
on takeover capacity, some of the NEPI Rockcastle's 
properties are not connected to the public sewage 
system, therefore discharge used water into a natural 
stream. Strictly on and around these sites, biogenesis 
does not include any plant or animal species protected by 
the current regulations. In these locations, the wastewater 
is discharged after being treated in on-site wastewater 
plants, under the supervision of environmental authorities. 
The Group takes responsibility and minimises as much 
as possible the 
effects of its activities, by regularly 
monitoring the water quality, both before reaching the 
plant and after treatment, before discharge.
Waste Management
As a manager and developer of shopping centers, the 
r
egular business activities result in using a significant 
quantity of resources and producing various types 
of w
aste (both in the common and tenants’ areas). 
The Group resource-use targets are designed to focus 
attention on reducing waste both directly, through 
the management of waste generated in the assets, 
and indirectly, through the engagement with partners 
within the value chain. NEPI Rockcastle is committed 
to contributing to a circular economy and encourages 
recycling in order to reduce the amount of avoidable 
waste going to landfill.
The Group has 
defined its zero-avoidable waste to landfill 
plan, and is applying strict selective collection procedures, 
cr
eating efficient flows to increase the share of recyclable 
w
aste, modernising waste sorting areas while promoting 
environmentally responsible behaviour, educating tenants 
and visit
ors through concerted campaigns. The Group 
continuously engages with tenants and business partners 
to encourage them to join in this initiative, build 
awareness and boost support.
Key activities focused on installation of selective waste 
disposal bins, bringing in further elements tha
t help to 
divert waste from landfill and ensuring higher recycling 
rates. The Company successfully completed a pilot for 
a measuring system, to better track and analyse waste 
generated by tenants and visitors. The program has been 
implemented in 15 assets in Romania and will be extended 
further to all Romanian properties during 2024.
City Park, Constanta, Romania, together with Constanta 
R
estart, Act for Tomorrow, Zoom Beach NGOs and 
over 300 volunteers, launched an initiative to clean the 
nearby beach. This resulted in the collection of 6,500 
kg of waste (plastic bottles, metal cans, plastic straws, 
cups, cigarettes, paper). The mall developed a dedicated 
recycling project with Neversea (the biggest music festival 
on the Romanian seaside). More than 5,500 empty plastic 
bottles were collected based on a mechanism where for 
every empty bottle returned, a fresh bottle of water would 
be 
offered. The main purpose, besides cleaning the nature, 
was to educate people and make them aware of the 
damage waste can cause to the environment in the long-
term. Three schools and one local University attended this 
year’s edition.
In 14 Polish assets, NEPI Rockcastle organised a campaign 
dedica
ted to upcycling. During the workshops, 3,000 
bags were created from 1,000m2 advertising banners. 
Pla
tan Shopping Centre, Zabrze, and Focus Mall Piotrkow 
Trybunalski, in Poland, introduced waste disposal bins 
for small electronics. In Alfa, Bialystok, Poland, the team 
engaged the Cyrkl and BRDA NGO who organised a 
collection by 14 other local NGOs of waste from 
fit out 
works. In total, 1.7t of materials were diverted from landfill 
and given to charitable organisations to reuse.
NEPI Rockcastle's "Waste Responsible" campaign was 
held in se
veral shopping centers across Poland, including 
Aura Centrum, Alfa Centrum Bialystok, Galeria Wolomin, 
Galeria Tomaszow, Focus Mall Piotrkow Trybunalski, 
Solaris Shopping Centre, and Forum Gdansk Shopping 
Center. In collaboration with local waste management 
facilities and companies, engaging activities and 
educational demonstrations were organised to educate 
customers and tenants on their shared responsibilities 
in waste management. The initiative aimed to change 
consumer habits, encouraging the treatment of waste 
as recyclable materials. Educational games showcased 
waste segregation practices and the operation of waste 
collection chambers. Additionally, customers participated 
in electro-waste collection, receiving a plant in return. The 
campaign attracted almost 5,000 people and resulted in 
collection of over 2 tonnes of electro-waste.
NEPI Rockcastle has prepared a movie with instructions 
ho
w to sort waste for one of its Polish assets and plans 
to share it with the tenants, as a pilot for the waste 
management enactment program.

Portfolio decarbonisation
Carbon reduction approach
Real estate industry generates a significant carbon 
f
ootprint, both during asset construction and in operation, 
therefore, reducing GHG emissions is one of the key focus 
areas in NEPI Rockcastle’s strategy. A carbon reduction 
pathway has been established for the Group and is 
endorsed by the Board, encompassing development 
and redevelopment, operations, engagement with key 
stakeholders, management of own offices and employees 
busines
s travel. In 2023, the Company committed to align 
its key targets with Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), 
therefore focused on the calculation of extended Scope 
3 GHG emissions and on redefining the decarbonisation 
targets. The Company submitted its targets in December 
2023 and is expecting to have them validated and 
included in the revised strategy in Q1 2024. The detailed 
targets are described in the Pillar 1 Overview section, 
page 
163.
The carbon pathway outlines how NEPI Rockcastle 
int
ends to reach its climate goals of reducing operations 
carbon footprint by 2030:
• for scope 1 and 2, by 80%, compared to 2019
• for scope 3 in categories 3 and 13, by 25% compared 
t
o 2022
As development of new assets plays an important part 
in the Gr
oup’s strategy, embedded carbon is set to be 
reduced by 30% by 2030.
The targets will be achieved by shifting to lower-emission 
ener
gy sources including to on-site renewable energy 
production and by reducing gas and district heating 
consumption. The on-site renewable energy production 
contributes significantly to the Group’s sustainability 
targets to reduce its carbon footprint.
In 2023, the Group decreased its carbon footprint in 
oper
ations (scope 1, 2 and 3) by 19% compared to 
2022, based on the 11% increase in the renewable energy 
share and reduction of electricity and district heating 
consumption across its portfolio.
The Group uses the GHG protocol to track emissions and 
calc
ulation factors provided in the Measurabl platform 
(until June 2023) and Deepki platform (starting July 
2023). It allocates in Scope 1 gas consumption, in 
Scope 2 electricity, heating and cooling for common 
areas and in Scope 3, the energy consumed by tenants. 
Besides the emissions already included in scope 3, NEPI 
Rockcastle discharges gas emissions generated by the 
HVAC equipment in its properties. Equipment is regularly 
checked, and such emissions are kept under control and 
verified
 according to the law, while non-compliance with 
maximum thresholds has not been reported. The Group is 
committed to investing in new technologies that minimise 
negative impact on the environment.

Employing a comprehensive methodology during the 
SB
Ti target setting process, the Group has calculated 
9 categories of Scope 3 emissions, related to upstream 
and downstream activities for 2022, in line with the 
GHG Protocol. The calculation validated that the most 
important source of emissions in Scope 3 are downstream 
leased assets (category 13) which constitute almost 
47,30% of Scope 3 emissions. The second-largest emission 
sources are emissions stemming from capital expenditure 
(category 2) and emissions related to fuel and energy 
related activities (category 3), which make up to 24,86% 
and 21,33% respectively. Purchased goods and services 
(category 1) and waste generated in operations (category 
5) constitute 3,80% and 2,46% respectively, of Scope 3 
emissions. The remaining categories are not material, as 
they contribute to less than 0,30% of the emissions.

NEPI Rockcastle continues to apply the Carbon Risk Real 
Es
tate Monitor methodology and tool to monitor and 
adjust its portfolio alignment with the Paris Agreement 
and assess carbon-related risks. The tool provides the 
real estate industry with transparent science-based 
decarbonisation pathways, is used by the Group to 
identify assets at risk of becoming stranded and was key 
in prioritising decarbonisation efforts and investment. The 
as
set-level analysis helps the Group better identify and 
financially prioritise its short- to medium- to long-term 
decarbonisa
tion actions, to align with the decarbonisation 
pathway. The Group identified as a major challenge the 
disc
ontinuation of gas use in the assets, as well as limiting 
the emissions generated from district heating based on 
fossil fuels. Mitigation measures such as investing into own 
production of energy from renewable sources or potential 
entering into PPAs (power purchase agreements) are in 
short- to medium-term focus.
In 2024 the Company plans to prioritise efforts that 
will impr
ove energy efficiency and reduce emissions, 
enabling the achievement of the decarbonisation targets 
and ensuring alignment with EU Taxonomy.
Renewable electricity production 
and pur
chase
The onsite renewable photovoltaic installations continued 
t
o be a valuable initiative on the NEPI Rockcastle’s 
pathway to reach Net Zero. The Group progressed in the 
journey started in 2022 in Romania, when it has invested 
€3.9 million and rolled out photovoltaic panels in 10 
assets. In 2023, the Group further invested €30 million 
into on-site renewable electricity production. As a result, 
27 assets are equipped to produce renewable electricity, 
with one more to be completed in 2024.
Annual Report 2023 17 3

Sus tainability report
The cumulative capacity will ensure an installed power of 
up t
o 40 MW, covering 25-30% of the total energy used 
in the respective assets. The total investment is estimated 
at €37 million and is expected to significantly reduce 
the as
sets’ carbon footprint, reduce costs for traditional 
energy, enable energy-independence, prepare the assets 
be resilient in front of future regulations and changes 
in the energy markets. The Group has also installed 
photovoltaic panels in Ozas, Lithuania, with a production 
capacity of 480 kWh, estimated to cover up to 10% of the 
electricity need for the common area and analyses further 
expansion by 2.5 MWh in 2024.
The Group has accelerated its transition towards sourcing 
electricity fr
om renewable sources (“green electricity”), as 
certified based on the mechanism of Guarantees of Origin, 
defined by the 2009/28/ EC European Directive.

sustainable development and environmental protection 
includes photovoltaic panels installed on the building roof 
and car park, with the capacity to produce in total 5.7 
MW and to generate 5,701 MWh/year. This will cover 40% 
of electricity needs of the building, resulting in a carbon 
footprint reduction of 1,214.36 tons CO 2 /year.
Stimulate sustainable mobility
As part of the sustainability strategy and its 
decarbonisa
tion initiative, NEPI Rockcastle aims to 
address indirect emissions from transportation and
is therefore setting a long-term vision on the evolution of 
mobility tr
ends.
To promote low-emission sustainable mobility, the Group, 
in partnership with Enel and T
esla, has developed a 
network of electric car charging stations in Romania, 
Bulgaria and Poland. Part of this network, Tesla opened 
its biggest hub in Poland in Bonarka City Center, Kraków. 
In 2023, the Company conducted a feasibility review 
aimed at evaluating the installation of its own car 
charging stations.
The Group is making sure that the assets are well 
c
onnected to the public transportation network and 
all future development plans are evaluating proximity 
to public transportation. 88% of the Group’s standing 
asset portfolio (excluding industrial), is connected to 
public transportation within a reasonable distance. NEPI 
Rockcastle is committed to improving the on-site facilities 
for bike parking and bike repair stations, promote car-
sharing solutions and adapt to innovations like electric 
bike charging stations.

Climate change adaptation
Climate change impacts the real estate industry through 
fr
equent or severe extreme weather events and long-term 
climate shifts. These events can directly damage assets, 
requiring costly mitigation and increasing insurance costs. 
Although long-term climate shifts may not directly affect 
asset integrity, they can disrupt building operations and 
r
aise operating costs. Heat stress, particularly in non-
airconditioned or outdoor areas, can impair both physical 
and mental performance. Climate-related risks can impact 
asset valuation, requiring significant adaptation and 
in
vestment, therefore developing and implementing a 
comprehensive climate change adaptation strategy is 
crucial for long-term value creation.
NEPI Rockcastle is undertaking climate change adaptation 
measur
es to increase the climate resilience of its 
properties. An overarching climate change adaptation 
plan was prepared in 2023 for the entire portfolio, and 
dedicated plans at property level are to be completed 
in 2024 – 2025 period. Adaptation measures include 
installing cooling systems suitable for future needs, 
implementing passive cooling methods, increasing green 
area coverage, and installing green roofs or walls. 
Additionally, measures such as designing raised 
first 
floors, using flood-resistant materials, installing technical 
equipment on higher floors, implementing fire-resistant 
materials and alarm systems, and rainwater collection 
s
ystems, address the risks of extreme weather events. 
Flood risk assessments are conducted for each property 
as part of BREEAM assessment and fire emergency action 
plans are developed.
Biodiversity and ecology 
NEPI Rockcastle is committed to a unified approach 
to conserving and enhancing biodiversity, mitigating 
negative impacts near its assets. Environmental due 
diligence is integrated into property acquisition decisions, 
while environmental permits are obtained and materially 
complied with in the construction process, in line with 
applicable laws.
The Group is committed to retaining and improving the 
biodiv
ersity around the assets and its local communities. 
NEPI Rockcastle will develop a Biodiversity Strategy by 
2025 based on the TNFD (The Taskforce on Nature-
Related Financial Disclosures) methodology, and will set 
specific
 targets and objectives for each asset. In 2023, 
the Group initiated the development of this strategy by 
conducting a biodiversity-related hazard assessment. As 
nature-related dependencies and impacts are location 
specific,
 the Group has identified relevant risks for each 
of its asset.
The biodiversity risk assessment was performed using 
W
WF Biodiversity Risk Filter, a tool recommended in 
TNFD guidance. As a result, the Group captured the 
biodiversity risk matrix for its entire portfolio, as a 
baseline in the development of its strategy.
To ensure the strategy is science-based and effective 
in mitigating potential impacts on nature, the 
Gr
oup will consult with biodiversity and ecology 
experts, including conservation groups, governmental 
or
ganisations, research institutions. On-site biodiversity 
assessments will inform action plans to improve or 
enhance local ecosystems.
Creation of urban meadows and green spaces such as 
gr
een roofs and green walls will be considered, as part 
of the strategy. Some of the assets have already installed 
hotels for insects, birdhouses or hedgehog boxes as 
well as apiaries, to promote local biodiversity, and such 
initiatives will continue 2024 onwards.
The onsite teams ensure that biodiversity is well managed 
and monit
ored during day-to-day operations, while the 
sustainability team monitors the application of the 
biodiversity policy and strategy and provides the local 
teams with the necessary support.
Sustainable construction management 
The development of buildings consumes significant 
resources and can have a major impact on the 
en
vironment. To address these environmental and 
climate concerns in a socially responsible manner and 
better manage the Company’s impact, NEPI Rockcastle 
has defined a Sustainable Development Policy. The 
polic
y references best practices such as improved 
operational energy efficiency and installation of renewable 
sour
ces of energy, lower embodied carbon, circular 
economy principles, biodiversity protection. A Sustainable 
Development Minimum Standard is under preparation, 
under the Sustainable Development Policy umbrella and 
both documents will be implemented into the design and 
construction process in 2024.
The Sustainable Development Minimum Standard (SDMS) 
describes in detail the r
equirements that new buildings 
must meet in the following areas of impact:
• Green certification
• Sustainable design
• Physical climate risk and climate adaptation
• EU Taxonomy alignment
• Energy efficiency
• Net zero carbon and GHG emissions
• Low/zero carbon technologies
• Pollution
• Sustainable procurement
• Sustainable materials
• Circular economy design
• Waste Management
• Water Management
• Biodiversity and habitat
• Transportation
• Health and wellbeing
• Social risk assessment
• Safe and responsible construction practices
Design optimisation is a crucial aspect in reducing 
c
onstruction and demolition waste, therefore designers 
must work closely together during the design stage, 
towards waste minimisation. Most of the construction 
contracts are ‘design and build’, therefore contractors 
176 NEPI R
 ockcastle N.V.

Page 177:

are responsible end to end of the site operations. Each 
c
ontractor is responsible for waste management, so there 
is an intrinsic focus on recycling, minimisation, and sorting 
of waste. Communication with tenants during the fit-out 
design stage is important, to allow early agreement on 
la
youts and minimise repeated modifications, demolition, 
and w
aste.
The SDMS aims to ensure that each new built asset 
within NEPI R
ockcastle portfolio is complying with 
relevant regulations and internationally recognised best-
practice frameworks such as the EU Taxonomy, TCFD 
or TNFD, while also aiming to contribute to reaching 
NEPI Rockcastle’s decarbonisation strategy and strategic 
objectives defined by the Group.

all jurisdictions. The Risk and Compliance Committee 
ensures continuous operational compliance, focusing 
on fire safety, hygiene, environmental safety permits 
and authorisa
tions.
The property management team proactively maintains 
high health and saf
ety standards, conducting regular 
assessments of air and water quality, asbestos, air 
pollution, Legionnaire’s disease risks, and the maintenance 
of technical, safety, and fire extinguishing systems. This 
includes v
entilation cleaning, HVAC and fire system 
repairs, and thorough building inspections. Remote CCTV 
monitoring, specialised security services for each asset, 
and the consideration of a round-the-clock designated 
fireman
 role are all measures to enhance safety. Regular 
evacuation drills, mandatory antiterrorism procedures for 
security staff, and safety protocols for tenants during fit-
out works reinforce the Group’s commitment to safety.

Security measures extend to protecting sensitive 
ar
eas like management offices and technical rooms, 
alongside the maint
enance of CCTV systems. The Group 
collaborates with local emergency services and provides 
24/7 access to critical documents and systems to 
ensure preparedness for emergencies. Training programs, 
conducted by external safety specialists, focus on the 
security environment of the shopping centers and 
operational procedures, guaranteeing adherence to legal 
and best safety practices.
Visitors and communities
Knowing our customer
NEPI Rockcastle expanded its Marketing department in 
20
22 to leverage its regional presence for enhanced 
consumer insight, mall positioning, and go-to-market 
efforts. The department established a three-pillar regional 
mark
eting structure, enabling a consistent approach to 
understanding consumers, and creating synergies for 
effective
 shopper engagement.
In 2023, NEPI Rockcastle conducted customer satisfaction 
surv
eys across all the Group's operational assets in nine 
countries. These surveys utilised the same methodology in 
each country, aiming to gather information on
various aspects, including consumer habits when visiting 
shopping malls, c
onsumer groups or motivational 
segments, the consumer perception of NEPI Rockcastle’s 
malls (including the Net Promoter Score) compared to 
competitors, the awareness and use of NEPI Rockcastle’s 
digital engagement platforms.
These studies were instrumental in categorising the 
Gr
oup’s assets into three clusters, thereby facilitating the 
sharing of best practices across multiple malls to better 
serve consumers.
The long-term sustainable value of customer engagement 
surv
eys lies in the creation of a positive experience and 
brand reputation, which are critical for the success and 
longevity of a business. These surveys provide valuable 
insights into consumer preferences, behaviours, and 
needs, which are used to optimise the shopping center’s 
offerings,
 services, and improve customer satisfaction. 
The outcome enables NEPI Rockcastle to identify areas 
for improvement and implement corrective measures 
to address customer complaints, ultimately leading to 
enhanced customer loyalty and retention. Additionally, 
they allow the Group to assess the 
effectiveness 
of marketing, and community engagement campaigns, 
ther
eby making data-driven decisions to better approach 
consumers and address communities needs.

Additionally, in November 2023, the Company conducted 
its inaugur
al Sustainability Perception study across 14 
assets in Romania. The survey was tailored to explore key 
sustainability issues that are top-of-mind for Romanian 
shoppers. The findings revealed that 75% of Romanians 
consider sustainability a major concern, with the highest 
level of interest found among individuals aged 35–
45, of whom 7
9% consider sustainability significant. 
Deforestation emerged as the primary concern voiced 
b
y respondents. For further insights, refer to the 
infographic below.
The Group intends to extend this research methodology 
in 20
24 to identify the most relevant sustainability topics 
across countries.
This initiative aims to shape the strategic direction of 
sus
tainability efforts and better serve the communities in 
which the Group operates.

Social media and digital presence
The Group's Corporate LinkedIn page serves as a platform 
f
or maintaining a strong digital presence and engaging 
with external stakeholders and peers. Audience expanded 
from 7,000 at the beginning of 2023 to 10,000 by 
December 2023. Content shared on LinkedIn includes 
updates on operational and developmental activities, with 
a focus on sharing best practices and news related to 
sustainability initiatives, all under 
#responsibletogether 
and #strongertogether.
Moreover, the Group is committed to providing visitors 
with the highes
t standard of service in its assets. Various 
measures are in place to ensure customer satisfaction, 
including addressing questions and inquiries on social 
networks and supporting customers with their most 
frequent requests. NEPI Rockcastle has introduced two 
applications, SPOT and sAPPort, to facilitate easy access 
to all solutions offered
 in the assets.
SPOT is a mobile application-based loyalty program 
utilising OCR t
echnology, designed to foster long-term 
relationships and engagement with customers visiting 
the Group's assets. It incentivises users to increase 
the frequency and value of their purchases by offering 
attractive prizes and unique benefits.
sAPPort is a mobile application implemented to enable 
pr
oviding various services and facilities for customers, 
including technical assistance, services for parents 
with children and for seniors, thereby enhancing 
visitors’ experience.

Communities Engagement
As a leading investor and developer of commercial real 
es
tate in the CEE, NEPI Rockcastle holds the responsibility 
to drive positive change towards a healthier, more 
sustainable, and prosperous future for both visitors and 
local communities.
A key focus of the Group's sustainability strategy is 
t
o create sustainable commercial spaces that prioritise 
decarbonisation, energy efficiency, circular economy
principles, biodiversity preservation, and renewable 
ener
gy adoption, while also supporting local economies, 
fostering sustainable lifestyle, and raising awareness 
among visitors.
Strategic, long-term partnerships with local and global 
or
ganisations play a crucial role in understanding 
community needs, identifying shared priorities, and 
coordinating efforts to achieve meaningful outcomes. 
The Group supports local charities and non-governmental 
organisations (NGOs) that contribute to the holistic 
development of communities.
Under the #responsibletogether
 platform, the umbrella 
for the Group's social responsibility initiatives, NEPI 
Rockcastle continued to implement a diverse range of 
projects in 2023, aligning with its community engagement 
strategy across three directions: health, education, 
and environment.

Provide education to build a better future
NEPI Rockcastle firmly believes that education is the 
key to creating a better world and is committed to 
investing in educational programs for children, parents 
and senior members of the communities. In 2023, 
the Company's commitment to investing in educational 
initiatives underscored its dedication to building stronger 
communities. Recognising the importance of tailored 
education, NEPI Rockcastle aligned its programs with 
the specific needs of local communities, covering diverse 
fields
 such as science, parenting, technology, road safety, 
and cultural preservation.
Throughout the year, the Company has organised 
educa
tional projects in 80% of the shopping centres, 
with a primary focus on Romania, Slovakia, and Poland. 
Notably, the "Empty Classroom" initiative in Romania 
marked its third year, aiming to provide underprivileged 
children with access to well-equipped libraries, promoting 
love for reading and learning. Collaborating with World 
Vision Romania, we hosted a series of engaging events 
featuring music, film, and journalism, complemented by 
the dis
tribution of audio books and school supplies across 
12 shopping centers. As a result, over 16,000 children 
and 1,400 teachers from 41 schools across 23 counties 
benefited from this endeavour.
Additionally, NEPI Rockcastle supported Educational Fairs 
in o
ver 10 shopping centres in Romania, offering children 
valuable insights into future career opportunities.

Promoting health and safety initiatives in 
the c
ommunities
In 2023, NEPI Rockcastle prioritised health education, 
launching scalable pr
ojects aimed at addressing 
community health needs, from prevention to intervention. 
These initiatives were designed to support the growth 
and development of the communities where the 
Company operates. By fostering well-informed and 
connected communities, NEPI Rockcastle facilitated 
sustainable engagement, working collaboratively to 
empower communities and to promote responsible and 
active societal engagement. Health-focused campaigns 
were conducted in more than 90% of the shopping 
centers across all 9 countries.
Blood donation awareness campaigns were a significant 
focus, conducted in partnership with various NGOs, 
including the R
ed Cross. Free health examinations, 
including blood pressure and glucose level measurements, 
as well as first aid trainings were organised in nearly 
all shopping c
enters. Notably, Shopping City Timisoara 
and Shopping City Sibiu saw substantial participation in 
initiatives such as blood glucose level measurement and 
cancer prevention campaigns.
Mental health initiatives were also prioritised, with a 
f
ocus on wellbeing and support for specific mental health 
disor
ders. Collaborating with local authorities and NGOs, 
NEPI Rockcastle launched projects such as the Mammut 
Help Point in Budapest, Hungary, and the Life Plan 
Academy in Poland. These initiatives aimed to provide free 
mental health guidance and workshops to enhance the 
mental resilience of young people.
NEPI Rockcastle promoted inclusivity and accessibility 
f
or individuals with disabilities. Projects such as the 
STEP-HEAR orientation system at City Park in Constanta, 
Romania, and the implementation of "Quiet Hours" 
at various locations in Poland and in Lithuania, 
demonstrated the Company's commitment to creating 
inclusive environments.
In 2022, Copernicus Shopping Centre, a property from 
P
oland, underwent the audit 'Building with No Barriers', 
to obtain certification demonstrating its readiness 
to accommodate visitors with disabilities. Following 
the audit, various enhancements were 
identified and 
implemented throughout 2023. These included adapting 
toilets for people with disabilities by adjusting handrails, 
installing tilting mirrors, and incorporating an alarm 
system connected to the center's security monitoring. 
Additionally, improvements were made to the food 
court elevator, with the installation of a voice message 
system and Braille markings. External stairs were also 
enhanced with the addition of barriers and ramps to 
ensure accessibility, including a dedicated ramp for 
smaller strollers. These 
efforts reflect NEPI Rockcastle's 
c
ommitment to fostering inclusive environments across 
its properties.
In line with our commitment to sustainability, all Polish 
as
sets were equipped with the "Airly" system in 2023, 
measuring air quality parameters to combat pollution 
effectively. Investments in nanotechnology air filtration 
systems further exemplify dedication to ensuring cleaner 
and healthier en
vironments across our properties.

Promoting local economies and employment 
opportunities within c
ommunities
NEPI Rockcastle prioritises the development of resilient 
and sus
tainable local economies to foster community 
well-being. Recognising the significance of shopping 
c
enters as catalysts for local economic growth, the 
Group evaluates the long-term benefits of its assets' 
oper
ations on local communities. These benefits include 
the creation of both direct and indirect employment 
opportunities, generating tax revenue for local authorities, 
and stimulating economic activity. Moreover, by adopting 
a holistic approach that addresses the social and 
economic dimensions in the operations and during the 
development, the Group contributes to the sustainable 
growth potential of surrounding regions.
In line with its commitment to promoting local 
emplo
yment, NEPI Rockcastle ensures that its operations 
across all countries prioritise hiring local personnel, even 
during the tendering process for new services.
Promoting environmental awareness 
and educa
tion
NEPI Rockcastle places a strong emphasis on 
en
vironmental resilience and education, employing 
innovative practices to foster positive impacts within 
local communities. Since 2017, Promenada Bucharest in 
Romania has been hosting the Green Tech Film Festival, 
the country's pioneering event of its kind. This festival 
combines exhibitions showcasing green technologies, 
conferences featuring sustainability pioneers, and a 
curated selection of documentaries on green technology. 
The 2023 edition featured an interactive space for 
both children and parents, offering eco-entertainment 
and sus
tainable activities driven by artificial intelligence, 
ac
cess to documentaries focusing on recycling and 
nature conservation, and a sustainable exhibition crafted 
from cans. With over 400 participants, the festival 
aimed to raise awareness and engagement regarding the 
importance of sustainability and environmental protection.
The Waste Responsible action took place in 14 shopping 
c
enters across Poland, aiming to educate customers 
about responsible consumption and production. Further 
details on this event can be found under pillar 1, Waste 
Management approach, on page 171.
We Rework Upcycling Workshops were organised in all 
14 P
olish centers, where customers crafted bags and 
accessories from recycled materials. Participants engaged 
in sewing reusable, fashionable shopper bags using former 
advertising banners from the centers. The workshops also 
provided education on circularity, upcycling, and zero 
waste. Tenants joined the campaign by donating their 
banners. Through this initiative, approximately 1,000m2 
of former banners were transformed into nearly 3,000 
shopping bags, pr
omoting the message that waste can be 
repurposed into practical and reusable products.
In 2023, the second edition of The Circular Guide was 
launched t
o promote the idea of a circular economy.
This publication highlights specific examples of 
sus
tainable living choices that support a circular economy, 
emphasising product composition, manufacturing 
processes, eco-design, and innovative recycling solutions. 
NEPI Rockcastle aims to educate customers about 
the circular economy and encourage responsible 
purchasing decisions through this guide, which was made 
available during Circular Week and promoted through 
various channels.
Mega Mall in Bucharest, Romania, introduced the Museum 
of Clima
te Changes in collaboration with Act for 
Tomorrow, an NGO focused on educating children on 
sustainability. Over 9,000 children visited the museum 
within one month, prompting the local government and 
ministries to propose NEPI Rockcastle as a partner in 
creating a national movement to raise awareness about 
climate change and environmental education.
The summer campaign organised by Arena Centar 
in Zagr
eb, Croatia, focused on eco-awareness and 
environmental consciousness. The event featured a beach 
setup, including a whale made of recycled bottles, and 
an area dedicated to waste and recycling. Plastic bottles 
collected during the event were repurposed to create 
Christmas decorations.
Sponsorships and donations
NEPI Rockcastle is a supporter and promoter of the 
c
ultural heritage in its countries, and supports prime 
art and culture initiatives, complementary to its three 
strategic directions in the CSR strategy.
Along these lines, the Group brought its contribution 
in or
ganising two landmark art exhibitions honouring 
Picasso and Constantin Brancusi in Romania.
Recognising the cultural and educational impact, 
NEPI R
ockcastle displayed in three Romanian malls 
art-work inspired by Picasso, where over 630,000 
people experienced the artist’s world and learned 
about contemporary Romanian artists influenced
 by 
his movement.
In relation to Constantin Brancusi, one of the most 
r
emarkable Romanian artists, the Group was one of the 
sponsors of the Brancusi Exhibition. The exhibition, with 
massive national and international media coverage, was 
organised in Timisoara, one of the three European Capitals 
of Culture in 2023, and it attracted over 130,000 visitors.
NEPI Rockcastle formalised its Sponsorship Policy, 
c
ommitting not to support entities or projects that 
conflict with the Group's values, negatively impact 
the environment, health, or safety, promote tobacco 
or alcohol industries, endorse violence or terrorism, 
engage in unethical practices like money laundering or 
corruption, or support political parties, campaigns, or 
projects. While acknowledging its societal role, which 
may involve sponsorships and donations as part of 
responsible corporate citizenship, the Group explicitly 
excludes allocating support for political parties in any 
form, including payments, donations, sponsorships, or 
other in-kind 
benefits.

Sustainability in the value chain
Sustainable procurement practices
The Group intends to build partnerships with its suppliers, 
v
alues and encourages fair competitive practices, while 
promoting, where possible, local sourcing.
NEPI Rockcastle strongly believes in collaborating 
with partners sharing its v
alues, based on a win-win 
partnership governed by probity and integrity. These are 
covered in the Code of Ethics, Anti Money Laundering 
and Counterterrorism Policy, Sustainable Procurement 
Policy, Sustainability Commitment for NEPI Rockcastle’s 
Business Partners.
An overarching Compliance Statement has been published 
on the Gr
oup's corporate website - Compliance 
Statement, accessible to all stakeholders, summarising 
the main principles and rules defined in the Group's 
C
ompliance Framework.
The Sustainable Procurement Policy was designed to 
ensur
e that NEPI Rockcastle can positively inﬂuence 
its upstream value chain and that suppliers implement 
aligned sustainable principles in their line of business. The 
following principles of sustainable procurement are at the 
core of the policy:
• choosing products and services with a lower 
en
vironmental impact
• making sure that procurement is approached in an 
ethical manner
• reasonably reviewing that major suppliers are aware 
of and c
omply with key sustainability principles, in 
order to understand the impact of their products on 
environment and communities
• implementing new strategies to avoid unnecessary 
c
onsumption and proactively managing demand
• encouraging innovation in sustainable products 
and servic
es
Advocating responsible practices in the 
supply chain
Collaborating with more than 13,000 suppliers across its 
portf
olio, the Group is convinced that it can positively 
influence sustainability in its supply chain, based on 
concerted efforts.
The Group commits to influence business partners to 
join 
efforts and share similar ambitions around positive 
environmental impact, climate change mitigation, carbon 
footprint reduction, circularity, ethics, social responsibility, 
exemplary respect for human rights. The Sustainability 
Commitment for NEPI Rockcastle’s Business Partners 
is one step towards this ambitious target and is 
published on the corporate website, accessible to all 
business partners, 
NEPI Rockcastle Business Partner 
Sustainability commitment.
The Group implemented dedicated sustainability clauses 
in suppliers’ c
ontracts, whereas the supplier warrants that 
it observes the principles and values in the Sustainability 
Commitment and furthermore, that it will take necessary 
measures to ensure that its personnel, as well as its main 
subcontractors, suppliers and collaborators, are complying 
with such principles.
Starting 2022, the Group has implemented a tool 
(
Green Assessment Form) to assess suppliers’ practices 
and approach to sustainability, by evaluating key 
environmental, social and governance practices.
Annual Report 2023 185

Sus tainability report
In 2023, it prioritised a year-end review for selected 
k
ey suppliers across all jurisdictions and core operations 
(construction and asset management). In parallel, a similar 
assessment process was carried out as part of the 
suppliers selection and evaluation process organised on 
a regional level for concluding service agreements with 
strategic vendors in asset management.
Based on such assessment, suppliers are assigned one of 
‘Dark gr
een’, ‘Medium green’ or ‘Light green’ labels.
The shades of green labelling system categorises 
suppliers based on their sus
tainability practices, by rating 
their key environmental, human rights and governance 
practices. ‘Dark green’ 
signifies outstanding environmental 
and social responsibility, showcasing excellence and 
leadership. ‘Medium green’ denotes commitment to 
and reasonable performance in sustainability initiatives. 
‘Light green’ indicates a basic level of sustainability 
practices, serving as a starting point for environmental 
and social responsibility.
The Group aims to limit its interactions with ‘Light green’ 
suppliers, as w
ell as to promote and advocate greener 
practices among its ‘Medium green' suppliers.

Sustainability engagement with tenants
Real estate assets exert significant sustainability impacts 
through resource consumption, waste, and by influencing 
the well-being of the occupants. These impacts are 
oft
en a result of tenant activities, however, real estate 
owners have a crucial role in mitigating them. Proactive 
management can enhance asset value, boost tenant 
satisfaction and demand, reduce operating costs, and 
mitigate regulatory risks.
Scope 3 emissions are those that the Company is 
indir
ectly responsible for and has no full control over. 
As part of these, the emissions from downstream leasing 
activity are key in reducing the total emissions from 
operations. NEPI Rockcastle defined an SBTi-approved 
tar
get to reduce Scope 3 emissions associated with the 
tenant’s energy consumption by 25% until 2030 from 
2022 baseline.
In 2023, the emissions from downstream leasing activity 
amount
ed to 62,335 tCO2e, representing 76% of the 
Gr
oup’s reported emissions (market-based approach).
The Group progressed with implementing green clauses 
in the house rules and lease agr
eements, in all countries 
where it operates. Some core environmental clauses 
were already covered in the current lease agreements, 
while for others the Group has initiated discussions 
with key tenants, to identify common grounds regarding 
sustainability efforts. These covered:
• access to tenant-controlled utility data
• recommending operational parameters and 
perf
ormance targets for the tenants (for example 
HVAC set point/landlord override, installation of 
occupancy sensors and LEDs, auxiliary HVAC hours, 
prohibited use of volatile organic compounds)
• collaboration for obtaining the green buildings 
certification (for example recycling, green areas 
maint
enance, pest control)
• common effort to promote sustainable means 
of tr
ansportation
• integration of sustainability considerations into design 
and fit out
83% of the lease agreements in place across the Group 
ar
e currently covered by green clauses, either through 
the house rules or as part of the contract itself. 90% of 
the 1,307 leases concluded or extended during 2023 have 
been covered by green clauses.
Considering the notable contribution of Scope 3 
emis
sions to the overall Group’s carbon footprint, the 
Company also plans to implement a dedicated program 
to support the tenants improve their energy consumption.
Moreover, NEPI Rockcastle undertakes widespread 
educa
tion campaigns, awareness building activities and 
regular dialogue with the main tenants, aimed to align 
approach to sustainability performance and exchange 
ideas and experience. In the ‘Retail Days’ organised 
in 2023, where major retailers were invited, dialogue 
covered also major sustainability initiatives and best 
practices exchange.
The Group proactively engages with its tenants not 
only in t
erms of signing the green lease appendix, but 
also by encouraging and exchanging best practices on 
corporate level and promoting the adoption of science-
based targets for bigger Groups. NEPI Rockcastle noted 
that several international tenants have also set targets 
in accordance with SBTi methodology, including their 
commitment to collaborating with business partners 
and landlords who are on the same trajectory. The 
Group’s commitment to sustainability not only 
benefits 
the environment, but also enhances the resilience 
and c
ompetitiveness of its tenants and contributes to 
broader industry-wide transformation towards a more 
sustainable future.

The Group continued rolling out the sustainability strategy 
and prioritised its f
ocus on people and their integrity. 
For 2023 the Group has set specific targets to assess 
the Gr
oup’s adherence to the International Labour 
Organisation (ILO) policies and has derived specific action 
plans f
or 2024 and onwards, to ensure the best social 
standards are implemented and enforced.

Permanent
Ethical conduct
The Group undertakes to preserve ethical principles and 
c
onduct, build on robust governance, focus on promoting 
integrity as one of the Group’s core values.
The Group's continued success depends on employing 
highly qualified people and establishing a working 
environment free from discrimination, harassment, 
intimidation, or coercion based on race, religion, gender, 
age, nationality, or disability. Therefore, the Group 
employees are regularly coached to treat everyone fairly, 
to avoid unethical practices, to treat all persons with 
respect and consideration, to demonstrate integrity and 
honesty in order to inspire confidence and trust, both 
int
ernally and outside the Company.
The Group’s employees, operations and service providers 
ar
e based in different countries, however the fundamental 
c
onventions of the ILO are ratified and human rights 
standards are enforced by national and European 
regulations. In 2023, the Group carried out a due diligence 
assessment of the minimum safeguards in line with the 
EU Taxonomy.
The assessment focused on analysing the ILO principles 
and sus
tainability ratings requirements, in the context of 
the Group’s operating model (with a focus on workforce, 
own and in the supply chain).
The gaps were analysed, and the following risks 
w
ere prioritised:
• protection of employees personal data
• forced labour and overtime
• fair wages and working time
• freedom of association
All the above are already addressed through various 
measur
es implemented by the Company (for example 
data protection policy, employee internal regulations, 
employment contracts templates). To further formalise 
its commitment to protecting human rights, the Group 
prepared an ILO Umbrella Policy, published in the first 
quarter of 2024, meant to complement its already 
implement
ed Diversity and Inclusion Policy (that had, as 
well, been supplemented with further clarifications around 
the pr
actices in place at Group level so that to facilitate 
employee-level engagement). In relation to the supply 
chain, the Group concluded that the Business Partner 
Sustainability Commitment, the sustainability and health 
& safety clauses implemented in the supplier contract 
templates and the sustainability supplier assessment 
performed through the Green Assessment Form (as 
detailed in pillar two of this report), address the human 
rights risks associated with its suppliers practices.

Creating awareness on internal codes, policies 
and ethical s
tandards
The Group reviewed its Enterprise Risk Management and 
C
ompliance arrangements, in line with efforts to ensure a 
one siz
e fits all approach regarding risk assessment and 
mitigation at Group level. Areas relevant from an ESG 
perspective covered:
• training and awareness programmes for all staff, 
focusing mainly on prevention of corruption, 
gifts polic
y, whistleblowing rules, competition law 
requirements, business continuity essentials and 
conduct rules
• training and awareness program for senior 
management, Risk & C
ompliance partners and all 
staff, aiming to increase overall crisis risk culture, 
r
esponsiveness and adaptability to incidents and 
crisis management
• ensuring a more efficient and transparent sponsorship 
and donation process
• dedicated competition compliance program aiming to 
help c
ollaborators and employees identify sensitive, 
risk prone areas in their current activity
• Group-wide fraud and criminal corporate liability 
risk as
sessment
During 2023, the Group further developed and built 
a
wareness on the following, as part of its commitment to 
the highest ethical standards:
• Code of Ethics
• Whistleblowing Policy
• Compliance Policy
• Declaration of Interests Policy
• Risk Management Policy
• Sponsorship and Donations Procedure
• Group Procurement Procedure
• Competition law
The policies above address at length the company’s focus 
on int
egrity, avoidance of conflict-of-interests, anti-bribery 
and anti-c
orruption, compliance with gifts policy and 
defined monetary limits, transparent and ethical conduct. 
Periodical awareness and training campaigns throughout 
the year addressed, besides the above core priorities, also 
soft behaviour aspects such as: excellence, teamwork and 
communication, innovation and learning. Furthermore, the 
awareness campaigns reminded employees of all policies 
and procedures regulating the core business processes, 
with a focus on adequate segregation of duties, efficient 
risk management and controls processes.
As the Group places paramount importance on ethical 
beha
viour, same values are embedded in the 360-
feedback survey, part of the annual evaluation process. 
The core values are constantly reinforced by the Group's 
Executive Directors, translated into practice based on the 
'Tone from the Top' principle and embedded in various 
trainings, workshops, awareness campaigns, throughout 
the year.
The personnel is encouraged to disclose any potential 
conflict
 of interest, in the annual conflict of interest 
campaign, as w
ell as whenever such situation may 
occur. Disclosures are assessed by the Risk and 
Compliance Department, who also suggests adequate 
pr
eventive or mitigation measures so that to ensure that 
personal interests of employees do not conflict with 
Gr
oup’s interests.
Annually and whenever the case throughout the year, 
the Dir
ectors in the Board are also disclosing their 
potential conflicts of interest, as well as directorships and 
ownerships in other undertakings, with the aim to ensure 
transparency and independence are preserved.
Awareness and training campaigns covering all 
emplo
yees, key collaborators, tenants, and suppliers were 
organised during 2023, in all jurisdictions and resulted in a 
participation rate of 100%, both at Board of Directors and 
employee level.
The Risk and Compliance 
Officer and the Compliance 
function provide advice and guidance to all employees. 
Questions, grievances, potential risks or uncertainties may 
be directed through dedicated communication channels, 
to promote transparency and raise employees’ awareness, 
as well as provide advice, guidance and support. The 
requests for advice are treated 
confidentially, tracked 
and ans
wered in a timely manner. When it comes 
to sustainability compliance, the Risk and Compliance 
Officer
 supports the Group Head of Sustainability in 
setting the overall framework, in the risk assessment 
and prioritisation process, in the definition of training 
and awareness campaigns, as well as in embedding 
sustainability across business processes and overall 
enterprise risk management.
The Group has an open-door policy and supports a 
speak
-up culture. Employees are encouraged to share 
their concerns, suggestions or complaints with their line 
manager, Risk and Compliance, Internal Audit. To promote 
full transparency, as well as to provide a mechanism 
to report concerns, NEPI Rockcastle has implemented 
the Whistleblowing Policy, provided several convenient 
reporting channels, while guaranteeing non-retaliation 
and confidentiality. The reporting channels available to 
both emplo
yees and external parties, and allowing also 
anonymous reporting, are the following: online portal 
available on the Group’s corporate website and 24/7 
hotline reachable from all countries relevant to the Group 
in local language.
Both channels are monitored by an independent third-
party servic
e provider and each report is documented 
and submitted to the Chairman of the Board, Chair of the 
Audit Committee, Internal Audit Director, CFO and CEO.
The Company encourages the potential whistleblowers 
t
o disclose their identity by enforcing its non-
retaliation policy and guaranteeing confidentiality 
wherever reasonably possible. Even though disclosing 
the whis
tleblowers’ identity supports the efficiency and 
effectiveness of the investigation process, by allowing the 
investigation team to obtain clarifications, follow up, and 
provide information on the status of the investigation, 
complaints made anonymously are considered and 
analysed with the same degree of diligence.
The Whistleblowing Policy and reporting channels are 
c
ommunicated to all employees by the Risk and

vailable on the Group’s website. The Group received tip-
offs in 2023 from both inside and outside of the Company, 
in several jurisdictions, concerning specific operational 
ma
tters. The channels used by the whistleblowers were, 
in their order of use: the online portal, information/e-mail 
to Internal Audit, e-mail to Risk and Compliance. The 
tip-offs received, including types of alleged misconduct, 
procedures performed, conclusions and recommendations 
are categorised, traced, and reported periodically to the 
Audit Committee.
Based on the above, the Group considers the Code 
of Ethics as w
ell as all Compliance-related policies 
(as referenced and detailed in the beginning of this 
chapter) have been effectively
 implemented across all 
jurisdictions. No material breaches of these policies have 
been confirmed during 2023.

Report, page 104.

Diversity and inclusion
The Group supports the principles of gender diversity 
a
t Board level and throughout the company. With 601 
employees and over 11 nationalities, the Company focuses 
on fostering the growth and creativity with the unique 
offer provided by such a diverse group of people. The 
Group formalised its Diversity and Inclusion Policy in 
2022, in line with the Dutch legislation, covering its 
approach and commitment to diversity in the Board 
and all staff levels. In 2023 the approach to diversity 
w
as reviewed with the support of external advisors, to 
close any gaps and enable smoother implementation, 
effectiveness, and monitoring.
The main role of a diversity and inclusion policy is to 
cr
eate a workplace culture that respects all employees, 
regardless of their differences. The policy aims to support 
the s
tand the Group takes in relation to ensuring 
strong diversity practices and inclusive behaviour, further 
highlighting the commitment to build a strong workforce 
and encourage diversity of mind. Aside from diversity, 
criteria such as expertise, knowledge and competence will 
continue to inform the recruitment process.
The total Group’s workforce is currently predominantly 
f
emale (67 – 33 ratio), while at top management level, 
the ratio is 38% women to 62% men. The share of women 
within the top 100 positions is balanced and has varied 
over the past years from 48% in 2022 to 46% in 2023, 
evolution being influenced partly by the internalisation 
pr
ocess during 2022 and 2023.
The tables in this section depict the gender mix in 
different staff categories across the Group.
The numbers are in line with the general demographic 
dis
tribution and the one of the workforces profiled for the

culture is encouraged to ensure the Group can attract 
skilled and strong professionals. The Group recognises 
that a balanced distribution enhances team dynamics 
and increases productivity, therefore it is committed to 
aspire to reach a good distribution of roles between male 
and female.
Ratio of basic salary and remuneration 
acr
oss genders
A key measure of diversity and equity is the pay ratio by 
gender
. The Group monitors the salary ratio of women and 
men for each category of management, each department 
and team, as well as regions and countries.
At Group level, for the 2023 salary packages, across

Age diversity
The Group encourages diversity across age, based on 
the e
xperience, maturity, needs, and skillset required 
to deliver the business strategy, helping to increase 
innovation and creative problem-solving. Each of the four 
generations below has different strengths, preferences, 
and work styles that are determined by the world

Employee engagement 
Freedom of association
In line with local legislation, both in Romania and in 
P
oland, the Company took the initiative to communicate 
and raise awareness on employee’s social dialogue, 
by inviting the employees to organise and engage 
in consultation with the employer. In Romania, no 
such group of representatives was formed due to 
limited interest expressed by employees. In Poland, 
representatives of employees have been selected to 
the extent required by law. The purpose is to facilitate 
consultancy and compliance with employee rights within 
the organisation, while implementing internal regulations 
such as Work Regulations, Remuneration Regulations 
and Remote Working Regulations. The Polish group 
is functional and relevant interaction and consultation 
is ongoing.
During 2023, an employee union was created in 
R
omania, however, it has not yet reached the minimum 
number of members to operate as a representative 
union for all employees. Upon formation, the respective 
union engages, under the limited mandate, with 
the management. Management remains committed to 
continue the social dialogue under the specific
 legal 
frameworks, within the relevant scope of discussions 
and actions.
Considering the relatively small number of employees 
spr
ead across different geographies in the region where 
the Gr
oup operates, together with the HR policies around 
remuneration, retention, development, selection, as well 
as the Code of Ethics provisions governing the business, 
the Group did not consider, nor has it been (on legal 
grounds) required by employees to implement a collective 
bargaining agreement.
The Group remains committed to complying with the 
social dialogue legisla
tion and to respect the freedom of 
association of employees.
Employees benefits
To ensure reward and compensation are aligned with 
the mark
et, the Group relies on market data from 
experienced providers.
The benefits package applies to all employees across the 
Gr
oup, with no differentiation based on geography or full-
time/
part-time working schedule, and consists of:
• Flexible return-to-work schedule for employees 
r
eturning from maternity/parental leave
• Flexible working program
• work from home up to 6 days per month
• short Fridays subject to specific internal guidelines
• one-off allowance for parents upon childbirth
• one-off allowance for other family events
• employee well-being initiatives such as: participation 
in sport e
vents, subsidizing gym subscription, 
employee health insurance and private subscriptions 
to medical services
• social gatherings and parties for both employees and 
their childr
en at Christmas
• paid days off, on top of annual leave and statutory 
holidays, to allow people to bridge through longer 
weekends around Easter, Christmas, or New Year's Eve
• paid trainings, business 
certifications and access to 
busines
s events
• healthy food and drinks at work
• gifts and wellbeing workshops for special days 
(W
omen’s Day, Easter, Spring Day)
7,904 days were granted in 2023 for parental/childcare 
lea
ve, across all countries, in line with the applicable 
labour laws.
The Group implemented a wellbeing platform in 2022 
and sinc
e then, it offers podcasts, blogs and workshops 
with the aim to increase employee engagement. In 2023, 
over 120 online resources were available to all Group 
employees to support a healthy and balanced lifestyle.
Key features of the platform include:
• repository of wellbeing resources and programs 
(videos, articles, ph
ysical therapy exercises, financial 
education, do it yourself projects)
• access to various workshops and challenges
• possibility to upload own materials
• a gamified experience where users can gather points, 
r
each the next level and earn prizes
Sport challenges across the Group
As a company initiative to encourage healthy lifestyle, 
taking plac
e for several years, employees of the Group are 
encouraged and financiallysupported to attend marathons 
held in Spring and A
utumn in Bucharest and Amsterdam.

Sus tainability report
The "Step Challenge" was organised in 2023, aimed to 
challenge the t
eam spirit, resilience and healthy habits of 
employees, as well as increase employee engagement.
Highlights of "Step Challenge":
14 mixed teams with 10 members each, virtually “visited” 
some of the shopping c
enters across CEE in a challenge 
to walk 3,500,000 steps, around 2,700 km
The virtual journey started in Forum Gdansk Shopping 
C
enter (Poland), went through 8 of the shopping centres 
in differentcountries, and reached Promenada Craiova 
(R
omania) on its grand opening day
Over 5 weeks, 140 employees, more than 37,000,000 
s
teps. Participating employees received public recognition 
and rewards for their commitment and amazing results
The challenge was an engagement experience company-
wide
, fully digitalised, resulting in a boost of energy and 
team spirit, rewards and celebration.
People engagement, retention 
and de
velopment
Engagement and retention
Engagement and retention of key employees are two 
int
erlinked essential elements for the efficiencyand 
continuity of the business. Retention of staffis a 
challenging manda
te for the Group's leadership in the 
context of evolving landscape of work and workforce, 
as well as a difficultand competitive labour market in 
CEE. The market is still facing significantmigration of 
labour f
orce towards Western Europe. A large part 
of the workforce has shifted towards more flexibleand 
rather non-typical career options for progression, with 
short
er time in roles and change of career direction more 
frequently. The shift towards entrepreneurship and remote 
working was still felt during 2023 and represented one of 
the reasons for turnover or challenges in attracting talent.
To keep employees engaged, NEPI Rockcastle considers 
tha
t being transparent, creating opportunities for people 
to understand the Company purpose, strategy, and 
performance, is essential in encouraging employees to feel 
proud they work and represent NEPI Rockcastle. During 
2023, the Group continued to strengthen management 
communication, in both regular meetings, internal 
conferences, as well as through strategy discussions and 
business updates.
The leadership engagement through Friday Talks platform 
c
ontinued and represented one of the most relevant 
communication channels.
The internal communication platform SPOT continued 
t
o be the place to share information and create 
communities. SPOT brings together information that 
used to be spread across differentlocations, from 
mes
sages from CEO, to strategy and financialupdates, 
internal policies awareness campaigns, news on the 
Gr
oup's portfolio and its employees, marketing campaigns 
in the shopping centres, wellbeing events, guidance 
regarding the performance management process, training 
opportunities. Approximately 170 posts were published in 
2023, enabling people to stay informed and participate in 
different
 challenges.
Employee engagement survey
During 2023, NEPI Rockcastle carried out the 
sec
ond edition of the engagement and employee 
satisfaction survey.
The People Engagement Index increased by 1%, reaching 
82% in 20
23. The survey generated a response rate of 
93% (4% higher than in 2022), demonstrating once again 
the engagement of the employees to speak up and 
communicate their needs and feedback.

Focus groups and de-brief discussions were organised, 
with the aim t
o understand main triggers of engagement. 
These resulted into action plans at business unit, 
department or group level, implemented during 2023 or 
planned for 2024.
The results of the survey, as well as the focus groups, 
indica
ted three organisational strengths:
• working together as a team and supporting the 
c
olleagues in need
• taking responsibility and accountability over work
• valuing and respecting the Company and its people
Although the actions undertaken during 2022 translated 
int
o a higher engagement score, more is needed to 
address some priority areas, such as stress level, employee 
recognition and top-down communication over strategy.
The key engagement priorities addressed in 2023:
• Wellbeing and flexibility – Support people in 
identifying sour
ces of stress and build ways to reduce 
and manage stress to improve wellbeing:
» managing stress and workload virtual workshops
» "Step Challenge"
» continue with Flexible Working – hybrid work, 
flexiblehours, short Fridays
• Leadership, direction and alignment – Increase 
t
op-down communication and transparency over 
NEPI Rockcastle strategy, business priorities and 
achievements. Continue to advance with the Group’s 
integration of all business functions to increase 
communication, teamwork, and collaboration:
» enforce regular/thematic/by business line Friday 
T
alks with top management team (Group 
strategy for the next 3 years; business updates, 
key projects, achievements, new developments; 
changes at Group level)
» team business events/workshops for: Asset 
Management, L
easing, Property management, 
Centre management, Legal and Compliance, HR, 
Financ

• Recognition – Further emphasise the importance 
of recognition, build the needed skills to provide 
recognition and tailor motivation:

The next engagement survey will be organised during

engage and motivate its employees.
Recruitment and selection
One of the most important pillars of a strong and 
suc
cessful people organisation is the structure and quality 
of the team. Having the right people in the right place, 
with the appropriate skillset, is a business imperative 
for leadership as well as a core HR responsibility. 
The CEE labour market continues to be competitive 
and challenging in terms of workforce. Therefore, the 
recruitment and selection process remained a strategic 
area of focus for the business and one where the 
Group invests time and resources to both attract and 
retain talent.
To serve all markets in which the Group has teams, 
the C
ompany uses its wide network of hiring managers 
(including external partners and agencies) to scan the 
markets, source the most appropriate candidates, recruit 
and onboard the necessary competencies. The Group’s HR 
team uses people analytics to make decisions in relation 
to the personnel strategy (including Hogan assessment, 
California Psychological Inventory (CPI), Thomas – DISC). 
The data is stored in the HR administrative internal system 
and has, over years, started to show valuable insights

about the structure of the teams, the competencies, and 
the skillset both in plac
e and needed.
As the Group is transforming, integrating, and 
c
onsolidating as a mature business, the teams are 
growing, and new competencies are required. The 
Group reinforced, as part of the recruitment process, 
an approach which requires management to support 
the hiring decision with a solid business case, role 
profile,
 impact on the organisation and return on the 
investment. This allowed to leverage more and better on 
internal available resources and support career growth of 
existing personnel.
After the 2022 successful onboarding of new Group 
leaders c
oordinating functions such as Marketing, Asset 
Management, Property Management, Sustainability and 
Procurement, the Group continued to strengthen the 
management team, by bringing new competences in 
Energy, Digital, Processes and Systems, Regional HR, to 
take the business further and ensure sustainable growth.
Employee hiring
The recruitment activity was intensive during 2023. 
15
9 people have joined NEPI Rockcastle, either in new 
positions, replacement or as part of local management 
team internalisation.
34 new employees joined the Group as part of the 
int
ernalisation that the Group initiated in 2022 and 
continued in 2023.
In this respect, for all the assets in the portfolio where the 
as
set management and local operations were externalised 
to third parties, the Group has strategically decided to 
internalise teams and processes.
The process of internalisation will continue in 2024 as part 
of a r
evised business model aligned across all jurisdictions.
Alongside the internalisation, the Group further 
pr
ogressed on integrating its operations and business 
model, to consolidate teams and streamline processes.
Internalisation, integration, and newly created teams are 
people-int
ensive processes, engaging a high number of 
people in the hiring and onboarding processes. These are 
critical to ensure integration from a cultural, as well as 
from an operational perspective.
Employee Turnover
Monitoring employee turnover is particularly important 
and r
epresents a priority for both HR and team leaders 
across the Group. While monitoring internal turnover, NEPI 
Rockcastle is engaged in understanding the dynamics of 
the market and reading into the social aspects or any 
related symptoms that influence
 turnover, apart from the 
internal factors.
In 2023, the labour market dynamics and staff turnover 
c
ontinued to be affected by employees changing 
preferences towards remote working, entrepreneurial 
careers, and package-driven decision.
Inflation
 was again a critical element of the increased 
dynamic on the labour market in 2023, which, although 
reduced versus the previous financial year, still remained 
a
t high levels.

For 2023, the blended voluntary turnover rate across 
all jurisdictions w
as 7.4%, while the non-voluntary rate 
was 3.5%. The non-voluntary turnover is related to the 
Group's performance-focused approach and consequence 
management processes, as strong performance and 
delivery against the role is essential for building a 
long-term career within the Company. NEPI Rockcastle 
encourages management to empower strong performance 
and not to tolerate lack of commitment or compromising 
on values and business integrity.
In managing retention, the Group focused on 
supporting emplo
yees in finding the appropriate work-life 
balanc
e and integrating their professional and personal 
responsibilities. Such efforts led to more engaged, 
motivated, and committed employees and increased 
a
ttractiveness of NEPI Rockcastle as employer. Both the 
team managers and HR engage in discussions with leavers 
in the most relevant cases, in order to determine areas 
for improvement and reduce the risk of losing talent to 
the market.
The group also operates a career transition programme 
f
or specific cases of involuntary termination. The initiative 
aims t
o support through:
• individual career discussions with the HR team
• assistance in accessing professional services, such as 
c
oaching or placement agency engagement

Professional development and training
One of the key pillars of NEPI Rockcastle's people 
s
trategy and value proposition is the constant investment 
into people development. Over the past few years, 
NEPI Rockcastle has invested gradually more and 
more resources and focused on growing strategic 
leadership and technical competencies in its teams, hence 
strengthening the overall value and skillset.
The professional development activities have evolved 
both in s
tructure and in numbers, reaching 29,392 hours 
in 2023 vs 24,587 in 2022, in average 6 days/employee 
(overall) and 7.1 days per trained employee, for a total of 
515 employees actively engaged.
In an unpredictable and fast paced business environment, 
the c
ompetencies and skills of the Group's teams 
represented a critical success factor. Professional 
development and training allow employees to acquire 
new skills, improve existing ones and perform better on 
their jobs, be great leaders and remain motivated in 
the workplace.
HR and team managers encourage employees career 
de
velopment and transition to different roles and teams, 
to allow for professional development and growth 
opportunities. This process includes individual career 
discussions, exploration of skills, competencies, and areas 
of interest, alongside identification of relevant openings. 
A v
aried range of transitions have been made possible 
throughout 2023, from roles within the marketing, 
accounting, and administrative teams to areas like digital 
& technology, systems and applications, leasing, asset, 
digital marketing, and social media.
The Professional Development Strategy is mainly driven 
b
y business priorities and people development needs. 
The business strategy is cascaded into learning plans, by 
closely identifying the skills and competencies needed to 
deliver the strategy and then providing the right people 
with the right skillset.
During 2023 the HR and leadership team continued to 
guide the Pr
ofessional Development Strategy based on 
the three important business and people imperatives:
1.Integration of business across the Group;
2. Growth of business by preparing for the evolving 
landscape of w
ork and workforce;
3. Engagement of people, communication, and 
tr
ansparency around business information.
A thorough development needs analysis was carried 
out, based on the emplo
yees personal development 
plans, discussions with the managers about the 
strategic agenda and team objectives, 360 feedback 
and engagement survey results. This analysis resulted 
in several relevant development priorities, such as 
various technical skills, communication, leadership, 
persuasion and 
influence, negotiation, planning and 
project management, problem solving, self-management, 
teamwork, public speaking, coaching.
Professional development is structured at NEPI Rockcastle 
as blended learning, so it c
ombines both training 
programmes and other learning contexts such as 
conferences, coaching, business meetings, networking 
and industry events, participation in Group-wide people 
initiatives, peer learning, internal communication.
Some of the core programmes rolled in 2023 were 
designed ar
ound the need to further consolidate the 
succession pipeline for the centre management function 
and to raise the level of the team management skills:
• The Leadership Journey for Centre Managers – the 
sec
ond edition was delivered for 20 centre managers 
after the positive feedback during the 2022 pilot with 
planned follow-up in 2024
• Leading Teams - more than 45 people 
managers participa
ted
• Managing Stress and Workload – almost 60 
people participa
ted
• Process Communication Model (PCM) – 43 high 
pot
entials attended the programme during 2023
The Leadership Journey for Centre Managers was 
s
tructured around 4 modules, 8 days of blended learning 
across 5 months, in 3 locations (Sofia, Vilnius, Zagreb). 
The purpose was to equip centre managers with the right 
skills to 
effectively navigate and lead in the face of digital 
transformation by:
• laying a common understanding of the 
Gr
oup's business
• getting on-board with the market trends and 
indus
try insights
• developing a deeper understanding of the customer, 
learn t
o master communication and negotiation skills
Additionally, the programme envisaged to transform the 
Gr
oup's team leaders mindset into an innovative one, 
taking their people management skills to the next level 
and thus, preparing the leaders for succession.
The competencies the Group was looking to develop 
included: busines
s acumen, technical skills (finance, 
reporting, property), consumer understanding and 
profiling, commercial relationships and communication, 
negotiation skills, leadership - self (growth mindset 
and entrepreneurship) and others (leading by SMART 
objectives, motivation, and delegation).
2023 was the second year that the Leading Teams 
programme was delivered as a strategic line in the 
learning plan, r
esulting from the People Engagement 
survey. The theme consisting of people’s need to feel 
more motivated, recognised and supported by their 
leaders with empathy and growth mindset remained key. 
To help team managers in these challenging mandates 
to lead people, the Group created a practical training 
programme aimed to bring a visible impact into the 
participants and their teams development.

t
o feed-forward

Change management - business strategy and business 
integration events 
A strategic business priority in 2023 was to progress 
with oper
ations integration across the Group, which led 
to several levels of transformation both in processes, 
teams, and roles. To support the communication and the 
understanding of this transformation, a series of change 
management events were organised over a period of four 
months. 18 Integration Team Events and two Leadership 
Strategy Workshops took place, with more than 360 
people in Romania, Poland, The Netherlands, Croatia, 
Czech Republic, Slovakia, Lithuania attending.
During in average 2 days, teams spent quality time 
t
ogether having a blended type agenda, covering the 
business strategy, structure, processes, while focusing 
also on people agenda: leadership, team collaboration, 
diversity and inclusion, social interaction and relationship 
building. The integration events were enhanced by 
group coaching sessions, sport competitions such as 
golfing,
 boxing, biking and business simulations, to allow 
development of situational leadership, crisis management 
skills, collaboration, sustainability and resilience.
Functional training
The development of the Group’s operations, the 
int
egration agenda, the digital transformation journey, and 
the alignment of processes raised further challenges on 
the resources and skills front. The Group comprehended 
the need to build or strengthen competencies in 
the organisation, such as sustainability, marketing, 
procurement, systems and data transformation.
These priorities, as well as the ongoing need to keep 
emplo
yees updated on the technical matters, resulted 
into approximately 9,000 hours of technical training. 
This aimed to increase knowledge and expertise on a 
range of 
different topics: asset management, compliance 
and risk, digital, sustainability, procurement, Microsoft 
Office,
 finance and accounting, IFRS, laws and regulations, 
mark
eting, Power BI, English and Romanian languages.
20 employees from the marketing team across the 
Gr
oup attended the Fundamentals of Marketing and 
Communication module delivered by the IAA School. 
The programme was structured like a limited MBA and 
was addressed to young professionals with maximum 3 
years of experience in marketing or communication. The 
programme lasted 6 months and was split into 20 virtual 
sessions with a focus on basic knowledge and skills.
Moreover, all employees have been trained during 2023 
on t
opics such as cybersecurity, risk management, data 
protection, sustainability. Such trainings are regularly 
organised, and participation is typically mandatory for 
all employees.

Conferences and business events
To keep up with trends in the real estate industry, 
emplo
yees attended conferences and events where global 
thinkers and elitist community of world-changers were 
delivering business insights. These are an important part

Performance management process
The high performing culture NEPI Rockcastle aims to 
build is gr
ounded on the quality and thoroughness 
of the performance management process. The Group 
has implemented a process that is round, complete 
and focuses on delivering results against objectives, 
while maintaining professional conduct and superior 
management capabilities.
Alignment of personal interests and objectives to the 
objectiv
es and strategic priorities of the business sits at 
the core of this process.
At individual level, the performance management process 
is built ar
ound the Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) 
methodology, to manage performance, set business 
objectives and monitor progress towards results. This 
methodology enhanc
ed focus, productivity, efficiency, 
alignment of objectives to strategy. It was also an 
opportunity f
or the manager and employee to assess the 
achievement of the business, commercial and strategic 
objectives during the previous year and discuss areas for 
future development.
The process is fully digitalised, and data is stored 
in a pla
tform integrated within the Company’s 
internal communication portal “Spot”, which serves as 
repository for individual performance goals and facilitates 
communication between manager and team members.
The performance review is an annual solid and continuous 
pr
ocess, structured in five cyclic steps:
Objectives and Key Results
All employees discuss and agree the set of key objectives, KPIs, strategic priorities (with OKRs 
as
sociated) and personal development aspirations. Once agreed, the annual Objectives Plan is 
validated and confirmed by the Manager.
Mid-year check-in
Managers and team members document a mid-year check-in, as a formal review of objectives and 
c
ompletion level. This is an opportunity for employees to monitor progress towards results, to identify 
elements of challenge or change, agree specific interventions and actions to overcome matters that 
c
ould prevent achievement of objectives.
Year-end review
Covers two important elements:
1. 360 feedback review, applicable for managerial and senior-expert roles, designed to help the 
emplo
yees understand the impact of their behaviour, attitude, and engagement. This review is 
behavioural, aimed at assessing people’s behaviour and management capabilities, as well as the 
adherence to the Group’s values and principles. The results are considered by the manager as part 
of the overall annual performance evaluation;
2. Performance feedback – the employee and the manager discuss and document their view on the 
le
vel of achievement of the annual plan, discuss areas of improvement and development, results of 
360 feedback and conclude on the annual performance rating.
Calibration meetings
HR together with the relevant Group Heads of functions and the CEO review the outcomes and 
calibr
ate results across the Group, functions, levels of seniority. The calibration meetings are meant to 
ensure same performance standards are applied and that the overall performance ratings distribution 
at Group level is healthy and balanced.
Bonus, awarded on a discretionary basis, is aligned across the firm and is set in line with the 
perf
ormance rating, while the salary is calibrated in line with the role, career move, promotion and 
based on external reward market dynamic.
Communication
The final performance rating, potential role update, alongside the respective reward (bonus, salary 
increase) are communicated to each employee. Specific outputs of the process, the areas for 
de
velopment are taken forward in the following year’s objectives plan, as a remediation or personal/
professional development plan.
2023 Performance Review facts and figures
535 members of staff took part (either reviewed and / or 
providing feedback) in the Annual Performance Review. 
Overall, the Group reached a balanced score distribution, 
indicating healthy and well differentiated feedback. 
Details ar
e also included in the Remuneration Report, 
page 126.
44 % of staff taking part in the annual performance review 
received 360 feedback. Scores increased in some critical 
competencies which have been addressed throughout 
2023 by trainings and business events.
Employees health, safety and 
labour c
onditions
The Group prioritises employee safety and health. Each 
emplo
yee is made aware of the Group's applicable 
guidelines and follow all applicable safety procedures and 
programs, while supervisors are responsible for ensuring 
that all reasonable safeguards and precautions are taken 
in the workplace.
Measures are taken to ensure that the laws and guidelines 
ar
e followed and that a proper work environment is 
maintained at all times. The Group will not accept in any 
of its properties or in relation to any supplier, practices 
such as forced labour or child labour.

Employees training on occupational health and safety 
is pr
ovided in all jurisdictions, in line with the 
local legislation.
During 2023, the Romanian Labour Authority performed a 
r
egular inspection which resulted in few recommendations 
for further updates to the internal processes. As a result, 
the Company has revised some of the existing processes, 
implemented all necessary measures and reported back to 
the Authority.
If an employee has safety concerns, these can be 
r
eported to the Health and Safety co-ordinator or they 
can use the whistleblowing channels. No complaints 
have been recorded on potential issues related to 
health and safety labour conditions and there were no 
accidents at work, no reported occupational diseases 
and no deaths. Consequently, no days of sick leave or

Green and Sustainability-linked funding strategy
In June 2020, the Group implemented its inaugural 
Gr
een Finance Framework and committed to use 
proceeds from green financing instruments to finance 
or refinance existing and future projects which improve 
the environmental performance of the Group’s property 
portfolio. The Framework followed the principles of the 
International Capital Markets Association, Green Bond 
Principles 2018 and Loan Market Association, Green Loan 
Principles 2020, and benefitted from a positive Second 
P
arty Opinion from Sustainalytics, a leading independent 
global provider of ESG and corporate governance 
research and ratings.
In June 2023, the Group updated its Green Finance 
Fr
amework, receiving a Second Party Opinion issued by 
ISS Corporate Solutions. The update of the framework 
serves primarily to strengthen the environmental 
sustainability of eligible assets, enhancing the eligibility 
criteria to cater for future alignment with the substantial 
contribution criteria of the EU-Taxonomy. Going forward, 
both newly issued, and currently outstanding bonds will 
be governed by the updated 2023 framework, with 
allocation to a single portfolio of assets fully in line with 
the updated, more ambitious eligibility criteria. The 2023 
revised Framework is aligned with ICMA Green Bond 
Principles 2021 and the LMA Green Loan Principles 2023.
Issuance in green format ensures additional transparency 
f
or debt investors on the use and impact of funds. 
The objective of green labelled funding issued under 
the framework is to support NEPI Rockcastle’s transition 
towards more sustainable real estate, in line with one 
of the Group’s strategic pillars, “Invest in healthy and 
sustainable buildings”.
€1 billion green bonds have been issued under the Green 
Financ
e Framework (€500 million in July 2020, and 
another €500 million in January 2022). Moreover, two 
green loan agreements concluded with IFC (one in June 
2021 and one in December 2023) have same undertakings 
as per this framework.
The Group continued to increase the share of green 
financing in its total debt, year on year.
The full document is published on the corporate website: 
Green Financing Framework June 2023 .

In October 2023, NEPI Rockcastle took a pioneering 
s
tep by launching its Sustainability-linked Financing 
Framework (SLFF). This represents a holistic approach to 
sustainable financing, by linking the financial instruments 
directly to the sustainability KPIs. The full document is 
published on the corporate website: Sustainability Linked 
Financing Framework October 2023.
The SLFF is an alternative to the green funding approach, 
and the f
ollowing unsecured loan facilities have been 
concluded under this ambitious framework:
• €387 million loan with IFC, a member of the 
W
orld Bank
• €196 million revolving credit facility with Raiffeisen 
Bank International and Erste Group
• €150 million revolving credit facility with a club of 3 
bank
s (Citi, Deutsche Bank and HSBC)
NEPI Rockcastle has set sustainability as a strategic 
priority both a
t the core of its operations and its 
corporate financing. The recently contracted unsecured 
gr
een loan arranged by IFC has specific clauses that 
r
einforce the Group’s commitment to strengthening 
operations and development pipeline in a sustainable 
way, aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
and increasing energy 
efficiency in the Group’s 
pr
operty portfolio.
This senior unsecured facility is innovatively structured as 
a gr
een loan with sustainability-linked features, making it 
the first of its kind for NEPI Rockcastle.
By leveraging the Group’s long-standing partnership with 
IF
C, NEPI Rockcastle has strengthened its position as a 
frontrunner in sustainable finance in the CEE region. This 
suc
cessful financing project is once again confirming NEPI 
Rockcastle’s positive role in building a sustainable regional 
private sector in the CEE region.
Separately from the Green and Sustainability-linked 
Financ
e frameworks, but in line with the Company’s 
commitment for sustainable business, three bilateral loans 
in Romania were concluded in green format and secured 
on the following properties: Ploiesti Shopping City, Mega 
Mall and Promenada Sibiu. All three financed properties 
hold BREEAM In-Use Excellent certifications and Class A 
ener
gy performance certificates.
Apart from the two revolving credit facilities that are 
c
oncluded based on the newly launched SLFF of the 
Group, two more revolving credit facilities are linked to 
the stainability rating provided by Sustainalytics.

EU Taxonomy Report
Eligibility and alignment to the EU Taxonomy
Context
The European Union established the EU Taxonomy to 
help driv
e capital towards financing the EU environmental 
transition. The taxonomy is a unified classification system 
meant t
o provide investors and policymakers with 
appropriate definitions on which economic activities can 
be considered environmentally sustainable. Consequently, 
all economic activities listed in the scope of the Taxonomy 
Regulation (i.e. “eligible” activities) are to be screened for 
their environmental impacts, based on the environmental 
criteria (“Technical Screening Criteria”) defined in the 
T
axonomy Delegated Acts.
NEPI Rockcastle is required to report on its activities 
eligibility and alignment t
o EU Taxonomy. In compiling 
the analysis and deriving the relevant disclosures, the 
following was addressed:
• The activity substantially contributes to at least one 
of the six en
vironmental objectives, as defined in 
the regulation:
»Climate change mitigation;
» Climate change adaptation;
» The sustainable use and protection of water and 
marine r
esources;
» The transition to a circular economy;
» Pollution prevention and control; and
» The protection and restoration of biodiversity 
and ec
osystems
• The activity does no significant harm to any of the 
other five environmental objectives
• The Group complies with the minimum safeguards 
defined in the taxonomy
Disclosure on alignment is currently required for the first 
two environmental objectives (climate change mitigation 
and adapta
tion). Starting 2024, alignment to the other 4 
environmental objectives needs to be disclosed as well.
Eligibility of NEPI Rockcastle’s activities in line with the 
EU Taxonomy
Based on the Climate Delegated Act, NEPI Rockcastle has 
det
ermined three main eligible activities:
• CCM 7.1: Construction of new buildings: buildings that 
NEPI R
ockcastle develops with a purpose to sell
• CCM 7.7: Acquisition and ownership of the buildings: 
buildings that NEPI Rockcastle owns and operates, 
including those under de
velopment or redevelopment 
that do not exceed “major renovation” threshold
• CCM 7.6: Installation, maintenance, and repair 
of renewable energy technologies: installation of 
photovoltaic panels and auxiliary equipment on the 
roof or carports in shopping malls
NEPI Rockcastle has concluded that under the 
En
vironmental Delegated Act published by the European 
Commission at the end of 2023, the CE3.1. Construction 
of new buildings qualifies as an eligible economic 
activity that significantly contributes to the objective of 
transitioning to a circular economy. This aligns with CCM 
7.1 activity, therefore additional analysis and disclosure is 
not required for 2023.

KPIs calculation methodology
Allocation rules to the denominators
As defined in the Delegated Regulation, total turnover 
and total CAPEX have been determined in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
applied to NEPI Rockcastle’s activities and in line with 
financial statements:
• Total turnover = Gross rental income + Service charge 
inc
ome + Revenues from sales of inventory property
• Total CAPEX = Capital expenditure on investment 
pr
operties in use + Additions from construction of 
investment property under development + Additions 
from construction of inventory property
Operating expenditure (OPEX) as defined by the EU 
Taxonomy relates to “building renovation measures, short-
term lease, maintenance and repair, and any other direct 
expenditure relating to the day-to-day servicing” of 
Group’s assets. Therefore, for the purpose of reporting 
on Operating expenditure as 
defined above, NEPI 
R
ockcastle considered the share of property operating 
expenses recognised in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income which encompasses the non-
capitalised costs incurred for the general maintenance and 
repairs of buildings.
While these relate to the eligible activity of acquiring 
and o
wning buildings, service charge expenses incurred 
for operating NEPI Rockcastle Group’s assets — such as 
utility expenses, cleaning and security expenses, property 
related taxes, property management and marketing fees, 
while significant, are not included in the OPEX KPI, based 
on the definition provided in the EU Taxonomy.

Sus tainability report
For the same reason, payroll and other general expenses, 
which ar
e usually categorised as OPEX and contribute to 
the Group’s activity of acquiring and owning buildings, are 
not included either.
• Total OPEX = OPEX for maintenance + OPEX 
f
or repairs
Allocation rules to the numerators: determining 
eligible activities
In determination of the eligible share of Turnover 
(numer
ator), the revenue categories considered by the 
Group according to the Delegated Acts’ definitions 
of activities were all revenues from acquisition and 
o
wnership of buildings and revenues from property 
development (revenues from construction of new 
buildings for sale).
For the CAPEX numerator, all costs are considered 
eligible
, as these are associated with the following 
eligible activities:
• acquisition and ownership of shopping centers
• installation, maintenance, and repair of renewable 
ener
gy technologies
• construction of buildings for sale (residential units)
The eligible share of OPEX (numerator) is considered to 
c
over the same scope of OPEX categories as for the 
OPEX denominator, these being specifically listed in the 
Delega
ted Regulation scoping the expenses to consider.
Alignment of NEPI Rockcastle’s activities with 
the EU T
axonomy
Once eligible activities have been assessed, screening and 
disclosur
e of the share of environmentally sustainable or 
“aligned” activities was performed. The resulting share of 
aligned activities in the company’s Turnover, CAPEX and 
OPEX are disclosed.

Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation
To qualify as substantially contributing to climate change mitigation for each of its eligible activities, across its portfolio, NEPI Rockcastle 
mus
t meet the following criteria:
Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation
7.1 Construction of new buildings 7.6 Installation, maintenance and repair of 
renewable energy technologies 7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings
The Primary Energy Demand 
(PED
), is at least 10 % lower 
than the threshold set for 
the nearly zero-energy building 
(NZEB) requirement
The activity consists in installation of on-site 
r
enewable energy technologies such as solar 
photovoltaic systems
For buildings built before 31 December 2020, 
the building has a
t least an Energy Performance 
Certificate (EPC) class A
AND OR
Airtightness and thermal integrity 
t
ests are performed
For buildings built before 31 December 2020, the 
building is within the t
op 15% of the national or 
regional building stock expressed as operational 
Primary Energy Demand (PED)
For buildings built after 31 December 2020, the 
building needs to meet the criteria specified in 
the category 7.1. Construction of new building, 
that are relevant at the time of the acquisition or 
the construction
AND AND
Lifecycle Global Warming Potential 
of the building is calc
ulated for 
each stage
Where the building is a large non-residential 
building, it is efficiently operated through energy 
performance monitoring and assessment
New Construction
In accordance with the taxonomy, new construction is 
defined as development of building projects for later 
sale or construction on a fee or contract basis. The 
2023 assessment under technical screening criteria was 
conducted for the completed and under construction 
projects. For each investment a dedicated EU Taxonomy 
assessment report was prepared.
Based on the EU Taxonomy assessment, the conclusion is 
tha
t projects that met the definition of New Construction 
according EU Taxonomy did not meet the alignment 
criteria, following the assessment of the substantial 
contribution technical screening criteria above.
Acquisition and ownership
In accordance with the EU Taxonomy, the definition of the 
ac
quisition and ownership means buying real estate and 
exercising ownership of the real estate.
NEPI Rockcastle uses EPCs (Energy Performance 
Certificates), as a criterion to determine the alignment of 
owned buildings built before December 2020. For assets 
located in Poland, the Company compares Primary Energy 
Demand against the benchmark provided by Ministry 
of Economic Development and Technology, as there is 
no A-F EPC classification available. The requirements 
r
elated to efficient operation through energy performance 
monit
oring and assessment is covered through the energy 
consumption monitoring tool, implementation of Building 
Management Systems in all buildings, internal manuals, 
maintenance contracts.
Buildings built after 31 December 2020 were assessed 
based on the crit
eria specified for category 7.1., 
Construction of new buildings.
Substantial contribution to climate 
change adapta
tion
According to FAQ 2022/C 385/01 of the European 
C
ommission, there are two types of activities that 
can make substantial contribution to climate change 
adaptation: adaptation activities and enabling economic 
activities. NEPI Rockcastle considers as eligible and 
aligned with this objective only the CAPEX associated 
with adaptation plans meant to reduce the most 
important (material and medium to high risk related) 
physical climate change risks. The Company performed 
the climate change risk analysis and vulnerability 
assessment in compliance with Appendix A of the 
Taxonomy Delegated Acts. In 2024 detailed adaptation 
plans with specific measures will be developed, therefore, 
in 20
23, no CAPEX related to adaptation activities has 
been reported.
Do no significant harm (DNSH) criteria
Adaptation to climate change
Pursuant to the release of the Climate Delegated Act 
specifying DNSH crit
eria on adaptation to climate change, 
NEPI Rockcastle has conducted climate change risk 
assessment analysis covering all of Group’s assets, as 
described on page 159.
Annual Report 2023 209

Page 210:
» continued
Sus tainability report
As a result of the climate hazard and vulnerability 
as
sessment, general adaptation measures were identified. 
In 2024 a detailed action plan will be prepared, covering 
pr
operties recognised as the ones potentially most at risk 
from climate change and business perspective. 
Other objectives
For projects classified in ownership of buildings (7.7), 
there are no DNSH criteria other than the one on climate 
change adaptation. For construction of new buildings (7.1), 
the analysis of the compliance with other DNSH criteria 
than climate change adaptation has been done at project 
level. As no CAPEX has been reported to substantially 
contribute to the objective of climate-change adaptation, 
the DNSH for climate-change mitigation has not been 
screened in 2023. For projects classified
 in installation, 
maintenance, and repair of renewable energy technologies 
(7.6.), a Climate adaptation report was prepared.
Minimum safeguards
The Group is committed to minimise the risk of 
viola
ting the basic human and labour rights defined by 
UN (United Nations), the ILO and the OECD and to 
comply with the Minimum Safeguards as described in 
Taxonomy Regulation.
The safeguards implemented at Group level to cover the 
minimum saf
eguards are further detailed below.
Policies and procedures are available to all personnel, 
in e
very country and entity. These are posted on 
the Group's unified engagement and communication 
platform, while key aspects such as the Code of Ethics, 
the Whistleblowing Policy, the Compliance Statement, 
and the Sustainability Commitment are available to 
all stakeholders, on the Group corporate website. 
Comprehensive details on the Compliance Management 
Program are disclosed in the Risk Management and 
Compliance section of the Annual Report and in Pillar 3 
of this Sustainability Report, page 188.
In 2023 the Group engaged with an external consultant 
and c
onducted a detailed due diligence process covering 
the minimum safeguards, including ILO Declaration on 
Fundamental Human Rights, in order to assess its 
compliance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation. As an 
outcome, the ILO Umbrella Policy was established, in line 
with the International Labour Standards, and tailored to 
the Company and its business model. This policy provides 
a unified framework that addresses and integrates the key 
principles and r
equirements outlined in the standards into 
the Company's operations and practices.
Human rights
The Company is strictly committed to upholding all 
fundamental individual rights and labour rights pr
otection, 
as well as safeguarding the health, safety, and wellbeing 
of its employees. Internal procedures are in place to 
anticipate, identify and prevent any infringement on 
employees’ human rights and freedoms. These include, for 
instance, clear rules against any form of discrimination 
along with anti-harassment and anti-bullying practices, 
including a whistleblowing hotline accessible 24/7 to all 
employees and external stakeholders. The Group stands 
against racism, discrimination, and bias of any kind, 
striving to ensure that everyone feels equally welcome. 
These principles are encompassed also in the Group 
Code of Ethics. The Group has a zero-tolerance principle 
for violation of these rules, makes sure to cultivate a 
sound work environment in which employees thrive, is 
committed to ensure equal opportunities, diversity and 
inclusion across the business as detailed in the D&I Policy 
and Charter.
Additionally, the Group is keen on being an enabler of the 
pr
otection of human rights in its value chain, as described 
in Pillar 2, Sustainability in the value chain section, on 
page 178.
Bribery/Corruption
To combat bribery and corruption, NEPI Rockcastle 
has implement
ed robust internal controls and a strong 
compliance program, aimed at preventing and detecting 
such practices. A comprehensive compliance assessment 
and fraud and corruption risk assessment is conducted 
annually, which covers bribery and corruption risks 
across all processes and value chain. Internal anti-
corruption guidelines have been established and regularly 
communicated through awareness focused compliance 
programs, aimed to ensure employees understand and 
adhere to principles that discourage corrupt practices 
(both active and passive corruption practices), in all 
jurisdictions where the Group operates. By educating its 
workforce, the Company aims to empower employees 
to recognise, resist, and report instances of bribery, 
ultimately creating a work environment that is resilient 
against corrupt practices and aligned with ethical 
standards. Comprehensive details on the Compliance 
Management System and the compliance program are 
disclosed in the Risk and Compliance Section, page 104 
and in Pillars two and three of the Sustainability report, 
pages 
178 and 188.
Taxation
The Company places significant emphasis on adopting 
and implementing r
obust tax risk management strategies 
as an integral component of its overall governance and 
risk management framework. Recognising the intricate 
nature of tax governance and compliance, the Company 
ensures that these elements are given due attention in its 
oversight mechanisms.

The Board of Directors plays a pivotal role in this 
pr
ocess. Tax risk management strategies have been 
adopted and are regularly monitored. These strategies 
are designed to identify and evaluate financial, regulatory, 
and r
eputational risks associated with taxation. By 
proactively monitoring, addressing and reporting tax-
related risks, the Company ensures compliance with 
regulatory requirements.
The Company has also implemented adequate policies 
and pr
ocedures to ensure taxation risks are monitored 
and properly addressed, given its multi-jurisdictional 
operating model. These have been compiled in line with 
the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational 
Enterprises and Tax Administrations. Also, the additional 
guidance provided by OECD through various papers 
(e.g., Transfer Pricing Guidance on Financial Transactions 
issued in February 2020, Guidance on the Transfer 
Pricing Implications on the Covid-19 Pandemic issued 
in December 2020) is considered when establishing / 
reviewing transfer prices.
The Audit Committee, as a sub-Committee of the Board is 
task
ed to oversee compliance with fiscal regulations. More 
details on task risk management ar
e included in the Risk 
and Compliance Section, page 104.
Fair Competition
NEPI Rockcastle recognises and prioritised as part 
of its risk management and c
ompliance program, its 
commitment to fair competition practices, in line with 
local legislation in each jurisdiction and internationally 
recognised best practice guidelines. Legal and regulatory 
landscape evolution is constantly monitored, and 
appropriate measures are taken to ensure compliance. The 
Company organises regular training and communication 
programs, at all staff
 levels, meant to raise awareness 
of fair competition best practices, legal and regulatory 
requirements. By instilling a strong understanding of 
compliance obligations at all organisational levels, the 
Company aims to create a workforce and leadership
team that is vigilant, ethically aligned, and collectively 
c
ommitted to fair and equitable business practices, in 
relation to tenants, suppliers and direct competitors, in 
the market it operates.
Comprehensive details on the Compliance Management 
S
ystem and the compliance program are disclosed in the 
Risk and Compliance Section in the Annual Report.

Organisational boundaries
NEPI Rockcastle reports on 100% of the assets (60 in 
t
otal) under its operational and financial control.
The data reported covers 60 income producing properties 
and all of its staff against the defined impacts and targets, 
as detailed on page 28-5
9. The portfolio comprises of 
56 retail properties, 2 office buildings and 2 industrial 
properties, where the Group has operational and financial 
control. For more details, please see Property Schedule 
(page 
330 ).
Control is understood as the legal capacity to monitor 
and mak
e decisions on supply chain management, utilities 
consumption and facilities management. This excludes any 
area over which the tenant has full control in terms of 
contracting, monitoring consumption and payment. The 
Group is making 
efforts to collect data from the tenants 
– fully controlled areas, for a broader perspective on its 
environmental impacts.
Center and Technical Managers monitor utility 
c
onsumption (energy and water) and waste on the asset 
level while the Sustainability Analyst at the corporate 
level verifies Group-wide figures on a monthly basis. The 
Group uses Deepki to standardise its monthly reporting 
of energy, water and waste data. The platform enables 
data analysis at portfolio level, embeds climate factors 
and allows shopping center performance benchmarking. 
Social data related to human resources is monitored 
using an information system, enabling standardised and 
structured management of data based on a single source. 
Community engagement partnerships (with suppliers and 
NGOs) are monitored in structured data files and an 
annual r
eview is in place, engaging local teams, Regional 
Marketing and Sustainability Department.
Coverage and Estimations
The Group incorporates in this report data pertaining to 
e
very environmental aspect across all properties under its 
control, as delineated in the organisational boundaries.
The Group has made a concerted effort to collect 
inf
ormation on utilities and waste consumption at its 
properties, including tenant fully controlled areas. Some 
tenant-controlled areas are still left out, due to insufficient 
data. The Group plans to continue to increase the 
c
overage of the information reported, thus demonstrating 
commitment to sustainability, environmental and energy 
performance, both on the portfolio and corporate level. 
In the meantime, for calculation of intensity factors, those 
areas fully controlled by tenants, where the Group was 
not yet able to have reliable data, were excluded both 
from consumption and from the gross floor area, and was 
es
timated as presented below.
The consumption reported includes all utilities that the 
C
ompany purchased as landlord (i.e. those consumed in 
the common areas and those consumed in the tenants 
areas for which NEPI Rockcastle is responsible for 
sourcing and tracking). There are still some limited cases 
where the Group does not have access to tenant managed 
utilities and these represent the following % calculated 
based on total areas:
• 6% for electricity
• 5% for fuel
• 1% for district heating
Based on the available tenant data and Company’s 
es
timations, total energy not covered and managed by the 
tenants is approximately 65,000MWh.
Water (both tap and groundwater) is covered 100% by 
landlor
d reporting.

BREEAM Certification KPI is calculated for the whole 
portfolio, excluding retail parks and industrial. This 
indicator covers therefore 97% of the portfolio by area.
In some assets, where the waste is being tracked in m3 
based on local practices, a reconversion rate to metric 
tons (as required by reporting standards) was used, 
as f

• 0.35 for compressed waste
• 0.15 for non-compressed waste

• Most of the changes are due to the addition of 3 
pr
operties to the Company’s portfolio in the end of 
2022 (Forum Gdansk Shopping Center, Copernicus 
Shopping Centre and Ploiesti Shopping City). To allow 
proper comparability, data was diligently collected and 
incorporated spanning previous years for those three 
properties and is included in the above tables

Boundaries
As described on page 229.
Normalisation
NEPI Rockcastle has normalised its data by using gross 
floor
 area (adjusted with GLA tenant controlled for 
which data is not fully collected from tenants yet) and 
number of visitors as denominators. This means that, for 
example, energy intensity is calculated per m2  and per 
1,
000 visitors.
Gross floor area covers built area including underground, 
t
echnical spaces, terraces, and multilevel parking. Exterior 
parking area was not included.
Segmentation
Data on environmental and energy performance has 
been br
oken down based on property type (retail, office, 
industrial), as well as the nine different countries where 
NEPI Rockcastle operates.

Scope 1 emissions
Refer to direct greenhouse gas emissions that occur from sources that are 
o
wned or controlled by an entity, such as emissions from combustion of fuels in 
owned or controlled boilers, and other equipment. These emissions are typically 
accounted for within an organisation's operational boundaries and are considered 
part of their carbon footprint.
Scope 2 emissions
Refer to indirect greenhouse gas emissions associated with the generation of 
electricity
, heating, cooling, or acquired by an organisation. These emissions 
occur from the generation of electricity and heat off-site, but are consumed 
b
y the organisation. They are considered indirect because they are not 
emitted directly by the organisation's own operations but are a result of the 
organisation's energy consumption.
Scope 3 emissions
Scope 3 emissions refer to all indirect greenhouse gas emissions that occur in 
the v
alue chain of an organisation, including both upstream and downstream 
activities that are not included in Scope 1 or Scope 2 emissions. These emissions 
are associated with sources such as purchased goods and services, business 
travel, employee commuting, waste disposal, and other activities related to the 
organisation's operations but occurring outside its direct control and involve a 
wide range of activities across the entire value chain.
Transitional risk Business risk posed by regulatory and policy changes implemented to tackle 
clima
te change.

In preparing the Financial Statements, the Directors are responsible for:
• selecting suitable accounting policies and then applying them consistently;
• stating whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs;
• making judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
• preparing the Financial Statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group 
and the C
ompany will continue in business.
Each of the directors, whose names are stated below, hereby confirm that:
• the annual Financial Statements set out on pages 248 to 315 fairly present in all material respects the financial 
position, financial performance and cash flows of the issuer in terms of IFRS;
• to the best of our knowledge and belief, no facts have been omitted or untrue statements made that would make the 
annual financial statements false or misleading;
• internal financial controls have been put in place to ensure that material information relating to the issuer and its 
consolidated subsidiaries have been provided to effectively prepare the financial statements of the issuer;
• the internal financial controls are adequate and effective and can be relied upon in compiling the annual financial 
statements, having fulfilled our role and function as executive directors with primary responsibility for implementation 
and execution of controls;
• where we are not satisfied, we have disclosed to the audit committee and the auditors any deficiencies in design and 
oper
ational effectiveness of the internal financial controls and have taken steps to remedy the deficiencies; and
• we are not aware of any fraud involving directors.
With reference to Section 5:25c paragraph 2, sub c of the Financial Markets Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel 
toezicht), the Board declares that to the best of its knowledge:
• The financial statements provide a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of 
NEPI R
ockcastle N.V. and of the companies included in the consolidation taken as a whole;
• The directors' report provides a true and fair view of the situation on the balance sheet date and of the developments 
during the financial year of NEPI Rockcastle N.V. and of its affiliated companies whose information has been included 
in the financial statements, together with a description of the main risks NEPI Rockcastle N.V. faces.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s 
tr
ansactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and the Company. 
T
hey are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on 
the Gr
oup’s website.
The Financial Statements on pages 248 to 315 were approved by the Board of Directors on 19 March 2024, authorised for

Notes to the Consolidated 
Financial S
tatements
1.  GENERAL
NEPI Rockcastle N.V. (“the Company”, “NEPI Rockcastle”, “the Group”) is a public limited company domiciled in the 
Netherlands, ha
ving its registered office at Strawinskylaan 563, WTC Zuidas, Tower Ten, 5th Floor, 1077 XX Amsterdam, 
with r
egistration number at the Dutch Chamber of Commerce 87488329. The Company’s shares are listed on the Main 
Board of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange Limited (“JSE”), Euronext Amsterdam and A2X. NEPI Rockcastle is the 
premier owner and operator of shopping centres in Central and Eastern Europe (“CEE”). The Group benefits from a 
highly
-skilled internal management team which combines asset management, development, investment, leasing and 
financial expertise.
The Company was incorporated in the Isle of Man on 1 December 2016. On 29 November 2021, the Board of Directors 
(the “Boar
d”) approved the migration of NEPI Rockcastle from the Isle of Man to the Netherlands, via an initial migration 
to Luxembourg (together, the “Migration”). Structured in this way, the migration of the Company to the Netherlands 
ensured the corporate continuity of NEPI Rockcastle and the trading in Group shares, which remain available to be traded 
on the JSE, Euronext Amsterdam and A2X. On 
10 May 2022, the Migration was approved by the shareholders of the 
C
ompany. As a result, following fulfilment of certain conditions precedent, the Group has, with effect from 6 September 
2022, established its registered office and place of effective management and central administration in the Netherlands 
as a public limit
ed liability company.
The Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements and the Company’s Separate Financial Statements are collectively 
r
eferred to as the Financial Statements. The Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 were approved 
b
y the Board of Directors on 19 March 2024 and authorised for publication on 20 March 2024.
2.  BASIS OF PREPARATION
a. Statement of compliance
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been consistently prepared in accordance with International Financial 
R
eporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’), the SAICA Financial 
Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee, Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial 
Reporting Standards Council, the JSE Listings Requirements, International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as 
adopted by the European Union and with Title 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. They comprise the Company and its 
subsidiaries, as detailed in “Basis of consolidation” in Note 3.2.
The material accounting policies applied in the preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements are set out below 
in Not
e 3 and are consistent with those applied for the preparation of the annual Consolidated Financial Statements 
as a
t 31 December 2022, except for the new mandatory standards and interpretations effective as of 1 January 2023, 
described below:
• IFRS 17 insurance contracts
• IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice Statement 2: Disclosure of Accounting 
policies (Amendments
)
• IAS 8 Accounting policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: Definition of Accounting 
Es
timates (Amendments)
• IAS 12 Income taxes: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments)
• International Tax Reform Pillar Two Model Rules (Amendments to IAS 12)
These standards, amendments and interpretations did not have a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial 
Statements as at 31 December 2023, except as indicated below:
• IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice Statement 2: Disclosure of Accounting 
policies (Amendments)
The Amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. The amendments provide 
guidance on the application of materiality judgements to accounting policy disclosures. In particular, the amendments 
to IAS 1 replace the requirement to disclose ‘significant’ accounting policies with a requirement to disclose ‘material’ 
ac
counting policies. Also, guidance and illustrative examples are added in the Practice Statement to assist in the 
application of the materiality concept when making judgements about accounting policy disclosures. The Group revisited 
the accounting policy information disclosures to ensure compliance with the amended standard. The amendments 
have had an impact on the Group’s disclosures of accounting policies, but not on the measurement, recognition or 
presentation of any items in the Group’s financial statements.
• IAS 12 Income taxes: International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules (Amendments)
The amendments are effective immediately upon issuance, but certain disclosure requirements are effective later. The 
Or
ganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) published the Pillar Two Model Rules in December 
2021 to ensure that large multinational companies would be subject to a minimum 15% tax rate. On 23 May 2023, the 
IA
SB issued International Tax Reform—Pillar Two Model Rules – Amendments to IAS 12. The amendments introduce a 
mandatory temporary exception to the accounting for deferred taxes arising from the jurisdictional implementation of 
the Pillar Two Model Rules and disclosure requirements for affected entities on the potential exposure to Pillar Two 
inc
ome taxes. The Amendments require, for periods in which Pillar Two legislation is (substantively) enacted but not yet 
252 NEPI R ockcastle N.V.

Page 253:
effective, disclosure of known or reasonably estimable information that helps users of financial statements understand 
the entity’
s exposure arising from Pillar Two income taxes. To comply with these requirements, an entity is required to 
disclose qualitative and quantitative information about its exposure to Pillar Two income taxes at the end of the reporting 
period. The disclosure of the current tax expense related to Pillar Two income taxes and the disclosures in relation to 
periods before the legislation is effective are required for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023, 
but ar
e not required for any interim period ending on or before 31 December 2023. Pillar Two legislation has been 
enact
ed or substantively enacted in certain jurisdictions in which the Group operates. However, this legislation does not 
apply to the Group as its consolidated revenue has not been higher than €750 million for two consecutive years.
Management has prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis. Having considered the potential impact 
of the military conflict in Ukraine and the overall macroeconomic environment on the Company’s and the wider NEPI 
Rockcastle Group revenues, profits, cash flows, operations, liquidity position and debt facilities, management concluded 
tha
t despite the market events generated by these circumstances during 2023 and subsequent to the year-end, there are 
no material uncertainties relating to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Climate related matters
Climate change has a major impact on the economy, requiring increasing awareness of its consequences on the financial 
and non-financial performance of companies. Climate-related matters aspects have also become increasingly important 
for the real estate industry. The Group’s strategy is based on adopting climate-resilient activities and on reducing the 
carbon emissions resulting from its operations.
NEPI Rockcastle aims to contribute to a more sustainable environment by reducing the carbon footprint of its 
buildings, meeting s
tringent green building standards for new constructions, redevelopment, refurbishment projects and 
integrating the renewable energy production in the core of NEPI Rockcastle’s business strategy.
A carbon reduction pathway has been established and is endorsed by the Board of Directors, encompassing 
de
velopment and redevelopment, operations, engagement with key stakeholders, management of own offices and 
emplo
yees’ business travel. The carbon pathway outlines how NEPI Rockcastle plans to reduce its greenhouse gas 
emissions and reach its climate goals of reducing operations carbon footprint by 70% and embedded carbon by 30% by 
2030. This serves as a roadmap for transitioning the organization and the assets portfolio to a low-carbon economy.
The implementation of these initiatives has an impact on the Group’s financial statements, mainly through its 
in
vestment strategy and the implementation of costs incurred with the aim to address sustainability related targets and 
environmental challenges.
Valuation of investment properties
The value of investment properties is positively impacted by the certification of all of Group’s shopping malls with 
the Building R
esearch Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) In-Use certificates, attesting their 
r
ecognition as environmentally friendly.
In addition, the Group incurred capital expenditure aimed to anticipate regulatory developments and adapt to changes 
in demand f
or more sustainable spaces. These investments include, among others, installation of LED technology in 
lighting systems, installation of more efficient air-conditioning systems, the implementation of smart systems such as 
met
ering and high-performance building management systems, which are meant to enable collecting data from the 
assets, facilitating decisions on modernization, retrofitting or adjustments to the equipment parameters.
During 2023, NEPI Rockcastle accelerated the installation of photovoltaic panels in Romania, with 35MW of power-
gener
ating capacity being installed in 27 properties, covering approximately 25% of those properties’ consumption 
needs. Following the successful roll-out in Romania, management is assessing the opportunity to expand the 
development of photovoltaic plants in other geographies.
The above information was provided to and was considered by the Group’s appraisers in their valuation process.
Funding activity
In 2023, The Group has launched its Sustainability-Linked Finance Framework (the “Framework”) as an alternative green 
funding appr
oach, the new IFC loan concluded in December 2023 and the revolving facilities extended in December 
2023 and February 2024 were based on this ambitious framework. The Framework can be applied for bilateral financing 
agreements such as Sustainability-Linked term loans, revolving credit facilities, etc.
As disclosed in Note 18, in December 2023, NEPI Rockcastle entered into a €387 million green financing agreement with 
IF
C, a member of the World Bank Group and the largest global development institution focused on the private sector in 
emerging markets. The senior unsecured facility is structured as a green loan with sustainability-linked features, aimed at 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing energy efficiency in the Group’s property portfolio. The funding has 
been secured at competitive pricing in the current market conditions, with reference to the Euribor rate. The Group also 
extended a sustainability-linked €150 million revolving credit facility (RCF) with Deutsche Bank, Citi, and HSBC, during 
December 2023.
Under the previously published Green Finance Framework, NEPI Rockcastle has issued €1 billion green bonds. The 
Gr
oup has committed to use proceeds from green bonds to finance or refinance existing and future projects which 
impr
ove the environmental performance of the Group’s property portfolio, which translate into allocating all resources 
to environmentally sustainable assets (buildings certified as BREEAM “excellent” or “very good”). Going forward, both

newly issued and currently outstanding bonds will be governed under the updated framework, with allocation to a single 
portf
olio of assets, in alignment with the more rigorous eligibility criteria in the framework.
b. Basis of measurement
The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for investment property in use, 
land f
or investment property under development, and interest rate derivatives, which are measured at fair value.
c. Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make 
judgements, es
timates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities, inc
ome and expenses. Estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and other factors 
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and enable judgements to be made about the carrying values of 
assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates 
and underlying as
sumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period when the estimate is revised and future periods if applicable.
d. Presentation
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in thousands of Euros (“€’000s”), rounded off to the nearest 
thousand, unles
s stated otherwise.
3.  MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The material accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all periods presented.
3.1 Foreign currency translation
a. Functional and presentation currency
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Euro (“€”, “EUR”) thousands unless otherwise stated, which 
is NEPI R
ockcastle’s functional and presentation currency. The assessment of the functional currency of the Group is 
presented in Note 4 – Significant Accounting Estimates and Judgements in Applying Accounting Policies.
b. Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates 
of the tr
ansactions or valuation where items are re‑measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the 
settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year‑end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss.
3.2 Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
The Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of the 
C
ompany and its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are all entities controlled by the Company. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the 
C
onsolidated Financial Statements from the date the control commences until the date the control ceases.
These Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and the fully consolidated subsidiaries, as set out below:

3.3 Investment property in use
Investment property is held to earn rental income, capital appreciation or both.
The cost of investment property acquired by any other means than a business combination consists of the purchase price 
and dir
ectly attributable expenditure.
Subsequent expenditure relating to investment property is capitalised when future economic benefits from the use of the 
as
set are probable and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other subsequent expenditure is recognised as 
an expense during the period it is incurred.
After initial recognition, investment property in use is measured at fair value. Fair value is determined semi-annually by 
e
xternal, independent professional valuers, with appropriate and recognised qualifications and recent experience in the 
loca
tion and category of property being valued. Valuations are based on the income method, respectively, the applied 
method used for all investment property in use is discounted cash flow (“DCF”).
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values are included in the Statement of comprehensive income for the 
period during which the
y arise. Unrealised gains or losses, net of deferred tax, are non-distributable.
Lease incentives, such as rent-free periods, discounts during the lease or payment of fit-out works for the benefit of 
the t
enants, are part of value of the investment property and are straight-lined over the lease term. The lease term 
corresponds to the contractual duration for the majority of the leases, except for the anchor tenants, for which the lease 
duration is assessed by the Group based on past experience and taking into account factors such as: GLA of the property 
where the anchor tenant is located, catchment area, dominance/competition in the catchment area or purchasing power.
3.4 Investment property under development
Property that is being constructed or developed for future use as investment property is classified as investment 
pr
operty under development and carried at cost until construction or development is complete, or its fair value can 
be reliably determined.
The land on which investment property is constructed or developed is carried at fair value, which is determined 
semi-annually b
y external, independent professional valuers, with appropriate and recognised qualifications and recent 
e
xperience in the location and category of property being valued. Valuations are performed using the market comparable 
approach or residual approach.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values are included in the Statement of comprehensive income during the 
period when the
y arise. Unrealised gains or losses, net of deferred tax, are non-distributable.
3.5 Assets classified as held for sale
An investment property or a group of assets including an investment property (disposal group) are classified as held for 
sale if their carrying amount will be r
ecovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. For this to 
be the case:
• the assets must be available for immediate sale in their present condition;
• the Group must be committed to sell;
• there must be a plan to locate a buyer; and
• it is highly probable that a sale will be completed within one year from the date of classification. 
On re-classification as held for sale, investment property that is measured at fair value continues to be measured in 
this way.
An investment property or disposal group classified as held for sale is presented separately in the Statement of financial 
position as assets or liabilities classified as held for sale.
3.6 Goodwill
Goodwill arises upon business combination and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the Group’s 
int
erest in net fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities of the acquiree.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash-
gener
ating units (“CGUs”), or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each 
unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the Group at which the 
goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and it is represented by the individual properties.
3.7 Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that are subject to depreciation or amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in 
cir
cumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Non‑financial assets, other than goodwill and 
intangible as
sets with infinitive useful life, that have suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the 
impairment a
t each reporting date, if indicators of reversal exist.

3.8 Financial assets
3.8.1 Classification
 
In line with IFRS 9 “Financial instruments”, the Group classifies its financial assets in the following 
measur
ement categories:
• those to be measured subsequently at fair value through profit or loss; and
• those to be measured at amortised cost.
The classification and subsequent measurement of debt instruments financial assets depends on: (i) the Group’s business 
model f
or managing the related assets portfolio and (ii) the cash flow characteristics of the asset.
For financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”), gains and losses are recorded in profit or loss.
3.8.2 Recognition and derecognition
 
All purchases and sales of financial assets that require delivery within the time frame established by regulation or market 
c
onvention (“regular way” purchases and sales) are recorded at trade date, which is the date when the Group commits 
to deliver a financial instrument. All other purchases and sales are recognized when the entity becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have 
been tr
ansferred and the Group have transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
3.8.3 Measurement
 
At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not 
a
t FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of 
financial assets carried at FVTPL are expensed in profit or loss. Fair value at initial recognition is best evidenced by the 
tr
ansaction price.
a. Debt instruments
Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group’s business model for managing the asset and the 
cash flow characteristics of the asset: assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash 
flows represent solely payments of principal and interest (“SPPI”) are measured at amortised cost. Any gain or loss 
arising on derecognition is recognised directly in profit or loss. Impairment losses are presented as separate line item in 
the S
tatement of comprehensive income. Financial assets measured at amortised cost (“AC”) comprise cash and cash 
equivalents, loans to participants in the Share Purchase Scheme, long term receivables and trade and other receivables 
(excluding prepaid expenses).
b. Derivatives
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into, and they are 
subsequently r
emeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period.
3.8.4 Impairment – credit loss allowance for Expected Credit Losses (“ECL”)
 
In line with IFRS 9 “Financial instruments”, the Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the ECL for debt instruments 
(including loans
) measured at amortised cost. The Group measures ECL and recognises credit loss allowance on an 
annual basis. The measurement of ECL reflects: (i) an unbiased and probability weighted amount that is determined by 
evaluating a range of possible outcomes, (ii) time value of money and (iii) all reasonable and supportable information 
that is available without undue cost and effort at the end of each reporting period about past events, current conditions 
and f
orecasts of future conditions.
The carrying amount of the financial assets is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of any 
loss is recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income (profit or loss). Debt instruments measured at amortised 
c
ost are presented in the balance sheet net of the allowance for ECL.
ECLs are recognised for loans granted in two stages. For credit exposures for which there has not been a significant 
increase in credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are 
pos
sible within the next 12-months (a 12-month ECL). For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant 
increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining 
lif
e of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (a lifetime ECL).
Expected credit losses for trade receivables are recognised using the simplified approach. Therefore, the Group does not 
tr
ack changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date.
3.8.5 Reclassification
 
Financial instruments are reclassified only when the business model for managing those assets changes. The 
reclassification has a prospective effect and takes place from the start of the first reporting period following the change.
3.8.6 Write-off
 
Financial assets are written-off, in whole or in part, when the Group has exhausted all practical recovery efforts and has 
c
oncluded that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The write-off represents a derecognition event. Indicators 
258 NEPI R ockcastle N.V.

Page 259:
that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, among others, insolvency or significant financial difficulties 
of the tenant, default on payment terms and vacation or abandonment of the leased premises. Impaired trade and other 
r
eceivables are derecognised when all reasonable efforts to collect the amounts outstanding have failed and they are 
assessed as uncollectable.
3.8.7 Modification
 
The Group sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual terms of the financial assets. The Group 
as
sesses whether the modification of contractual cash flows is substantial considering, among other, the following 
f
actors: new contractual terms that substantially affect the risk profile of the asset, significant change in interest rate, 
change in the c
urrency denomination.
If the modified terms are substantially different, the rights to cash flows from the original asset expire and the Group 
der
ecognises the original financial asset and recognises a new asset at its fair value. The date of renegotiation is 
c
onsidered to be the date of initial recognition for subsequent impairment calculation purposes, including determining 
whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred. The Company also assesses whether the new loan or debt 
instrument meets the SPPI criterion. Any difference between the carrying amount of the original asset derecognised and 
f
air value of the new substantially modified asset is recognised in profit or loss, unless the substance of the difference is 
a
ttributed to a capital transaction with owners.
In a situation where the renegotiation was driven by financial difficulties of the counterparty and inability to make the 
originally agreed payments, the Company compares the original and revised expected cash flows to assess whether 
the risk
s and rewards of the asset are substantially different as a result of the contractual modification. If the risks and 
r
ewards do not change, the modified asset is not substantially different from the original asset and the modification 
does not result in derecognition. The Company recalculates the gross carrying amount by discounting the modified 
contractual cash flows by the original effective interest rate and recognises a modification gain or loss in profit or loss.
Specific valuation techniques used to value financial assets include:
• The use of quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments (for financial assets/liabilities at fair value 
thr
ough profit or loss);
• Discounted cash flow analysis (for the remaining financial instruments).
3.9 Financial liabilities – measurement categories
Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and classified and subsequently measured at amortised cost, 
e
xcept for financial liabilities at FVTPL: this classification is applied to interest rate derivatives and other financial 
liabilities designated as such at initial recognition.
3.10 Borrowings (bonds and bank loans)
Borrowings are recognised initially at the fair value of the liability (determined using the prevailing market rate of 
int
erest if significantly different from the transaction price) and net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, 
borr
owings are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Any difference between the 
pr
oceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in Statement of comprehensive income over 
the period of the borrowings, using the effective interest method, unless they are directly attributable to the acquisition, 
c
onstruction or production of a qualifying asset, in which case they are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset. 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities, unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the 
liability f
or at least twelve months after the balance sheet date.
Borrowings are removed from the balance sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is extinguished (i.e. 
dischar
ged, cancelled or expires). The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been 
e
xtinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or 
liabilities assumed, is recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income.
An exchange between the Group and its original lenders of debt instruments with substantially different terms, as 
w
ell as substantial modifications of the terms and conditions of existing financial liabilities, are accounted for as an 
e
xtinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. The terms are substantially 
different if the discounted present value of the cash flows under the new terms, including any fees paid net of any fees 
received and discounted using the original effective interest rate, is at least 10% different from the discounted present 
v
alue of the remaining cash flows of the original financial liability. In addition, other qualitative factors, such as the 
currency that the instrument is denominated in, changes in the type of interest rate, new conversion features attached to 
the instrument and change in loan covenants are also considered.
If an exchange of debt instruments or modification of terms is accounted for as an extinguishment, any costs or fees 
inc
urred are recognised as part of the gain or loss on the extinguishment. If the exchange or modification is not 
ac
counted for as an extinguishment, any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the liability and are 
amortised over the remaining term of the modified liability.
Modifications of liabilities that do not result in extinguishment are accounted for as a change in estimate using a 
cumulative catch-up method, with any gain or loss recognised in Statement of comprehensive income.
Borrowing costs are interest and other costs that the Group incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds, including 
int
erest on borrowings, amortisation of discounts or premiums relating to borrowings and amortisation of ancillary costs 
incurred in connection with the arrangement of borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as an adjustment to 
interest costs.
Annual Report 2023 25 9

Page 260:
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, being 
an as
set that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use (such as properties 
developed for future sale, capital appreciation or rental income) are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset, when it is 
probable that they will result in future economic benefits to the Group and the costs can be measured reliably.
3.11 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash balances, cash deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments with original 
ma
turities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an 
insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at amortised cost because: (i) they are held 
for collection of contractual cash flows and those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI), 
and (ii) the
y are not designated at FVTPL.
3.12 Trade receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for rental and service charge income from tenants in the ordinary 
c
ourse of business. If collection is expected in one year or less, they are classified as current assets. If not, they are 
pr
esented as non-current assets.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value, generally at the amount of consideration that is unconditional. The 
Gr
oup holds the trade receivables with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows and therefore measures them 
subsequently a
t amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Trade receivables are also subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9. The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified 
approach to measuring expected credit losses.
Trade receivables are written-off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators that there is no 
reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others, the failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment plan with 
the Group.
3.13 Inventory property
Property acquired or being constructed for sale in the ordinary course of business, rather than to be held for rental or 
capital appr
eciation, is held as inventory property and is measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value (“NRV”). 
Principally, this is residential property that the Group develops and intends to sell on completion of development.
The commencement of development with a plan or a prior agreement to sell represents a change in use and accordingly 
the pr
oject is transferred from investment property to inventory property.
Costs incurred in inventory property include:
• freehold and leasehold rights for land;
• amounts paid to contractors for development; and
• planning and design costs, costs of site preparation, professional fees for legal services, property transfer taxes, 
de
velopment overheads and other related costs.
NRV is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, based on market prices at the reporting date, less 
es
timated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
When an inventory property is sold, the carrying amount of the property is recognised as an expense in the period 
in which the r
elated revenue is recognised. The carrying amount of inventory property recognised in profit or loss is 
det
ermined with reference to the directly attributable costs incurred on the property sold and an allocation of any other 
related costs based on the relative size of the property sold.
3.14 Share capital and share premium
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental external costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are 
sho
wn in equity as a deduction from the proceeds.
The consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes for the purchases 
of the C
ompany’s equity instruments by any of the Group’s subsidiaries, as a result of a share buy-back or for a 
share-based incentive plan) is presented within “Other reserves”, until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such 
ordinary shares are cancelled, their nominal value is debited to Share capital, with the corresponding difference up to 
their pur
chase price (including any attributable incremental cost, net of taxes) debited from Share premium. Where 
such ordinary shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental 
transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the owners of the Group. 
Usually
, shares are purchased for the debt-free Long-Term Share Incentive Plan (Note 3.15 (b)).
3.15 Share-based payments
To date, NEPI Rockcastle has initiated two types of incentive programs that offered share-based payments in exchange 
f
or services provided to it by its directors and employees (equity-settled transactions), which are detailed below.
260 NEPI R ockcastle N.V.

Page 261:
a. Purchase Offers with a vesting component – Share Purchase Scheme (“NRP SPS”)
This program was put in place before the 2017 merger of the former groups New Europe Property Investments plc 
(“NEPI”) and R
ockcastle Global Real Estate Company Ltd (“Rockcastle”). Under this program, participants were granted 
loans to acquire shares in the Company at fair value at the grant date. These loans were classified as “loans to 
participants in the inc
entive plan” and included in Other long-term assets (Note 10). The loans are carried at amortised 
c
ost and the accrued interest is recognised as finance income in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. The costs 
under this pr
ogram are nil.
b. Debt free Long-Term Share Incentive Plan with a vesting component (“LTSIP”)
This program was put in place after the 2017 merger of the former groups NEPI and Rockcastle. Under this incentive plan, 
shar
es may be issued by the Group to executive directors and other key personnel for no cash consideration. Awards 
under this plan are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and are based on the performance of the Group and the 
employees. The costs related to the LTSIP are measured based on the fair value of the shares at the grant date and are 
recognized over the vesting period.
The costs are presented as part of the Administrative expenses in the Statement of comprehensive income and within 
Other r
eserves in the Statement of changes in equity.
3.16 Accumulated profit
The balance on the Statement of comprehensive income is transferred to accumulated profit at the end of each financial 
period. Distributions paid in cash are deducted from accumulated profit. Distributions for which shareholders elected to 
r
eceive a return of capital are accounted for as an issue of share capital with a corresponding deduction from the share 
premium account.
3.17 Revenue
Revenue is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue comprises rental and related 
inc
ome and recovery of expenses, excluding VAT.
Rental income
Rental income receivable from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the duration of the lease, 
e
xcept for variable lease payments which are recognized when they arise.
Contractually agreed and signed concessions granted to, and obtained from, tenants are treated according to IFRS 16 
“L
eases”. IFRS 16 defines “lease modification” as a change in scope, or consideration, of the lease, not part of the original 
t
erms and conditions, such as rent discounts, lease extensions, increase in variable rent (overage/turnover), introduction 
of break options, etc. Lease modifications are recognised prospectively over the new lease term and accounted for by 
the Group from the date the modification is contractually agreed and signed by both parties. Agreed lease modifications 
are recognised as lease incentives from the date the modification was signed. Such modifications are straight-lined over 
the ne
w lease term and recognised in the Consolidated Statement of comprehensive income as a reduction of Gross 
rental income.
Service charges income from tenants
Revenue from service and property management charges is recognised in the accounting period in which control of the 
servic
es are passed to the customer, which is when the service is rendered. For certain service contracts, revenue is 
recognised based on the actual service provided to the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services.
As specified in the lease agreements, the Group has the primary responsibility for providing services to tenants 
(electricity, water and gas utilities, interior and exterior cleaning, security, maintenance, repairs, etc). The Group has 
determined that these services constitute distinct non-lease components (transferred separately from the right to use 
the underlying asset) and are within the scope of IFRS 15. The Group allocates the consideration in the contract to 
the separate lease and revenue (non-lease) components on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. In respect of the 
revenue component, these services represent a series of daily services that are individually satisfied over time because 
the t
enants simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by the Group. The Group applies the time elapsed 
method t
o measure progress.
The Group negotiates directly with the suppliers all contracts for services provided to tenants. These contracts are 
c
oncluded between the Group subsidiaries which own the properties and the direct supplier. As the Group sometimes 
uses the same providers for services across most of its portfolio, it can negotiate better prices through the economies of 
scale. The Group is considered principal in these transactions, in terms of the IFRS 15 requirements.
The Group negotiates and pays all expenses incurred by the tenants and then re-invoices these costs to them as defined 
in the contractual clauses included in the lease agreements. A flat fee is charged monthly during the year. This fee is 
es
timated based on the previous year’s actual costs, with an annual service charge reconciliation performed based on 
current year’s actual costs incurred by the Group. For contracts terminated during the year, the Group estimates the 
service charge to be collected based on the current budget and last year’s actual costs.
Revenue from sales of residential property
Revenue is recognised when the performance obligation associated with the sale is completed. The transaction price 
c
omprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of value added tax, rebates and discounts.
The sale of completed property constitutes a single performance obligation and the Group has determined that this 
is satisfied at the point in time when control transfers. The Group’s sales contracts qualify as unconditional exchange 
of contracts, which occurs when legal title transfers to the customer. Payments are usually received on the date when 
contracts are signed or with several days delay.
Annual Report 2023 26 1

3.18 Property operating and administrative expenses
Property operating expenses and administrative expenses are recognised on an accrual basis.
3.19 Earnings distribution
A distribution is recorded as a liability and deducted from equity in the period in which it is declared and approved. Any 
dis
tribution declared after the reporting period and before the financial statements are authorised for issue is disclosed 
in Not
e 16.
3.20 Taxation
Taxation on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Current income tax and liabilities are 
measur
ed at the amount expected to be recovered from, or paid to, taxation authorities. Management periodically 
evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to 
interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.
Deferred tax is determined using the liability method and is based on temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of as
sets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their tax bases.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes; the initial recognition 
of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in 
subsidiaries tha
t are unlikely to reverse in the foreseeable future.
A deferred tax asset is recognised based on the assumption that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available 
against which it can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the 
related tax benefit will be realised.
The current tax expense incurred by the Group reflects tax accrued in the subsidiaries of the Group located in Bulgaria, 
Cr
oatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and the Netherlands.
3.21 Segment reporting
In accordance with IFRS 8, operating segments are identified on the basis of the internal reporting used by management 
when e
valuating performance and allocating resources.
The Group has a homogeneous asset base (real estate properties), with similar economic characteristics, which provide 
similar na
ture of services, i.e. leasing of its properties, that generate rental income.
The Group’s Chief Operating Decision Makers (CODM) are the executive directors, and they take decisions based on 
detailed r
eports. These are prepared regularly and are presented to the Board of Directors, which approves the results 
and gives guidance on the subsequent strategy to be undertaken.
In particular, the financial information in respect of investment property is provided to the Board of Directors focuses 
primarily on net r
entals (including rental income, service charge income and property operating expenses) and valuation 
gains and losses.
The operating segments for management purposes are the individual properties. For reporting purposes, the Group 
aggr
egates the retail properties (shopping malls and retail centres) on country level and presents the financial 
information on the following geographic reportable segments: Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Lithuania, 
P
oland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia.
In addition, the Group’s CODM closely follow changes in distributable earnings to its shareholders as a measure of 
profitability and as a result of successful implementation of the Group’s strategy. Distributable earnings per share is 
calculated in terms of the SA REIT Association’s Best Practice Recommendations Second Edition.
3.22 Investment property acquisitions and business combinations
The Group acquires subsidiaries that own real estate. At the time of acquisition, the Group considers whether each 
ac
quisition represents the acquisition of a business or the acquisition of an asset. The Group accounts for an acquisition 
as a business combination where an integrated set of activities and assets, including property, is acquired. More 
specifically the following criteria, which indicate an acquisition of a business, are considered: the number of properties 
ac
quired, the extent to which strategic management processes and operation processes are acquired and the complexity 
of the processes acquired. In line with amended IFRS 3 since 1 January 2020 the Group may also apply optional 
c
oncentration test.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. When the acquisition of subsidiaries does not 
r
epresent a business combination, it is accounted for as an acquisition of a group of assets and liabilities. The cost of 
the acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based upon their relative fair values, and no goodwill or 
deferred tax is recognised.
Transactions with non-controlling interests, where control is maintained, are accounted for as transactions within equity. 
An
y difference between the amount of the adjustment to non-controlling interests and any consideration paid or 
r
eceived is recognised in the accumulated profit reserve.

3.23 Leases where the Group is a lessee
The Group recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use 
the underlying as
sets for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises 
right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use).
Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-
of-use as
sets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised and lease payments made at or before the 
commencement date.
Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease 
pa
yments include fixed payments. The present value of lease payments is recognised by discounting the contractual 
lease pa
yments using the interest rate implicit in the lease, representing the rate that the lessee would have to pay to 
borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment 
with similar terms, security and conditions.
3.24 Standards issued but not yet effective and not early adopted
Certain new accounting standards, amendments to accounting standards and interpretations have been published that 
ar
e not mandatory for 31 December 2023 reporting periods and have not been early adopted by the Group.
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (Amendments)
The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024, with earlier application 
permitted, and will need to be applied retrospectively in accordance with IAS 8. The objective of the amendments is 
to clarify the principles in IAS 1 for the classification of liabilities as either current or non-current. The amendments 
clarify the meaning of a right t
o defer settlement, the requirement for this right to exist at the end of the reporting 
period, that management intent does not affect current or non-current classification, that options by the counterparty 
tha
t could result in settlement by the transfer of the entity’s own equity instruments do not affect current or non-current 
classification. Also, the amendments specify that only covenants with which an entity must comply on or before the 
reporting date will affect a liability’s classification. Additional disclosures are also required for non-current liabilities 
arising fr
om loan arrangements that are subject to covenants to be complied with within twelve months after the 
reporting period. The amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU. The Group is currently assessing the impact 
the amendments will have on current practice and whether existing loan agreements may require renegotiation.
IFRS 16 Leases: Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (amendments)
The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024, with earlier application 
permitt
ed. The amendments are intended to improve the requirements that a seller-lessee uses in measuring the lease 
liability arising in a sale and leaseback transaction in IFRS 16, while it does not change the accounting for leases unrelated 
to sale and leaseback transactions. In particular, the seller-lessee determines ‘lease payments’ or ‘revised lease payments’ 
in such a way that the seller-lessee would not recognise any amount of the gain or loss that relates to the right of use it 
retains. Applying these requirements does not prevent the seller-lessee from recognising, in profit or loss, any gain or loss 
r
elating to the partial or full termination of a lease. A seller-lessee applies the amendment retrospectively in accordance 
with IAS 8 to sale and leaseback transactions entered into after the date of initial application, being the beginning of the 
annual reporting period in which an entity 
first applied IFRS 16. The amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU. 
This amendment is not expected to have a material impact on the Group.
Amendment in IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures: 
Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture
The amendments address an acknowledged inconsistency between the requirements in IFRS 10 and those in IAS 28, 
in dealing with the sale or c
ontribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture. The main 
consequence of the amendments is that a full gain or loss is recognized when a transaction involves a business (whether 
it is housed in a subsidiary or not). A partial gain or loss is recognized when a transaction involves assets that do 
not constitute a business, even if these assets are housed in a subsidiary. In December 2015 the IASB postponed the 
effective date of this amendment indefinitely pending the outcome of its research project on the equity method of 
ac
counting. The amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU. The Group is currently assessing the impact of 
the amendments.
IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments Disclosure - Supplier Finance 
Arrangements (Amendments)
The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024, with earlier application 
permitt
ed. The amendments supplement requirements already in IFRS and require an entity to disclose the terms and 
conditions of supplier finance arrangements. Additionally, entities are required to disclose at the beginning and end of 
r
eporting period the carrying amounts of supplier finance arrangement financial liabilities and the line items in which 
those liabilities ar
e presented as well as the carrying amounts of financial liabilities and line items, for which the finance 
providers have already settled the corresponding trade payables. Entities should also disclose the type and effect of 
non-cash changes in the carrying amounts of supplier finance arrangement financial liabilities, which prevent the carrying 
amounts of the financial liabilities from being comparable. Furthermore, the amendments require an entity to disclose at 
the beginning and end of the reporting period the range of payment due dates for financial liabilities owed to the finance 
providers and for comparable trade payables that are not part of those arrangements. The amendments have not yet 
been endorsed b
y the EU. Management does not expect that the adoption of these amendments will have a significant 
impact on the Group’s financial statements.

IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates: Lack of Exchangeability (Amendments)
The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2025, with earlier application 
permitted. The amendments specify how an entity should assess whether a currency is exchangeable and how it should 
determine a spot exchange rate when exchangeability is lacking. A currency is considered to be exchangeable into 
another currency when an entity is able to obtain the other currency within a time frame that allows for a normal 
administrative delay and through a market or exchange mechanism in which an exchange transaction would create 
enforceable rights and obligations. If a currency is not exchangeable into another currency, an entity is required to 
estimate the spot exchange rate at the measurement date. An entity’s objective in estimating the spot exchange rate 
is to reflect the rate at which an orderly exchange transaction would take place at the measurement date between 
mark
et participants under prevailing economic conditions. The amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU. 
Management does not expect that the adoption of these amendments will have a significant impact on the Group’s 
financial statements.
4.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Group’s management discusses with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the Group’s 
ma
terial accounting policies, as well as their application.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors which are 
c
onsidered reasonable under the circumstances. These are used to make judgements about the carrying values of assets 
and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and associated assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
r
ecognised in the period when the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the 
r
evision and future periods if the revision affects both.
Judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Consolidated Financial Statements 
and es
timates that can cause a significant adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year are detailed below.
Valuation of investment property
Investment property is stated at its fair value based on valuation reports prepared by international appraisers as at 
30 June and 31 December each year. Valuations are based on discounted cash flow projections based on reliable 
es
timates of future cash flows, using discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the uncertainty in the 
amount and timing of the cash flows. These are supported by the terms of any existing lease and other contracts and by 
e
xternal evidence such as current market rents for similar properties in the same location and condition.
In preparing the valuation reports on the Group’s investment property, the external appraisers excluded distressed sales 
when c
onsidering comparable sales prices (used for valuation of plots of land held for development). Management 
reviewed the appraisers’ assumptions relating to the discounted cash flow models used in the valuations and confirmed 
that factors such as the discount rate applied have been appropriately determined considering the market conditions at 
the end of the r
eporting period.
Valuations of the income generating properties are based on cash flow statements, in which the present value of net 
oper
ating income during a ten-year period and the residual value of the property at the end of the period are calculated.
Forecasts of net operating income are based on leases signed at the time of the valuation date, the estimated rental 
v
alues for existing leases when they expire and the estimated achievable rental values of the existing vacancies. The 
value of long-term vacancies is estimated based on the properties’ location and condition. The valuers’ assessments 
of non-recoverable expenses are based on their experience of comparable properties and historical costs provided by 
the Group.
The discount rates used are nominal returns on total capital before tax and vary between 7.90% and 11.95% (2022: 7.30% 
and 11.9
5%). The required rates of return are based on assessments of the market’s required returns for similar properties. 
The discount rate is set individually for each property and is based on the condition and location, the stability of the 
tenants and lease duration.
Further information relating to sensitivity of material accounting estimates used in the valuation of investment property 
is pr
esented in Note 8.
Functional currency
In assessing the functional currency of the Group, including the Company and its subsidiaries, management considers 
f
actors such as the local currencies of the countries where the Group operates, as well as the currency that mainly 
influences rental prices for its properties, the currency that mostly influences labour, material and other costs of 
pr
oviding its services, the currency in which funding is accessed by the Group.
Although the competitive forces and regulations that determine the sales prices of goods and services are present in the 
c
ountries which use different currencies than EUR, the macroeconomic developments in these countries to some extent 
is influenced by the eurozone. In addition, in real estate, leases agreements in the countries where the Group operates, as 
w
ell as the financing of properties are generally denominated in EUR.
264 NEPI R ockcastle N.V.

Page 265:
The Group predominately concludes its lease agreements in Euro (or, if these contracts are not concluded in Euro, 
the
y are indexed to the Euro exchange rate), even if invoiced in local currencies. Agreements for construction and 
development of investment properties are negotiated and concluded in EUR. Administrative and corporate expenses, 
such as advisory fees, audit fees, valuation fees, asset management fees are mostly negotiated and contracted in EUR. 
Salary and other employee related costs, although denominated in local currencies, are benchmarked to EUR.
Financing contracted by the Group, which include bonds, unsecured credit facilities and secured bank loans is 
denomina
ted and settled in EUR. Interest paid on bank loans is linked to Euribor. Intra-group funding for property 
development is also denominated and settled in EUR.
In terms of transactions on the real estate market, acquisitions and sales of properties are negotiated and contracted 
in EUR in all jurisdictions the Gr
oup operate, due to the active international investors in those markets. This is also 
substantiated in external valuation reports, as valuations of properties are prepared in EUR.
In conclusion, management assessed that EUR is the functional currency for the Group, including the Company and 
its subsidiaries.
Current and deferred tax expense
The Group is subject to income taxes on taxable profits of its companies’ operating in all jurisdictions. The calculation 
of the Group’s tax charge and provisions for income taxes necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgment in 
evaluating the nature of its companies’ transactions and their respective tax treatment.
Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, 
based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits, together with future tax planning strategies.
5.  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group has exposure to the following risks due to its use of financial instruments: credit, liquidity, and market, 
including c
urrency and interest rate. This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each, as well as its 
objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management 
fr
amework. The Board of Directors has delegated the responsibility for developing this framework to the Risk Committee. 
This Committee reports to the Board of Directors on its activities, oversees how management monitors compliance 
policies and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the framework regarding the risks faced.
The Group’s policies are established to identify and analyse the risks it may encounter by performing its activities, to set 
appr
opriate limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. These policies and systems are reviewed 
regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and Group activities.
Impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty
The Groups operations remain unaffected by the military conflicts in any significant way. All the markets where NEPI 
Rockcastle operates are outside the conflict areas and continue to function normally. The indirect macroeconomic effects 
that the conflicts had in the CEE region, such as the increase in energy and other commodities costs, did not have a 
significant impact in the current year, as the local economies adapted to the new context. Nevertheless, due to ongoing 
unc
ertainty in geopolitical landscape and volatility in the financial markets, the Group continues to closely monitor 
de
velopment in all market conditions.
As part of appropriate risk management measures, and identifying and managing risk, management has considered 
pos
sible events and conditions for the purpose of identifying whether these events and conditions affect or may affect 
the future performance of the Group.
The following risks were assessed:
Surge in operational costs due to increased energy prices
The increase in energy prices in 2023 had minimal direct effect on NEPI Rockcastle, as its operations are not energy 
int
ensive. Moreover, the majority of energy costs incurred by the Group are passed on to its tenants, which were able 
to absorb the increased energy costs due to the strong growth in sales in substantially all jurisdictions of operation. 
The occupancy cost ratio of Group’s tenants has been consistent over the last periods. As the photovoltaic projects in 
Romania are substantially completed, NEPI Rockcastle will produce solar energy using photovoltaic panels installed on 
the rooftops of the Group’s properties. This will further contribute to mitigation of the risk of increased energy costs, as 
well as contribute to a faster transition of the group to green energy use, with a positive impact on the value of its assets.
Impact on credit risk tenant receivable
NEPI Rockcastle did not experience any significant change in the collection rate of its receivables from tenants in 2023 
as c
ompared to previous periods, there were no important client losses due to bankruptcies or financial difficulties. In 
f
act, the tenant receivables collection pattern and tenant discipline has not changed since the end of the pandemic, 
with majority of receivables paid within the contracted payment period. The increasing tenant sales have proved to 
be a continuous trend since the pandemic, throughout 2022 and 2023 and there are indications that this trend will 
continue in near future. The Group regularly consults retailers to gain insight into their performance and assess their 
financial robustness.
Annual Report 2023 265

Page 266:
Disruptions in the Group’s development program
The current macroeconomic context had an effect on the price fluctuations and changes in availability of construction 
materials, components and services, which are required by the Group for its pipeline related to development and 
extension of its planned projects. NEPI Rockcastle has an in-house development team, which controls the construction 
process, which is in its turn monitored by the Investment Committee. As a general rule, development projects are 
entered into in a phased manner, allowing management the possibility to put certain construction projects on hold if 
circumstances, such as availability or price of resources, require it. Also, the development team usually enters into fixed 
price contracts with suppliers when ordering components for committed projects going into construction, thus allowing 
t
o mitigate potential spikes in material prices.
Refinancing risk and impact on loan covenants
Global financial markets continued to experience disruptions, including increased volatility and diminished liquidity and 
credit availability. NEPI Rockcastle is in constant contact with its current and prospective financing partners. As disclosed 
in Not
e 18 Borrowings, in December 2023 the Group successfully concluded several funding extensions and agreements, 
including a €387 million green unsecured sustainability-linked loan facility, syndicated by the International Finance 
Corporation (IFC). These agreements ensure that the Group not only has access to ample liquidity but also will have 
no material debt maturities until the end of 2025. The Group is also closely monitoring its loan covenants, which currently 
show ample headroom for all existing loan arrangements, while also ensuring that future compliance with covenants will 
be achieved based on current and future financing arrangements and forecast results.
Broader economic impact in the jurisdictions where the Group operates
The uncertain macroeconomic outlook, with high inflation can ultimately affect the labour market and purchasing power 
of c
onsumers, which can in turn impact Group operations and valuation of its properties. The diversified nature of 
Gr
oup’s portfolio, with 60 assets across 9 CEE countries and thousands of tenants from across the retail industry 
spectrum, mitigates risks associated with adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions (inflation, increased costs). 
R
ents paid by the top ten tenants represented 25.2% of the Group’ revenues in the year ended 31 December 2023. 
Furthermor
e, the annual rent indexation mechanism (HICP EU27), which is used by the Group in all of its leases with its 
tenants, provides the Group with an economic hedge against inflation. The Group’s main tenants are leading companies 
in their sect
ors and all tenants are subject to a financial review before signing leases with the Group.
Valuers included in their valuations assumptions factors resulting from the indirect impact of the current macroeconomic 
en
vironment, through:
• increased valuation yields (weighted average of 15 bps);
• adjusting future cash flows with risk premia, to account for additional unrecoverable expenses and potential 
c
ollection difficulties (on average 0.5%);
• indexing the future cash flows with projected inflation rates for the next period (in the range of 2.1% - 2.2%).
More details on valuation assumptions and inputs are provided in Notes 8 and 9.
5.1 Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from tenants and cash and cash equivalents.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk 
a
t the reporting date is set out below:
Credit exposure on financial instruments Note 31 Dec 2023 31 Dec 2022
in € thousand
Tenant receivables 12 71,721 59,691
Cash and cash equivalents 13 338,519 250,631
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss1 19 21,568 36,064
Loans to participants in the Share Purchase Scheme2 10, 17 3,451 4,205
Total 435,259 350,591
1 Includes both long-term and short-term financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
2 Presented in line Other long-term assets in the Statement of financial position
Out of the above maximum credit exposure, the balance of Loans to participants in the Share Purchase Scheme is not 
c
onsidered to present credit risk as these are guaranteed with the Company’s shares held as security (see details in 
Note 17).
When monitoring customer credit risk, customers are grouped according to their credit characteristics, including whether 
the
y are an individual or legal entity, the industry they work in, business size and previous financial difficulties.
The exposure to credit risk is mainly influenced by the tenant’s individual characteristics. The Group’s widespread 
c
ustomer base reduces credit risk. The majority of rental income 68%, (31 December 2022: 67%) is derived from type A 
t
enants (large international and national tenants; large listed tenants; government and major franchisees and companies 
266 NEPI R ockcastle N.V.

Page 267:
with assets and/or turnovers exceeding €200 million), and there is no concentration of credit risk with respect to trade 
debt
ors: top 10 tenants account for 25.2% of the rental income as at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 24.8%).
Management has established a credit policy where new customers are analysed individually for creditworthiness before 
s
tandard payment terms and conditions are offered. When available, the analysis includes external ratings.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment based on a simplified expected credit loss model in respect of 
T
rade and other receivables. For credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since 
initial r
ecognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 
12-months (a 12-month ECL). For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk 
sinc
e initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, 
irrespective of the timing of the default (a lifetime ECL).
The carrying value of financial assets approximates their fair value. The Group’s exposure to credit risk associated 
cash and cash equivalents is limited through using financial institutions of good standing for investment and cash 
handling purposes.
An overview of the tenant receivables net of impairment provision is set out below:
in € thousand Note 31 Dec 2023 31 Dec 2022
Tenant receivables – gross 82,422 69,033

TENANT RECEIVABLES - NET OF IMPAIRMENT PROVISION 12 71,721 59,691
Reconciliation of impairment provisions is set out below:
Movement of provisions for doubtful debtors 31 Dec 2023 31 Dec 2022

Carrying value at beginning of the year (9,342) (7,282)
Additional provision from properties acquired during the year - (2,489)
Additional expected credit losses (5,485) (2,841)
Write-off of receivables 1,900 986
Recovery of previously expected credit losses 2,366 2,182
Transfers to assets held for sale 100 -
Foreign exchange gain (240) 102
Carrying value (10,701) (9,342)
The expected loss rates are based on the historical payment profiles of tenants and the corresponding historical credit 
los
ses, adjusting for forward looking macroeconomic data. For example, if forecast economic conditions are expected 
to deteriorate over the next year which can lead to an increased number of defaults in a customer segment, the 
historical default rates are adjusted upwards. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated 
and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed. On that basis, the provision for doubtful debtors as at 
31 December
 2023 was determined as follows for trade receivables:

For purposes of liquidity management, the Group has various deposit accounts and negotiated current account 
agr
eements with several banks. The arrangements in place result in an optimized mix between flexibility and reduced 
int
erest charges or best interest offered. The banks’ credit ratings, as well as exposure per each bank are constantly 
monitored. At 31 December 2023, 97% of the Group's cash was held with investment-grade rated banks (31 December 
2022: 95%), as detailed below:

5.2 Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations when due. The Group’s approach 
t
o managing this risk ensures, as far as possible, it will always have enough liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under 
normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to its reputation. To ensure this 
occurs, the Group prepares budgets, cash 
flow analyses and forecasts, which enable the Directors to assess the level of 
financing required for future periods. Budgets and projections are used to assess any future potential investments and 
ar
e compared to existing funds held on deposit to evaluate the nature, and extent of any future funding requirements.
Further reference to bank loan maturity analysis is made in Note 18.

5.3 Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates or equity prices will 
affect the Group’s fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is 
to manage market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising returns. The carrying value of financial 
assets and liabilities approximates their fair value, except for the carrying value of bonds.
5.3.1 Currency risk
Group’s current assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk on purchases and receivables denominated in 
R
omanian leu (RON), Polish zloty (PLN), Bulgarian Lev (BGN), Hungarian forint (HUF), Serbian dinar (RSD), Czech crown 
(CZK) and South African rand (ZAR). Cash inflows received in other currencies than Euro are converted to Euro using the 
spot r
ate available on the collection date. The amount converted to Euro is the net amount of cash inflow in a foreign 
c
urrency and the estimated cash outflow in the same currency. The Group applies this policy to control its currency 
e
xposures in respect of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than EUR. Sensitivities of profit or 
los
s to reasonably possible changes in exchange rates applied at the financial position date relative to the local currency 
of the r
espective Group entities, with all other variables such as interest rates held constant, are immaterial.
5.3.2 Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash 
flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in 
mark
et interest rates. The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on loans, borrowings and cash balances held. Group 
policy is to substantially hedge this risk through the use of derivative financial instruments. As at 31 December 2023 and 
31 December 2022, the Group held interest rate instruments in the form of interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, as 
further disclosed in Note 19.

Sensitivity analysis for interest bearing financial instruments
A change of 100 basis points (bps) in interest rates would have increased/(decreased) equity and profit for the year 
as sho
wn below. Calculations are based on the cash and loans and borrowings balances outstanding at the respective 
balance sheet dates as of 31 December 2023 and respectively 31 December 2022. Cash and loans and borrowings 
balanc
es are subject to change over the year. This analysis assumes that all other variables, particularly foreign currency 
rates, remain constant. All sensitivity analysis calculations presented below are before tax.
The benchmark rate for the bank loans with an outstanding amount of €533,721 thousand as at 31 December 2023 (2022: 
€557,901 thousand) is Euribor 3 months; if this rate is less than zero, Euribor shall be deemed to be zero. There are no 
plans to discontinue Euribor.
Loans and borrowings with fixed or swapped interest rates are not affected by market changes in interest rates.

5.4 Fair value of financial instruments
To estimate the fair value of individual classes of financial instruments, the following methods and assumptions are used:
Cash and cash equivalents
The book value of cash approximates their fair value, as these financial instruments have a short maturity.
Receivables and payables
The book value of short-term receivables and payables approximates their fair value, as these financial instruments have 
a short ma
turity.
Short-term loans
The book value approximates their fair value, as these instruments have a floating interest rate and a short maturity.
Long-term loans
The fair value of long-term loans as at 31 December 2023 is €583,146 thousand (2022 – €614,903 thousand). The 
v
aluation model of fair value of bank loans considers the present value of expected payments, discounted using risk 
adjusted discount rate. The Group has determined that all of its Interest-bearing loans and borrowings from financial 
institutions are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. To determine the fair value of such instruments, 
management used a v
aluation technique in which all significant inputs were based on observable market data.
Bonds
The fair value of bonds outstanding as at 31 December 2023 is presented in Note 18.
Derivatives
The fair value of derivatives is based on fair value quotes from counterparty banks and are disclosed in Note 19.
6.  INTERNAL CONTROLS TO MANAGE RISKS
The Board of Directors is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. This 
s
ystem is designed to mitigate rather than eliminate the risk of failure to meet business objectives, and can only provide 
reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The key features of the Group’s system of internal control include:
•Strategic and business planning: the Group prepares, and agrees, a business plan each year, to which the performance 
of the busines
s is regularly monitored;
270 NEPI R ockcastle N.V.

Page 271:
• Investment appraisal: capital projects, major contracts and business and property acquisitions are reviewed in detail 
and appr
oved by the Investment Committee, and/or the Board of Directors where appropriate, in accordance with 
delegated authority limits;
• Financial monitoring: profitability, cash flow and capital expenditure are closely monitored, and key financial 
information is reported to the Board of Directors regularly, including explanations of variances between actual and 
budget
ed performance; and
• Systems of control procedures and delegated authority: clearly defined guidelines and approval limits exist for capital 
and oper
ating expenditure and other key business transactions and decisions.
7.  CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure it complies with its quantitative banking covenants 
and maintains a s
trong credit rating. During the year, no changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes.
Capital is primarily monitored using the gearing ratio (Loan-to-value or “LTV”), which was 32.2% (31 December 2022: 
3
5.7%). The Group’s strategic LTV threshold is 35%. The ratio is computed as interest bearing debt less lease liabilities 
less cash, divided by investment property (including investment property held for sale) and excludes the right-of-use 
assets. Loan-to-value is a non IFRS measure.
The Group’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base of equity so as to maintain investor, creditor and market 
confidence and to sustain future business development. In particular, the Group monitors the Debt/ Debt + Equity 
ratio, a non IFRS measure, calculated as interest bearing debt less lease liabilities less cash, divided by interest bearing 
debt less lease liabilities less cash and shareholders’ equity. The Debt/ Debt + Equity ratio targeted by the Group is a 
maximum 40%. As at 31 December 2023, the Debt/ Debt + Equity ratio was 34.1% (31 December 2022: 37.6%). The Board 
of Dir
ectors also monitors the level of distributions to shareholders. Neither the Company, nor its subsidiaries, are subject 
to externally imposed capital requirements, except that the Group’s subsidiaries are subject to compliance with bonds 
and bank borrowings’ covenants, as presented in Note 18.
The Group ensures it retains comfortable levels of access to liquidity to finance the Group’s ongoing operations and 
further investment opportunities.

As at 31 December 2023, the balance of investment property included also right-of-use assets of €56,520 thousand 
(2022: €37,200 thousand) representing long-term land concessions for the Group Polish properties contracted from 
local government.
The significant additions to investment property transferred from investment property under development are in most 
part the result of development at Promenada Craiova mall, completed during the year and opened in October 2023, and 
the completion of investments in photovoltaic panels on Romanian properties.
Investment property is carried at fair value and is independently assessed on a semi-annual basis, as at 30 June and 
31 December.
For the year ended 31 December 2023 - the Group commissioned independent appraisal reports on its investment 
pr
operty from Cushman&Wakefield and Affiliate Partners and Colliers International (for the year ended 31 December 
2022: Cushman&Wakefield and Affiliate Partners, Colliers International and Jones Lang LaSalle), all of whom are 
members of the R
oyal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). Valuations are prepared in accordance with the RICS 
Valuation – Global Standards 2021 (the “Red Book") and ANEVAR Valuation Standards - 2022 Edition which incorporate 
the International Valuation Standards (“IVS”).
All investment property in use is valued by the Income Method. For the years ended 31 December 2023 and 31 December 
2022 respectively, the applied method used for all investment property in use was discounted cash flow (“DCF”).
Annual Report 2023 2
 71

Page 272:
DCF uses explicit assumptions regarding the benefits and liabilities of ownership over the asset’s life, including an exit, or 
terminal, value. As an accepted method within the Income Method to valuation, the DCF method involves the projection 
of a series of cash flows onto a real property interest. To these projected cash flow series, an appropriate, market-derived 
disc
ount rate is applied to establish the present value of cash inflows associated with the real property.
The duration of cash flow, and the specific timing of inflows and outflows, are determined by events such as rent 
r
eviews, lease renewal and related lease-up periods, re-letting, redevelopment or refurbishment. The appropriate duration 
is typically driven by market behaviour. In the case of investment property, periodic cash flow is typically estimated as 
gross income less vacancy, non-recoverable expenses, collection losses, lease incentives, maintenance costs, agent and 
commission fees, and other operating and management expenses. The series of periodic net cash inflows, combined 
with the es
timated terminal value anticipated at the end of the projection period, is then discounted. For all investment 
property in use, the current use equates to the highest and best use.
The Group provides all information necessary for the valuations, including detailed tenancy schedules, comprising 
inf
ormation on occupied and vacant units, unit areas and numbers, lease commencement and expiry dates, break options 
and indexation clauses. All properties have been inspected by representatives of external valuers for the purpose of 
31 December 2023 valuations.
The Group’s valuers note in their valuation reports that wherever appropriate, sustainability and environmental matters 
ar
e an integral part of the valuation approach. Sustainability is taken to mean the consideration of such matters as 
environment and climate change, health and wellbeing and corporate responsibility that can or do impact the valuation 
of an asset. In a valuation context, sustainability encompasses a wide range of physical, social, environmental, and 
economic factors that can affect value. The range of issues includes key environmental risks, such as energy efficiency 
and climate, as well as matters of design, 
configuration, accessibility, legislation, management, and fiscal considerations.
As at 31 December 2023, the investment property in use had an EPRA Vacancy Rate of 2.2% (31 December 2022: 2.7%). 
EPRA V
acancy Rate is a non-IFRS measure which is defined in section Other information, Glossary.
As compared to the valuations on 31 December 2022, the estimated rental values generally increased, supported by the 
excellent performance of the assets, and valuation yields slightly increased as well (by 15 basis points on average).
As at 31 December 2023, the Group’s portfolio included retail, office and industrial properties.
The Group currently discloses fair values according to a ‘fair value hierarchy’ (as per IFRS 13) which categorises the 
inputs used in v
aluation techniques into three levels. The hierarchy gives the highest priority (Level 1) to quoted prices 
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority (Level 3) to unobservable inputs. The fair value 
hierarchy is explained below:
• Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• Level 2: use of a model with inputs (other than quoted prices included within Level 1) that are directly, or indirectly, 
observ
able market data, and
• Level 3: use of a model with inputs not based on observable market data.
The Group’s investment property is categorised as Level 3. For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial 
statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy 
b
y re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a 
whole) at the end of each reporting period. There were no transfers between hierarchy levels during the year.
The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement categorized within Level 3 of the fair value 
hierarchy of the Group’s property portfolio, together with the impact of significant movements in these inputs on the fair 
v
alue measurement, are detailed below:

Carrying value 197,743 264,344
Land included in Investment property under development is carried at fair value and is independently assessed on 
a semi-annual basis. F
or the year ended 31 December 2023 the Group commissioned independent year-end reports 
to Cushman&Wakefield and Affiliate Partners and Colliers International (for the year ended 31 December 2022: 
Cushman&Wakefield and Affiliate Partners, Colliers International and Jones Lang LaSalle), based on which the fair value 
of land was adjusted. Land included in Investment property under development is classified Level 3 on the fair value 
hierarchy as defined in IFRS 13.
The valuation technique is sales comparison or residual approach, in accordance with RICS Valuation Standards and 
ANEV
AR Valuation Standards (for Romanian properties). Land under sales comparison method was valued by the 
external appraisers using the recent transactions of similar land for development in the proximity of the subject property.
The estimated fair value of Investment property under development would increase/(decrease) if the market comparable 
pric
e per square meter is higher/(lower) as there is a direct relationship between the fair value and the market 
comparable price per square meter.
The residual approach determines the residual land value by subtracting purchase and development cost from the 
e
xpected gross development value of the project at completion. The construction works in the investment property 
under development are held at cost, and their carrying value is a reasonable approximation of their fair value. The 
methods have been consistently applied for the comparative period.
Borrowing costs capitalised in 2023 amount to €5,085 thousand (2022: €3,513 thousand) and were calculated using an 
a
verage annual interest rate of 2.5% (2022: 2.3%).

There were no movements of goodwill in 2023 and 2022.
According to the Group’s accounting policies based on IFRS, goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment or 
whene
ver there is an indication that it may be impaired. The lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is 
allocated and monitored for internal management purposes is the CGU, represented by each individual property. CGUs 
to which the goodwill has been allocated were tested for impairment by comparing their net asset value with the 
recoverable value, which is the higher of value in use and fair value less cost to sell.
Goodwill from recognition of deferred taxes at the date of the business combination
All the goodwill summarised in the table above, with the exception of NEPI Investment Management and Energit, resulted 
fr
om business combinations, as the difference between the deferred tax liability recognised in the balance sheet of the 
busines
s acquired and the expected tax to be paid in case of a future disposal.
As a consequence, impairment tests performed on this type of goodwill at each reporting date consist in comparing its 
carrying amount with the amounts e
xpected to arise from deferred taxes payable, should a disposal occur, at the level of 
each CGU.
Annual Report 2023 2 75

Page 276:
As a result of this test in 2023, no impairment arose in respect to the goodwill from recognition of deferred taxes at the 
da
te of the business combination (31 December 2022: nil).
Goodwill from management and energy trading companies
Goodwill arising at the level of management company, NEPI Investment Management, is monitored at the level of 
this subsidiary
, which employs part of the Group’s key management and charges management fees to property 
operating companies.
The recoverable amount of NEPI Investment Management and Energit is represented by their value in use, determined 
based on the DCF deriv
ed from the five-year financial budgets for these two entities approved by management. Cash 
flows beyond the five-year period were extrapolated using the estimated cash flow of year 5. The discount rate used was 
based on the w
eighted average cost of capital in the specific geography of the two entities.
As a result of this test, no impairment arose in connection with the above two entities.

15.  INVENTORY PROPERTY
The Group has a residential property development that it intends to sell on completion. The residential project is held as 
in
ventory property and is measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value (“NRV”).
The commencement of development with a plan or a prior agreement to sell represents a change in use and accordingly 
the pr
oject is transferred from investment property to inventory property.
NRV is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, based on market prices at the reporting date, less 
es
timated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
The Group has a residential property development that was completed in 2023 and the sale of its units (apartments)

In February 2023, the Board has declared a final distribution of 27.85 euro cents per share for the six months ended 
31 December 2022, corresponding to a 95% dividend pay-out ratio, to be received as capital repayment (to be settled 
from Share capital). Shareholders could have also elected the settlement of the same dividend amount as ordinary cash 
distribution out of distributable profits (to be settled from Accumulated profit).
As an alternative, the shareholders were given the option to elect to receive a dividend of 29.32 euro cents, 
c
orresponding to a 100% pay-out ratio, as a scrip issue (issue of new shares).

17.  SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Group has implemented incentive plans to reward performance and align the interests of executive directors and key 
individuals with those of the shar
eholders.
The aim of the Group’s incentive plan (“Incentive Plan”) is to motivate directors and employees to meet the Group’s 
short-t
erm and long-term objectives by giving such participants an opportunity to receive performance-based Awards 
(in cash or shares), on short-term (immediate settlement in cash or shares) or long-term (shares with a vesting 
component). The Board determines which executive directors are eligible to participate in the Incentive Plan, and 
the allocation of incentives, based on key performance indicators. The executive directors determine which key 
employees are eligible to participate in the Incentive Plan, and the allocation of incentives is discretionary, based on 
key performance indicators and other considerations regarding the employees’ performance.
To date, NEPI Rockcastle has initiated two types of incentive programs that 
offered share-based payments in exchange 
f
or services provided to it by its directors and employees (equity-settled transactions), which are detailed below.
a. Purchase Offers (“SPS”)
Under this program, loans were granted to participants in the share purchase schemes (the “Share Purchase Scheme” or 
“SPS”) t
o buy shares, the repayment of which could be made in part out of the distribution payable in relation to the 
shares (the “NRP SPS”). Of the shares initially subscribed for, 20% vested annually. The Group offered each participant 
the immedia
te right to subscribe for the permitted number of shares at their market value, less a maximum discount of 
5%, together with a loan to fund the purchase. Each loan carried interest at the weighted average rate that the Group 
can borrow money. Loans are payable in full, together with interest, ten years after its subscription date, but could be 
repaid earlier. The Company has security interests that ensure the repayment of the principal and interest on the loan 
given to participants. The NRP SPS is a full recourse scheme (i.e., recourse in relation to loans granted is not limited 
to shares issued). Pending repayment of the loan, the distributions on such shares are used to repay loan interest. Any 
excess distribution after interest payment is used to repay the loan.
No shares were issued during 2023 and 2022 under the NRP SPS.

Page 280:
b. Debt free Long-Term Share Incentive Plan with a vesting component (“LTSIP”)
Under this incentive plan, shares are awarded by the Group to executive directors and other key employees for no cash 
c
onsideration. For key employees, shares are awarded to participants on condition of employment in the Group for the 
next three years (vesting period), with shares being vested proportionally over each year of the corresponding vesting 
periods (tranche vesting). For executive directors, shares are awarded subject to a full vesting of them at the end of 
three years (cliff vesting) plus a further two-year lock-up period, during which the vested shares cannot be disposed of 
b
y the directors. Shares awarded under LTSIP cannot be disposed of or otherwise encumbered up to their respective 
vesting dates.

18.  BORROWINGS (BONDS AND BANK LOANS)
The Group is currently assigned a long-term corporate credit rating of BBB (stable outlook) from Standard & Poor’s 
Ra
ting Services and BBB+ (stable outlook) from Fitch Ratings.
In March 2023 the Group concluded a €200 million secured green loan which matures in June 2028. The loan proceeds 
w
ere used to repay the revolving credit facilities utilised for the acquisition of Forum Gdansk Shopping Center and 
Copernicus Shopping Centre.
In December 2023, the Group extended the contractual maturities to two of its secured term loans – a €40 million loan 
c
ontracted by its subsidiary in Czech Republic extended until December 2030 and a €76 million loan contracted by its 
subsidiary in Poland extended until March 2029.
In 2023, NEPI Rockcastle extended the contractual maturities related to its unsecured committed revolving credit 
f
acilities, as follows:
• the revolving credit facility from BRD-Groupe Société Générale and Garanti Bank was extended for one year, until July 
20
26, with the maximum principal available maintained at €170 million;
• the revolving credit facility from ING Bank was extended for one year, until July 2026, with the maximum principal 
a
vailable maintained at €100 million; and
• the revolving credit facility from a three-bank syndicate lead by Deutsche Bank AG as arranger, was extended for 
thr
ee years, until January 2027, with the maximum principal available decreased to €150 million.
The above mentioned committed revolving credit facilities together with the revolving credit facility of a maximum limit 
of €
150 million with Raiffeisen Bank International amount to a total of €570 million available unsecured committed 
r
evolving credit facilities, undrawn as at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: €620 million, of which €420 million 
w
ere undrawn).
In February 2024, the Group extended the maturity of the revolving credit facility with Raiffeisen Bank International 
until January 20
27 and increased the maximum limit to €196 million, having Erste Group Bank joining the facility. 
Consequently, as at the date of the publication of these financial statements, the revolving credit facilities’ capacity 
amounts t
o €616 million.
In December 2023, NEPI Rockcastle entered into a €387 million green financing agreement with IFC, a member of the 
W
orld Bank Group and the largest global development institution focused on the private sector in emerging markets. The 
senior unsecured facility is structured as a green loan with sustainability-linked features, aimed at reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions and increasing energy efficiency in the Group’s property portfolio. The facility matures in January 2029

Page 281:
and was disbursed in the mid-February 2024. The facility has been put in place to cater for the repayment of the 
upc
oming bond maturing in November 2024.
The average interest rate of the Group’s debt, including hedging result, was approximately 2.5% during 2023 
(31 December 2022: 2.3%). As at 31 December 2023, fixed-coupon bonds represented 78% of NEPI Rockcastle’s 
outstanding debt; out of the remaining long-term debt exposed to Euribor, 79% was hedged with interest rate caps 
and 21% with interest rate swaps.
The fair value of all financial instruments is substantially in line with their carrying amounts as reflected on the Statement 
of financial position, except for the bonds. For reference, as at 31 December 2023, the €499 million bonds issued in 2017 
w
ere trading on the market at 96.78% (31 December 2022: 93.55%), the €500 million bonds issued in 2019 were trading 
on the mark
et at 91.22% (31 December 2022: 84.13%), the €500 million bonds issued in July 2020 were trading on the 
market at 94.43% (31 December 2022: 86.52%) and the €500 million bonds issued in January 2022 were trading on the

Further details for the Group’s loans and bonds are presented below:
Secured term loans
The Group has secured term loans contracted by some of its subsidiaries in Poland, Slovakia, Czech Republic, and 
R
omania. In March 2023, two Romanian subsidiaries concluded a €200 million secured loan which matures in June 2028.
Securities
• General security over the properties (fair values as at 31 December 2023), current assets, cash inflows from operating 
activities, accounts and receivables; and
• General security over the shares in the property-owning entities.
Covenants
•Debt service cover ratio of a minimum between 120% and 125%; and
• Loan to value ratio of a maximum between 60% and 70%.
282 NEPI R
 ockcastle N.V.

Page 283:
Unsecured green term loan
The Group has a green unsecured financing agreement which matures in June 2028 in amount of €73.5 million.
Covenants
• Solvency Ratio of maximum 0.60;
• Consolidated Coverage Ratio of minimum 2:1; and
• Unsecured Ratio of minimum 150%.
Unsecured committed revolving facilities
At 31 December 2023, there were €570 million revolving facilities available for drawdown.
Covenants
• Solvency Ratio of maximum 0.60;
• Consolidated Coverage Ratio of minimum 2:1; and
• Unsecured Ratio of minimum 150%.
All available revolving facilities are linked either to the ESG performance of the Group through the sustainability 
r
ating provided by Sustainalytics or have sustainability-linked KPIs in line with the Group’s Sustainability-Linked 
Financing Framework.
Management considers that the above ESG related variability feature does not meet the definition of a derivative, as 
defined in Appendix A of IFRS 9, on the basis that the external rating is a non–financial variable specific to the Group.
Unsecured fixed coupon bonds
The Group successfully issued fixed coupon bonds as follows:
• November 2017: €500 million of unsecured, 7-year Eurobonds. The bonds mature on 23 November 2024 and carry a 
1.
75% fixed coupon, with an issue price of 99.051%;
• October 2019: €500 million of unsecured, 7-year Eurobonds. The bonds mature on 9 October 2026 and carry a 
1.8
75% fixed coupon, with an issue price of 98.927%;
• July 2020: €500 million of unsecured, 7-year Eurobonds. The bonds mature on 14 July 2027 and carry a 3.375% fixed 
coupon, with an issue price of 98.172%; and
• January 2022: €500 million of unsecured, 8-year Eurobonds. The bonds mature on 21 January 2030 and carry a 
2.
00% fixed coupon, with an issue price of 98.713%.
All the bonds include early redemption options. At each date of bond issue initial recognition management has 
perf
ormed an assessment whether those options are closely related to the host contract, considering the IFRS 9 clauses, 
which states that early repayment options are closely related to the host debt, if either:
• the option’s exercise price is approximately equal on each exercise date to the host debt instrument’s amortised 
c
ost; or
• the exercise price of a prepayment option reimburses the lender for an amount up to the approximate present value 
of los
t interest for the remaining term of the host contract.
Based on management assessment in case of the exercise of any of the early redemption options either first or second 
crit
eria will be met, therefore those were considered as closely related to the bond and thus not separately valued 
and disclosed.
Covenants
• Solvency Ratio of maximum 0.60;
• Consolidated Coverage Ratio of minimum 2:1; and
• Unsecured Ratio of minimum 150%.
NEPI Rockcastle has complied with all financial covenants of its borrowing facilities during 2023 and 2022. The ratios 
calculated for all unsecured loans and bonds showed ample headroom compared to the covenants:
• Solvency Ratio: 0.38 (31 December 2022: 0.40);
• Consolidated Coverage Ratio: 6.06 (31 December 2022: 6.2); and
• Unsecured Ratio: 269% (31 December 2022: 251%).

19.  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS
The Group uses mainly derivative instruments to hedge variable interest rate (Euribor) exposure. Their fair value is 
summarised belo
w:
in € thousand 31 Dec 2023 31 Dec 2022
Derivative financial assets – long term 12,241 25,585
Derivative financial assets – short term 9,327 10,479
The above financial assets and liabilities consist of interest rate caps and fixed interest rate swaps which are not 
designa
ted as cash flow hedges. The fair value was categorised in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The derivative financial assets and liabilities classification to non-current or current sections of the Statement of financial 
position is driven by the contractual maturities of the instruments.
At 31 December 2023, €433 million of debt exposed to Euribor was hedged with interest rate caps and €113 million with 
int
erest rate swaps.

22.  LOANS FROM THIRD PARTY
As part of the deal for the acquisition of Forum Gdansk Sp. z o.o. (made in 2022), the Group obtained vendor financing in 
the f
orm of a three-year unsecured loan from the seller, for part of the purchase price amounting to €50,000 thousand, 
bearing an interest rate of 6.5%. One third of the loan principal is repayable at each anniversary of the loan until maturity, 
however the loan can be repaid by the Group at any time at its own discretion. The fair value of the loan is substantially in 
line with its carrying amount.
This section sets out the movements in loans from third parties for the periods presented.

23.  LEASE LIABILITIES
The Group recognises the right-of-use assets from leases of land plots on which its Polish properties are located, 
c
ommissioned from the local authorities. The correspondent lease liabilities are recognised by discounting the 
contractual lease payments using the interest rate implicit in the lease, representing the rate that the lessee would have 
to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic 
environment with similar terms, security and conditions. The contractual lease agreements are signed for the period of 
99 years with extension option by the lessee. The agreements include fixed payment terms subject to adjustment due to 
r
evaluation of land, such revaluation can be done by the lessor not more often than every three years.

24.  CORPORATE TAX CHARGE AND DEFERRED TAX
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except to 
the e
xtent they relate to business combination or items recognised directly to equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities 
are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the assets are realised or the liabilities are 
settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. Deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which temporary 
differences can be utilised.

1 Other deductible and taxable temporary differences include mainly prepayments and accruals, deferred income and allowances for doubtful debts.
The deferred tax balance as at 31 December 2023 is the net effect of deferred tax assets resulted mainly from fiscal 
losses and deferred tax liabilities resulted from differences between the fiscal base and the accounting base of assets 
and liabilities, mainly in
vestment property. Deferred tax liabilities are not expected to be settled within the following five 
years from the reporting date.
Deferred tax liabilities, which are a non-cash item, result directly from the fair value revaluation of the investment 
pr
operty and other local tax adjustments (e.g., local tax depreciation charges, non-capitalisation of certain items, 
foreign exchange impact given that tax value is recorded in local currency, etc.) which diminishes the tax value of the 
investment property.

The Group accounts for deferred taxes assuming the theoretical future disposals of properties in the form of asset deals, 
triggering the full c
orporate income tax rate in each jurisdiction in which the Group owns property. In practice, if the 
Group would be in the position to dispose of certain assets, these disposals will most probably be conducted via share 
deals, as assets are held in separate SPVs, significantly reducing the effective tax rate on potential capital gains.
Group subsidiaries are subject to corporate tax on an annual basis. The Group carries forward aggregate fiscal losses of 
€314,2
43 thousand (31 December 2022: €249,282 thousand), which are mainly available for up to seven years to offset 
against any future taxable profits of the companies in which the losses arose. The notable exception is the Netherlands 
wher
e, starting 1 January 2022 tax losses available as at 31 December 2021 may be used for an indefinite amount of time 
t
o offset against 50% of the future taxable profits of the Dutch companies. Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused

tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilised. 
Significant management judgement is required to determine recognisable deferred tax assets, based on the likely timing 
and the level of future taxable profits and future tax planning strategies. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised 
f
or fiscal losses of €78,780 thousand (31 December 2022: €40,754 thousand) as these could have been used only to 
offset the taxable profits of certain companies in the Group, and there is uncertainty whether these companies will either

The Group rents its investment property under operating leases of various expiry terms. The standard terms of the leases 
c
omprise information relating to leased space, rent, rights and obligations of the landlord and tenant, including notice 
periods, renewal options and service charge arrangements. For most of the leases, the rent is indexed annually, over the 
term of the leases. Most retail leases have turnover rent clauses, which specify that if the agreed percentage of turnover 
from the retail unit under lease exceeds the base rent, the tenant will pay the difference to the Group.
A proportion of 5.1% (€26,205 thousand) of the Gross rental income is represented by the turnover rent (paid on top of 
fixed rent) as at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 4.4% (€ 18,758 thousand)).
Lease incentives represent the non-recurring amount granted (in cash or as fit-out works) by the Group, to a new or 
an e
xisting tenant, in connection with a new or renewed lease. Lease incentives are straight-lined over the lease term. 
The lease term corresponds to the contractual duration for the majority of the leases, except for the anchor tenants, for 
which the lease duration is assessed by the Group based on past experience and taking into account factors such as: GLA 
of the property where the anchor tenant is located, catchment area, dominance/competition in the catchment area or 
purchasing power.

Gain from reversal of litigation claim - 21,304
In October 2017, one of the Group's subsidiaries entered into an agreement in relation to the conditional acquisition of an 
oper
ating shopping centre and a related development, Serenada and Krokus Shopping Centres in Poland. On 1 January 
2019, upon the lapse of the respective transaction's long stop date, the subsidiary notified the counterparty that it had 
e
xercised its right to terminate the transaction as the long stop date had passed and certain conditions precedent had 
not been met. The counterparty consequently initiated arbitration proceedings against the Group, claiming a contractual 
penalty in the amount of €30 million.
On 31 January 2022, the Group was informed by the Arbitral Tribunal that the arbitrators ordered that the Group is liable 
to pay the contractual penalty of €30 million plus accumulated interest and arbitration expenses. A litigation provision 
expense was previously recognised as a result in the 2021 financial statements for the amount of €37,304 thousand.
Following negotiations between the Company and the counterparty to the initial transaction, the parties agreed on 
23 November 2022 on an amicable settlement. Pursuant to the settlement, the Group paid to the counterparty an 
amount of €
16 million and the parties have reciprocally waived, definitely and irrevocably, all and any present and 
pot
ential rights and claims arising out of or in connection with the initial purchase transaction and Arbitral Tribunal 
award. As a result, a gain from the reversal of the difference between the initially provided amount and the settled 
amount of €21,304 thousand w
as recognised in the 2022 financial statements.

36.  SEGMENT REPORTING
The operating segments for management purposes are the individual properties. For reporting purposes, the Group 
aggr
egates the retail properties (shopping malls and street retail centres) on geographic regions of operation. There are 
a total of nine reportable segments, which include Romania, Poland, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, Serbia, Czech 
Republic, and Lithuania.
Retail properties are considered to have a different economic and risk profiles compared to other types of properties in 
the gr
oup portfolio, therefore are aggregated and reported separately on geographies.
The office, industrial and residential businesses are immaterial for the Group from both operational and financial 
statements disclosure points of view the weight of these categories are around 1% of the total Group portfolio. These 
pr
operties, together with the corporate entities (group holding companies), are separately disclosed in the “Unallocated” 
section below.                                                                                       
The CODM monitor the results of each reportable segment independently for the purposes of allocating resources to 
the segment and as
sessing its performance, as this is the key IFRS 8 driver of segmentation. The measure of reporting 
segment performance is Profit before net finance costs and other items, as disclosed in the following tables. The Group’s 
financing policy (including its impact on financial income and expenses), corporate activities and income tax matters are 
handled a
t Group level, and the resulting impacts are not allocated to the operating segments.
For the balance sheet, the relevant measure of segment analysis is considered the investment properties, as the CODM 
ar
e monitoring closely the asset performance at each reporting date.
Segment investments over a period is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire and develop investment 
pr
operties, as well as capital expenditure spent on investment properties.
In the 2022 financial statements, segment information was presented under five reportable segments (retail, office, 
residential, industrial, and corporate). The Group also reported the net rental and related income, profit before tax and 
in
vestment properties information by geographic segments, which included Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and a corporate segment composed of entities located in Malta and 
the Netherlands.
In 2023, the Group voluntarily chosen to present the retail business at country level and not to aggregate on a higher 
le
vel the presentation of retail properties’ information, to enhance the relevance of the disclosure.

38.  CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
Contingencies
The Group is subject to income taxes in all jurisdictions and the calculation of the Group’s tax charge and provisions 
f
or income taxes involves a degree of estimation and judgment. There are transactions and calculations for which 
the relevant tax authorities have indicated different interpretations of the fiscal legislation compared to the Group’s 
appr
oach. In such cases, the carrying amount of any tax provisions and charges are determined based on the manner 
in which tax assessments are expected to be resolved, and the stage of negotiations or discussions with the relevant 
tax authorities. There may be significant uncertainty regarding the final outcome of tax proceedings, which in many 
ins
tances, will only be concluded after a number of years.
A number of Group entities in Romania have recently been subject to tax inspections by the Romanian Tax Authorities 
(“R
TA”). For three entities, the tax inspections have been finalized, resulting in additional tax liabilities imposed by the 
R
TA totalling €2.5 million, on the grounds of the RTA disallowing the deductibility of certain expenses. The RTA’s position 
appears to differ from the Group’s interpretation of the relevant tax laws. On the basis that the Group is unaware of the 
RTA’s position being adopted or implemented as established market practice in Romania or in other CEE countries where 
the Group operates, the Group intends to challenge the conclusions of the RTA as and when appropriate.
The additional tax liabilities imposed have been paid by the Group and a related tax receivable has been recognised 
based on management
’s assessment of the expected outcome of challenging the RTA position as noted above.
There are currently tax audits ongoing at different stages for other Romanian subsidiaries, which are not finalized by 
the publica
tion date of these financial statements. In respect of these ongoing tax audits, no additional tax liabilities 
have been recorded in the financial statements, as management believes an additional tax assessment is not warranted. 
Management has calc
ulated a variety of scenarios for tax contingencies, using different sets of potential outcomes with 
r
espect to the relevant tax assessments, resulting in a weighted average value of potential impact of additional tax 
liabilities imposed by authorities of €9.8 million.
Legal matters
The Group operates in a complex legal and regulatory environment that exposes it to various risks, and evaluates all 
f
acts and assesses the implications that could have a material effect on the financial statements. To the extent the Group 
is in
volved in reviews, procedures, information requests and other assessments, including regulatory or tax matters, 
different outcomes are possible, which may result in further regulatory or tax investigations, litigations or sanctions.
Guarantees
As at 31 December 2023, the Group had received letters of guarantee from tenants worth €132,297 thousand 
(31 December 2022: €108,406 thousand) and from suppliers worth €29,789 thousand (31 December 2022: €62,692 
thousand) related to ongoing developments.

Commitments
In 2024, the Group estimates to invest €178 million in development and capital expenditure related to its ongoing 
pr
ojects or new development opportunities, out of which only a portion is already contracted at reporting date.

in F
ebruary 2023, as a result of the voting on the Extraordinary General Meeting (‘EGM’) held in November 2021, the Company implemented three possible 
alternatives for settlement of its distribution: capital repayment (default option), dividend out of accumulated profit and scrip issue, the latter one at the 
discr
etion of the Board. For further details on distribution options impacting the reporting period, please refer to Note 16.
Previous to the above-mentioned redomiciliation and voting on the EGM, the two alternatives for settlement of the distribution were dividend out of profit 
(default option) and scrip issue, the latter one at the discretion of the Board.

Notes to the Separate 
Financial S
tatements
41.  BASIS OF PREPARATION
The separate financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’), the SAICA Financial 
Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee, Financial Pronouncements as issued by the Financial 
Reporting Standards Council, the JSE Listings Requirements, International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as 
adopted by the European Union and with Title 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
In case no other policies are mentioned, refer to the accounting policies as described in the accounting policies in 
the C
onsolidated Financial Statements. For an appropriate interpretation, the Company financial statements of NEPI 
R
ockcastle N.V. should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The separate financial statements are presented in Euro (“€”, “EUR”) thousands unless otherwise stated, which is the 
Company’s functional and presentation currency.
The Company’s separate financial statements include intra-group balances and transactions, investments in subsidiaries 
and any gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions. The Company’s investments in 
subsidiaries are subject to impairment testing annually, if indicators of impairment exist.
Management has prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis. Having considered the potential impact 
of the conflict in Ukraine and the overall macroeconomic environment on the Company’s and the wider NEPI Rockcastle 
Group revenues, profits, cash flows, operations, liquidity position and debt facilities, management concluded that despite 
the market events generated by these circumstances during 2023 and subsequent to the year-end, there are no material 
uncertainties relating to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
42.  SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The material accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all periods presented.
The following accounting policies presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements are relevant for the Company only 
financial statements:
3.8.  Financial assets
3.11. Cash and cash equivalents
3.16. Accumulated 
profit
3.19. Earnings distribution
3.24. Standards issued but not yet effective and not early adopted
42.1 Financial liabilities – measurement categories
Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and classified and subsequently measured at amortised cost, 
e
xcept for financial liabilities at FVTPL: this classification is applied to interest rate derivatives and other financial 
liabilities designated as such at initial recognition.
Financial guarantee contracts are recognised as a financial liability at the time the guarantee is issued. The liability is 
initially measur
ed at fair value and subsequently at the higher of:
• the amount determined in accordance with the expected credit loss model under IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, and
• the amount initially recognised less, where appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance 
with the principles of IFRS 15 R
evenue from Contracts with Customers.
The fair value of financial guarantees is determined based on the present value of the difference in cash flows between 
the contractual payments required under the debt instrument and the payments that would be required without the 
guarantee, or the estimated amount that would be payable to a third party for assuming the obligations.
Guarantee fee income represent the premium received for the guarantee granted by the Company to its subsidiary and is 
r
ecognised in the income statement in Guarantee fee income line on a straight line basis over the life of the guarantee.
42.2 Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. An impairment loss is recognised 
f
or the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the 
higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. At each reporting period investments in subsidiaries 
306 NEPI R ockcastle N.V.

Page 307:
are assessed subject to any indicators of impairment. The impairment test itself is carried when such indicators exist. An 
impairment los
s is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. 
Assets that have suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
42.3 Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value, generally at the amount of consideration that is unconditional. The 
C
ompany holds the trade receivables with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows and therefore measures 
them subsequently a
t amortised cost using the effective interest method. If collection is expected in one year or less, 
the
y are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.
Trade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators that there is no 
reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others, the failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment plan with 
the Company.
42.4 Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses are recognised on an accrual basis.
42.5 Dividend income
Dividends are recognised as income in the Statement of comprehensive income when the Company’s right to receive 
pa
yment is established.
42.6 Interest income
Interest income is recognised on a time-proportionate basis using the effective interest method.
42.7 Taxation
Current income tax and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from, or paid to, taxation 
authorities. T
he tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted, or substantively enacted, 
by the reporting date. Current income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised directly in equity 
and not in the Statement of comprehensive income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns 
with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions 
where appropriate.
Output Value Added Tax (VAT) related to sales is payable to tax authorities on either the collection of receivables from 
c
ustomers or the delivery of services to customers depending on which occurs first. Input VAT is generally recoverable 
agains
t output VAT upon receipt of the invoice. VAT relating to sales and purchases is recognised in the Statement of 
financial position on a net basis and is disclosed separately as an asset or liability, as the case may be. Where provision 
has been made for impairment of receivables, the loss is recorded for the gross amount of the debt, including VAT.
42.8 Share-based payments
To date, NEPI Rockcastle has initiated two types of incentive programs that offered share-based payments in exchange 
f
or services provided to it by its directors and employees (equity-settled transactions), which are detailed below:
a. Purchase Offers with a vesting component – Share Purchase Scheme (“NRP SPS”)
This program was put in place before the 2017 merger of the former groups New Europe Property Investments plc 
(“NEPI”) and R
ockcastle Global Real Estate Company Ltd (“Rockcastle”). Under this program, participants were granted 
loans to acquire shares in the Company at fair value at the grant date. These loans were classified as “loan to participants 
in the inc
entive plan” and included in Other long-term assets (Note 46). The loans are carried at amortised cost and 
the ac
crued interest is recognised as finance income in the Statement of comprehensive income. The costs under this 
pr
ogram are nil.
b. Debt free Long-Term Share Incentive Plan with a vesting component (“LTSIP”)
This program was put in place after the 2017 merger of the former groups NEPI and Rockcastle. Under this incentive 
plan, shar
es may be issued by the Company to executive directors and other key personnel for no cash consideration. 
Awards under this plan are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and are based on the performance of the Group 
and the employees. The costs related to the LTSIP are measured based on the fair value of the shares at the grant date 
and are recognized in the Company’s financial statements over the vesting period as an increase in the investment in 
the subsidiaries, as the emplo
yees receiving the awards are providing services to the subsidiaries of the Company. The 
correspondent credit is recognised in Other reserves in the Statement of changes in equity.
Annual Report 2023 30 7

Page 308:
In the accounts of the subsidiaries, an expense for the grant date fair value of the award is recognised over the vesting 
period, with the cr
edit recognised in equity. The credit to equity is treated as a capital contribution, because the 
Company is compensating the subsidiaries’ employees with no recharge to the subsidiaries.
43.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors which are 
c
onsidered reasonable under the circumstances. These are used to make judgements about the carrying values of assets 
and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and associated assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
r
ecognised in the period when the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the 
r
evision and future periods if the revision affects both.
Judgements and estimates that can cause a significant adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within 
the ne
xt financial year are detailed below.
Impairment of investments in subsidiaries
The Company has an investment in a Nepiom Limited that acts as intermediary holding and financing vehicle. That 
entity has an in
vestment in NE Property B.V. which holds investments in all the operating subsidiaries of the Group. Its 
consolidated net assets value consists mainly of investment properties at fair value, as well as other items for which 
the carrying amount is considered to approximate fair value (loans, working capital items), therefore it is used as a 
recoverable amount in the impairment calculation. When the investments in subsidiaries are higher than the subsidiaries 
net assets value, the carrying value of that investment is reduced.
44.  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company has exposure to the following risks due to its use of financial instruments: credit, liquidity, and market, 
including currency and interest rate. This note presents information about the Company’s exposure to each, as well as its 
objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk.
The fair value of all 
financial instruments is substantially in line with their carrying amounts as reflected on the Statement 
of financial position.
44.1 Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
c
ontractual obligations and arises principally from the Company’s group receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and 
financial guarantees.
The exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is set out below:
Credit exposure on financial instruments excluding exposure to 
guarantees granted Note 31 Dec 2023 31 Dec 2022
in € thousand
Loans to participants in Share Purchase Scheme (including accrued interest) 49 3,451 4,205
Trade and other receivables 47 25,368 8,028
Cash and cash equivalents 48 14,750 2,489
Total 43,569 14,722
Included in the “Trade and other receivables” above, there is an annual guarantee fee that the Company charges to one 
of its indir
ect subsidiaries, NE Property BV (“NEBV”), for its role as a guarantor under the external financing agreements 
c
oncluded by NEBV, namely issued fixed coupon bonds and unsecured revolving credit facilities. At 31 December 2023, 
the balanc
e of guarantee fee receivable from NEBV was of €21,540 thousand (31 December 2022: €5,445 thousand). The 
Company has assessed the liability for financial guarantees as at 31 December 2023 in accordance with the accounting 
policy and concluded that the amount is immaterial.
In accordance with the Group’s external unsecured financing agreements, the Company has guaranteed the due and 
punctual pa
yment of all sums from time to time payable by NEBV under those agreements in case of non-payment by 
the latter. The value of NEBV liabilities (excluding future interest) towards its creditors under above mentioned financing 
agreements at 31 December 2023 was of €2,072,501 thousand (31 December 2022: €2,198,980 thousand).
The Company has assessed the fair value of the liability for financial guarantee at inception being immaterial. As at 
31 December 2023 the respective financial liability has been measured in accordance with the accounting policy at the 
higher of Expected Credit Loss allowance and amount initially recognized. The ECL allowance amount was determined to 
be immaterial considering the total exposure for amounts guaranteed and NEBV’s credit risk.
308 NEPI R ockcastle N.V.

Page 309:
For cash and cash equivalents, the banks’ credit ratings, as well as exposure per each bank are constantly monitored at 
the le
vel of the Group. At 31 December 2023,97% of the Company's cash was held with investment-grade rated banks 
(31 December 2022: 78%):
Cash and cash equivalents 31 Dec 2023 31 Dec 2022
Held with investment-grade rated banks (rated by Moody's)
A1 97% -
A2 - 40%
Aa3 - 38%
Held with not rated banks 3% 22%
Total 100% 100%
The balance of loans to participants in the Share Purchase Scheme is not considered to present credit risk as these are 
guar
anteed with shares (see details in Note 49).
44.2 Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations when due. The Company’s 
appr
oach to managing this risk ensures, as far as possible, it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities 
when due
, under normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to its 
reputation. To ensure this occurs, the Company prepares budgets, cash flow analyses and forecasts, which enable the 
Dir
ectors to assess the level of financing required for future periods. Budgets and projections are used to assess any 
futur
e potential investments and are compared to existing funds to evaluate the nature, and extent of any future funding 
requirements. All financial liabilities are due within 12 months.
Ability to meet financial obligation when due is influenced by the fact that the Company has guaranteed the due and 
punctual pa
yment of all sums from time to time payable by NEBV under those agreements in case of non-payment 
by the latter, as described in Note 44.1. The undiscounted cash flows which the Company is exposed to amounts to 
€2,238,5
38 thousand (2022: €2,505,727 thousand) which becomes payable on demand only upon default by NEBV.
44.3 Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates or equity prices will 
affect
 the Company’s fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is 
t
o manage market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising returns. The carrying value of financial 
assets and liabilities approximates their fair value.
44.3.1 Currency risk
Company’s current assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk on purchases and receivables denominated 
in South A
frican rand (ZAR). Cash inflows received in other currencies than Euro are converted to Euro using the spot 
r
ate available on the collection date. The amount converted to Euro is the net amount of cash inflow in a foreign currency 
and the es
timated cash outflow in the same currency. The Company applies this policy to control its exposures in respect 
of monetary as
sets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the one cash inflows are received in. Sensitivities 
of profit or loss to reasonably possible changes in exchange rates applied at the financial position date relative to 
c
urrencies other than EUR, with all other variables such as interest rates held constant, are immaterial.
44.3.2 Interest rate risk
Sensitivity analysis for interest bearing financial instruments
A change of 100 basis points (bps) in interest rates would have increased/(decreased) equity and profit for the years 
pr
esented below. Calculations are based on the cash and loans balances outstanding at the respective balance sheet 
dates. Cash and loans balances are subject to change over the year. This analysis assumes that all other variables, 
particularly foreign currency rates, remain constant. All sensitivity analysis calculations presented below are before tax.

45.  INVESTMENTS IN AND LOANS TO SUBSIDIARIES
At 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, the Company held 100% ownership in Nepiom Limited, a company 
inc
orporated in Malta. Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
As described below, during 2022, as a result of the offset between the existing loan receivable from and loan payable 
to Nepiom, a portion of the remaining loan receivable was assigned and transferred to NEBV, a wholly owned subsidiary 
of Nepiom, partly through a loan note from NEBV (€100.5 million) and partly through an increase in equity of NEBV in 
form of a B-share (€91.2 million). The resulting participation in NEBV was subsequently extinguished by repayment of the 
B-share in cash by NEBV.
The movements in investment in subsidiaries are presented below:

Balance as at the end of the year - -
During 2022, the loan receivable from Nepiom was reduced by way of an offset with the outstanding amount of the 
loan pa
yable to Nepiom disclosed in note 52. Following the offset, the remaining portion of the loan was assigned and 
tr
ansferred to NEBV, partly through a loan note from NEBV (€100.5 million) and partly through an increase in equity of 
NEBV in form of a B-share (€91.2 million). The loan note receivable from NEBV was subsequently fully extinguished by 
way of an offset against the loan payable to NEBV, disclosed in Note 52.
No securities or guarantees have been granted for loans to subsidiaries. Interest rates on the loan granted to subsidiaries

49.  SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The NEPI Rockcastle Group has incentive plans to reward performance and align the interests of executive directors and 
k
ey individuals with those of the shareholders.
NEPI Rockcastle Group’s current incentive plan (“Incentive Plan”) was approved by Company’s shareholders at an EGM 
da
ted 16 November 2022. The Incentive Plan replaces the initial plan that was approved at the merger between NEPI 
and Rockcastle. The aim of the plan is to incentivise directors and employees to meet the Group’s short-term and long-
term objectives by giving such participants an opportunity to receive performance-based Awards (in cash or shares), 
on short-term (immediate settlement in cash or shares) or long-term (shares with a vesting component). The Board 
determines which executive directors are eligible to participate in the Incentive Plan, and the allocation of incentives, 
based on key performance indicators. The executive directors determine which key employees are eligible to participate 
in the Incentive Plan, and the allocation of incentives is discretionary, based on key performance indicators and other 
considerations regarding the employees’ performance.  
To date, NEPI Rockcastle has initiated two types of incentive programs that offered share-based payments in exchange 
f
or services provided to it by its directors and employees (equity-settled transactions), which are detailed below.
a. Purchase Offers (“SPS”)
Under this program, loans were granted to participants in the share purchase schemes (the “Share Purchase Scheme” or 
“SPS”) t
o buy shares, the repayment of which could be made in part out of the distribution payable in relation to the 
shares (the “NRP SPS”). Of the shares initially subscribed for, 20% vested annually. The Group offered each participant 
the immedia
te right to subscribe for the permitted number of shares at their market value, less a maximum discount of 
5%, together with a loan to fund the purchase. Each loan carried interest at the weighted average rate that the Group 
can borrow money. Loans are payable in full, together with interest, ten years after its subscription date, but could be 
repaid earlier. The Company has security interests that ensure the repayment of the principal and interest on the loan 
given to participants. The NRP SPS is a full recourse scheme (i.e., recourse in relation to loans granted is not limited 
to shares issued). Pending repayment of the loan, the distributions on such shares are used to repay loan interest. Any 
excess distribution after interest payment is used to repay the loan.
No shares were issued during 2023 and 2022 under the NRP SPS.

Loans to participants under the Share Purchase Scheme (in € thousand) 3,451 4,205
b. Debt free Long-Term Share Incentive Plan with a vesting component (“LTSIP”)
Under this incentive plan, shares are awarded by the Group to executive directors and other key employees for no cash 
c
onsideration. For key employees, shares are awarded to participants on condition of employment in the Group for the 
next three years (vesting period), with shares being vested proportionally over each year of the corresponding vesting 
periods (tranche vesting). For executive directors, shares are awarded subject to a full vesting of them at the end of 
three years (cliff vesting) plus a further two-year lock-up period, during which the vested shares cannot be disposed of 
b
y the directors. Shares awarded under LTSIP cannot be disposed of or otherwise encumbered up to their respective 
vesting dates.

Number of shares granted during the year 161,627 137,945
Fair value at the grant date (in € thousand) 945 838
The maximum number of shares which could be offered for subscription under the Incentive Plan is 5% of the issued 
shar
e capital of the Company at the end of any financial year prior to each award, provided that such number shall not 
e
xceed 30,449,745 shares. The number of shares that remained available for issue in terms of the Incentive Plan were 
as follows:
31 Dec 2023 31 Dec 2022
Number of shares that remain available for issue at year-end 27,444,043 28,226,835
The costs related to the LTSIP are measured based on the fair value of the shares at the grant date and are recognized 
in the C
ompany’s financial statements over the vesting period as an increase in the investment in the subsidiaries, as the 
employees receiving the awards are providing services to the subsidiaries of the Company. The correspondent credit is 
recognised in Other reserves in the Statement of changes in equity.
In the accounts of the subsidiaries, an expense for the grant date fair value of the award is recognised over the vesting 
period, with the cr
edit recognised in equity. The credit to equity is treated as a capital contribution, because the 
Company is compensating the subsidiaries’ employees with no recharge to the subsidiaries.
50.  DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS
On 29 July 2022, the Company concluded a sale and purchase agreement with NEBV to sell the economic ownership 
of all its outstanding interest rate caps for €13,182 thousand representing the fair value of those caps. The Company 
remains the legal counterparty under the interest rate caps in relation to the contacting banks until the expiration of the 
instruments. Any amount received from the banks under the sold hedge instruments is to be transferred immediately to 
NEBV and respectively, any amount due to the banks under the instruments is to be recovered by the Company from 
NEBV, according to the sale agreement.

Provisions in the Articles of 
As
sociation relating to profit
Pursuant to article 26 of the Articles of Association of the 
C
ompany, the Board may appropriate the profits realised 
during a financial year to form reserves or distribute 
them to shareholders, subject to applicable law. To the 
extent permitted by applicable law all sums standing 
to reserves may be applied from time to time, at the 
discretion of the Board, for any other purpose to which 
the 
profits of the Company may properly be applied. 
P
ending such application, the reserves may either be 
employed in the business of the Company or be invested 
in such investments as the Board thinks 
fit so that it shall 
not be necessary to keep any investment constituting
the reserve separate or distinct from any other investment 
of the C
ompany. A proposal to pay a distribution will 
be dealt with as a separate agenda item at the General 
Meeting. Distributions from the Company's distributable 
reserves are made pursuant to a resolution of the Board 
and will not require a resolution from the General Meeting. 
The Company's policy on reserves and dividends shall 
be determined and can be amended by the Board. The 
adoption and thereafter each amendment of the policy on 
reserves and dividends shall be discussed and accounted 
for at the General Meeting under a separate agenda item.

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2023 INCLUDED IN THE 
ANNU
AL REPORT
Our opinion
We have audited the financial statements 2023 of NEPI 
ROCKCASTLE N.V. based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
In our opinion the accompanying financial statements give 
a true and f
air view of the financial position of NEPI 
ROCK
CASTLE N.V. as at 31 December 2023, and of its 
result and its cash flows for 2023 in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted in 
the European Union (EU‑IFRSs) and with Part 9 of Book 2 
of the Dutch Civil Code.
The financial statements comprise:
• the consolidated and separate statement of financial 
position as at 31 December 2023
• the following statements for 2023: the consolidated 
and separ
ate statements of comprehensive income, 
changes in equity and cash flows
• the notes comprising material accounting policy 
inf
ormation and other explanatory information
Basis for our opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch 
la
w, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. 
Our responsibilities under those standards are further 
described in the Our responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements section of our report.
We are independent of NEPI ROCKCASTLE N.V. (the 
c
ompany or the group) in accordance with the EU 
Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory 
audit of public-interest entities, the “Wet toezicht 
accountantsorganisaties” (Wta, Audit firms supervision 
act), the “Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid 
van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten” (ViO, 
Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a 
regulation with respect to independence) and other 
relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. 
Furthermore, we have complied with the “Verordening 
gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants” (VGBA, Dutch 
Code of Ethics).
We believe the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion.
INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF OUR OPINION
We designed our audit procedures in the context of our 
audit of the 
financial statements as a whole and in forming 
our opinion ther
eon. The following information in support 
of our opinion and any findings were addressed in this 
c
ontext, and we do not provide a separate opinion or 
conclusion on these matters.
Our understanding of the business
NEPI ROCKCASTLE N.V. is a multinational owner and 
oper
ator of shopping centers in Central and Eastern 
Europe, with presence in nine countries and an investment 
portfolio of €6.8 billion.
The group is structured in components, and we tailored 
our gr
oup audit approach accordingly. We paid specific 
attention in our audit to a number of areas driven by 
the oper
ations of the group, as set out in our Key Audit 
Matter, and in our risk assessment.
We determined materiality and identified and assessed 
the risk
s of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error in order to 
design audit pr
ocedures responsive to those risks and to 
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion.
Materiality
Materiality €66 million (2022: €60 million)
Benchmark 
applied
1.5% of total shareholders’ equity as at 
31 December
 2023
Explanation
We determined materiality based on our 
unders
tanding of the company’s business and 
our perception of the financial information 
needs of users of the financial statements. We 
consider total equity an important metric for 
the 
financial position of the company.
We determined materiality consistent with 
pr
evious year.
We have also taken into account misstatements 
and/
or possible misstatements that in our opinion are 
material for the users of the financial statements for 
qualita
tive reasons.
We agreed with the audit committee of the board 
of dir
ectors (hereinafter: the audit committee) that 
misstatements in excess of €3.3 million which are 
identified during the audit, would be reported to them, 
as well as smaller misstatements that in our view must be 
reported on qualitative grounds.

Scope of the group audit
NEPI ROCKCASTLE N.V. is at the head of a group of 
entities. T
he financial information of this group is included 
in the consolidated financial statements.
Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, 
w
e are also responsible for directing, supervising and 
performing the group audit. In this respect we have 
determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures 
to be carried out for group entities. Decisive were the size 
and/or the risk profile of the group entities or operations. 
On this basis, w
e selected group entities for which an 
audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set 
of financial information or specific items.
Our group audit mainly focused on significant group 
entities. F
ollowing our assessment of the risk of 
material misstatement to NEPI ROCKCASTLE N.V.’s 
financial statements, we have selected 25 components 
which required an audit of the complete financial 
information (Full Scope components). Additionally, we 
select
ed 29 components requiring audit procedures on 
specific account balances or specified audit procedures 
on significant accounts that we considered had the 
pot
ential for the greatest impact on the financial 
statements (Specific or Specified Scope components). 
Furthermore, we performed centralized review procedures 
on an additional 9 components. For the remaining 
components, we performed selected other procedures, 
including analytical review to respond to potential risks 
of material misstatements to the 
financial statements that 
we identified.
We sent instructions to component auditors, covering 
the 
significant areas and the information required to 
be reported to us. Based on our risk assessment, 
we determined the level of involvement in component 
audits. We have visited the component team in Romania, 
reviewed key local working papers and conclusions, 
met with local management teams and obtained an 
understanding of key processes. We interacted regularly 
with the component team during various stages of 
the audit, and evaluated the reporting from component 
auditors. Together, the full, 
specific, and review scope 
pr
ocedures represent 99% of the group’s investment 
properties, and 99% of total rental revenues.
INVESTMENT PROPERTIES RENTAL INCOME 
Full scope Speciﬁc or speciﬁed scope Review scope Other procedures
By performing the procedures mentioned above at 
c
omponents of the group, together with additional 
procedures at group level, we have been able to obtain 
sufficient and appropriate audit evidence about the 
group’s financial information to provide an opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements.
Teaming and use of specialists
We ensured that the audit teams both at group and 
a
t component levels included the appropriate skills and 
competences which are needed for the audit of a listed 
client in the real estate industry. We included specialists in 
the areas of IT audit, forensics, and income tax and have 
made use of our own experts in the area of valuations of 
real estate in the various countries of operations.
Our focus on climate-related risks and the 
ener
gy transition
Climate change and the energy transition are high 
on the public agenda. Is
sues such as CO2 reduction 
impact financial reporting, as these issues entail risks 
for the business operation, the valuation of assets and 
provisions or the sustainability of the business model and 
access to financial markets of companies with a larger 
C
O2 footprint. The board of directors summarized the 
company’s commitments and obligations in relation to 
climate change and reported in the ‘Directors’ Report’ and 
the ‘Sustainability Report’ how the company is addressing 
climate-related and environmental risks.
As part of our audit of the 
financial statements, we 
evaluated the extent to which climate-related risks and 
the effects of the energy transition and the Company’s 
c
ommitments and (constructive) obligations, are taken 
into account in estimates and significant assumptions. 
Furthermor
e, we read the annual report and considered 
whether there is any material inconsistency between the 
non-financial information and the financial statements.
Based on the audit procedures performed, we do not 
deem clima
te-related risks to have a material impact on 
the financial reporting judgments, estimates or significant 
assumptions as at 31 December 2023.

Our focus on fraud and non-compliance with 
la
ws and regulations
Our responsibility
Although we are not responsible for preventing fraud or 
non-c
ompliance and we cannot be expected to detect 
non-compliance with all laws and regulations, it is our 
responsibility to obtain reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
Our audit response related to fraud risks
We 
identified and assessed the risks of material 
misstatements of the financial statements due to fraud. 
During our audit w
e obtained an understanding of 
the company and its environment and the components 
of the system of internal control, including the risk 
assessment process and the board of directors’ process 
for responding to the risks of fraud and monitoring the 
system of internal control, as well as the outcomes.
We refer to the risk management & compliance section 
of the annual r
eport for the board of directors’ risk 
assessment after consideration of potential fraud risks.
We evaluated the design and relevant aspects of the 
s
ystem of internal control and in particular the fraud risk 
assessment, as well as the code of ethics, whistleblowing 
policy and incident registration. We evaluated the design 
and the implementation of internal controls designed to 
mitigate fraud risks.
As part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we 
e
valuated fraud risk factors with respect to financial 
reporting fraud, misappropriation of assets, and bribery 
and c
orruption, in close co-operation with our forensic 
specialists. We evaluated whether these factors indicate 
that a risk of material misstatement due to fraud 
is present.
We incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit. 
W
e also considered the outcome of our other audit 
procedures and evaluated whether any findings were 
indica
tive of fraud or non-compliance.
We addressed the risks related to management override 
of c
ontrols, as this risk is present in all companies. 
For these risks we have performed procedures among 
other things to evaluate key accounting estimates for 
management bias that may represent a risk of material 
misstatement due to fraud, in particular relating to 
important judgment areas and significant accounting 
es
timates as disclosed in Note 4. ‘Significant accounting 
es
timates and judgements in applying accounting policies’ 
of the notes to the financial statements. We have also 
used da
ta analysis to identify and address high-risk 
journal entries and evaluated the business rationale (or 
the lack thereof) of significant extraordinary transactions, 
including those with related parties.
When identifying and assessing fraud risks, we presumed 
tha
t there are risks of fraud in revenue recognition 
from investment properties. We considered the risk of 
recognition of gross rental income and service charge 
income, including lease incentives and indexations, in the 
correct period. We designed and performed our audit 
procedures relating to revenue recognition responsive to 
this presumed fraud risk. These procedures included use 
of correlation related data analytics, reconciliation of rent 
rolls to reported revenue, and analysis of underlying lease 
agreements, for terms and conditions that would have an 
impact on revenue recognition.
We considered available information and made enquiries 
of r
elevant executives, directors, internal audit, legal, 
compliance, human resources and regional directors, and 
the Board of Directors.
The fraud risk we identified, enquiries and other available 
inf
ormation did not lead to specific indications for fraud 
or suspect
ed fraud potentially materially impacting the 
view of the financial statements.
Our audit response related to risks of non-compliance 
with laws and regulations
We performed appropriate audit procedures regarding 
c
ompliance with the provisions of those laws and 
regulations that have a direct effect on the determination 
of ma
terial amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. Furthermore, we assessed factors related to 
the risk
s of non-compliance with laws and regulations 
that could reasonably be expected to have a material 
effect on the financial statements from our general 
indus
try experience, through discussions with the board 
of directors, reading minutes, inspection of internal audit 
and compliance reports, and performing substantive tests 
of details of classes of transactions, account balances 
or disclosures.
We also inspected lawyers’ letters and correspondence 
with r
egulatory authorities and remained alert to any 
indication of (suspected) non-compliance throughout 
the audit. In case of potential non-compliance with 
laws and regulations that may have a material effect 
on the financial statements, we assessed whether the 
c
ompany has an adequate process in place to evaluate the 
impact of non-compliance for its activities and financial 
reporting and, where relevant, whether the company 
implement
ed remediation plans. Finally, we obtained 
written representations that all known instances of non-
compliance with laws and regulations have been disclosed 
to us.
Our audit response related to going concern
As disclosed in section ‘Statement of compliance’ in Note 
2 t
o the financial statements, the financial statements 
have been prepared on a going concern basis. When 
preparing the financial statements, the board of directors 
made a specific assessment of the company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern and to continue its 
operations for the foreseeable future.
We discussed and evaluated the 
specific assessment 
with the board of directors exercising professional 
judgment and maintaining professional skepticism. We 
322 NEPI R ockcastle N.V.

Page 323:
considered whether the board of directors’ going concern 
as
sessment, based on our knowledge and understanding 
obtained through our audit of the financial statements 
or otherwise
, contains all relevant events or conditions 
that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability 
t
o continue as a going concern. If we conclude that 
a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures 
in the 
financial statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequa
te, to modify our opinion.
Based on our procedures performed, we did not 
identify ma
terial uncertainties about going concern. Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up 
t
o the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events 
or conditions may cause a company to cease to continue 
as a going concern.
Our key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
pr
ofessional judgment, were of most significance in our 
audit of the financial statements. We have communicated 
our key audit matter to the audit committee. The key 
audit matter is not a comprehensive reflection of all 
ma
tters discussed.
Valuation of investment property in use
Risk
The investment property in use of NEPI ROCKCASTLE N.V. comprises of income generating assets in Central and 
Eas
tern Europe (‘’CEE’’). The total investment property in use as at 31 December 2023 amounts to €6.6 billion (2022: 
€6.3 billion) r
epresenting 87% (2022: 89%) of total assets. The portfolio consists mainly of retail properties.
As disclosed in section ‘Valuation of investment property’ in Note 4 to the financial statements, the fair value of 
in
vestment property in use is determined by management’s external appraisers using the Income method. The Income 
method involves assumptions of the following inputs to the valuation: estimated rental value from the properties, 
including an exit, or terminal value, discount rate and capitalisation rate for these cash flows.
The valuation of investment property in use has been identified as a key audit matter, considering its inherently 
judgmental na
ture and its significance to the financial statements as a whole. Specialist expertise is required to value 
the in
vestment properties in use and requires the use of significant judgement in relation to the stated assumptions 
used as inputs t
o the valuation. The use of different valuation inputs could produce significantly different estimates of 
fair value.
In the current financial year, the macroeconomic environment in Europe — characterised by high inflation, interest rate 
hik
es, and geopolitical instability — have resulted in increased judgement being applied by management’s external 
appraisers relating to the assumptions used in the valuation of investment properties and thus required significant 
audit attention, as disclosed in Note 5 to the financial statements.
The disclosures are set out in the consolidated financial statements in Note 8 to the financial statements.
Our 
audit appr
oach
Our audit procedures included, among others, the following:
• We obtained an understanding and evaluated management’s internal process for determining the fair value of 
in
vestment property in use;
• We evaluated whether the Income method used by management’s external appraisers is appropriate in the 
c
ontext of generally accepted property valuation techniques in the real estate market and EU-IFRSs;
• We assessed the competence, capability and objectivity of management’s external appraisers, referring 
t
o their qualifications, relevant industry experience and certification by the Royal Institution of Chartered 
Surv
eyors (“RICS”);
• We engaged our own valuation specialists, who have experience and understanding of the local markets, to assess 
the r
easonability of valuation of the investment property in use. This included evaluating the assumptions made 
by management in determining the discount rate and capitalisation rate, particularly in light of the effects of 
the c
urrent macroeconomic market conditions in Europe on market-related assumptions. We carried this out by 
assessing and, where possible, testing the reasonability of assumptions against independent market data;
• We assessed the reasonability of the estimated rental value used by management’s external appraisers by 
agr
eeing a sample of the inputs used by the external appraisers with contractual documentation and rent roll data;
• We evaluated the appropriateness of the disclosures in terms of the requirements of IAS 40, Investment Property 
and IFRS 13, F
air Value Measurement which includes evaluating the sensitivity of the assumptions on the fair value 
of the investment property in use.
Key 
observ
ations
Based on our procedures performed, we consider the valuation of investment property in use and related disclosures 
in the financial statements reasonable in the context of EU-IFRSs.
REPORT ON OTHER INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THE ANNUAL REPORT
The annual report contains other information in 
addition t
o the financial statements and our auditor’s 
report thereon.
Based on the following procedures performed, we 
c
onclude that the other information:
• is consistent with the financial statements and does 
not c
ontain material misstatements
• contains the information as required by Part 9 of Book 
2 of the Dut
ch Civil Code for the management report 
and the other information as required by Part 9 of 
Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and as required by 
Sections 2:135b and 2:145 sub‑section 2 of the Dutch 
Civil Code for the remuneration report.
We have read the other information. Based on our 
kno
wledge and understanding obtained through our 
audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we

of the other inf
ormation, including the management 
report in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the 
Dut

package complies with the RTS on ESEF.
We performed our examination in accordance with 
Dut
ch law, including Dutch Standard 3950N ’Assurance-
opdrachten inzake het voldoen aan de criteria voor 
het opstellen van een digitaal verantwoordingsdocument’ 
(assurance engagements relating to compliance with 
criteria for digital reporting). Our examination included 
amongst others:
• Obtaining an understanding of the Company’s 
financial reporting process, including the preparation 
of the reporting package
• Identifying and assessing the risks that the annual 
r
eport does not comply in all material respects with 
the RTS on ESEF and designing and performing 
further assurance procedures responsive to those risks 
to provide a basis for our opinion, including:
»Obtaining the reporting package and performing 
v
alidations to determine whether the reporting 
package containing the Inline XBRL instance 
document and the XBRL extension taxonomy 
files,
 has been prepared in accordance with the 
technical specifications as included in the RTS 
on ESEF
» Examining the information related to the 
c
onsolidated financial statements in the reporting 
package to determine whether all required mark-
ups have been applied and whether these are in 
accordance with the RTS on ESEF.
DESCRIPTION OF RESPONSIBILITIES REGARDING THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Responsibilities of the Board of Directors for 
the 
financial statements
The board of directors is responsible for the preparation 
and f
air presentation of the financial statements in 
accordance with EU-IFRSs and Part 9 of Book 2 of the 
Dutch Civil Code. Furthermore, the board of directors 
is responsible for such internal control as the board 
of directors determines is necessary to enable the 
preparation of the financial statements that are free from 
ma
terial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
As part of the preparation of the financial statements, 
the boar
d of directors is responsible for assessing the 
company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based 
on the financial reporting framework mentioned, the 
board of directors should prepare the financial statements 
using the going c
oncern basis of accounting unless the 
board of directors either intends to liquidate the company 
or to cease operations or has no realistic alternative but 
to do so. The board of directors should disclose events 
and circumstances that may cast 
significant doubt on the 
c
ompany’s ability to continue as a going concern in the 
financial statements.
The audit committee assists the board of directors in 
fulfilling
 its responsibilities for overseeing the company’s 
financial reporting process.

Our responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements
Our objective is to plan and perform the audit 
engagement in a manner tha
t allows us to obtain 
sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion.
Our audit has been performed with a high, but not 
absolut
e, level of assurance, which means we may not 
detect all material errors and fraud during our audit.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
c
onsidered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
ec
onomic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements. The materiality affects the nature, 
timing and e
xtent of our audit procedures and the 
evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on 
our opinion.
We have exercised professional judgment and have 
maintained pr
ofessional skepticism throughout the audit, 
in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, 
ethical requirements and independence requirements. The 
‘Information in support of our opinion’ section above 
includes an informative summary of our responsibilities 
and the work performed as the basis for our opinion.
Our audit further included among others:
•Performing audit procedures responsive to the risks 
identified,
 and obtaining audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion
• Obtaining an understanding of internal control 
r
elevant to the audit in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, 
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on 
the 
effectiveness of the company’s internal control
• Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the r
easonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by the board of directors
• Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and 
c
ontent of the financial statements, including 
the disclosures
• Evaluating whether the financial statements represent 
the underlying tr
ansactions and events in a manner 
that achieves fair presentation
Communication
We communicate with the board of directors regarding, 
among other ma
tters, the planned scope and timing 
of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant findings in internal control that we 
identify during our audit. In this r
espect we also 
submit an additional report to the audit committee in 
accordance with Article 11 of the EU Regulation on specific 
requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest 
entities. T
he information included in this additional report 
is consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor’s report.
We provide the audit committee with a statement that 
w
e have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate with them 
all relationships and other matters that may reasonably 
be thought to bear on our independence, and where 
applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the audit 
c
ommittee, we determine the key audit matters: those 
matters that were of most significance in the audit of 
the financial statements. We describe these matters in our 
auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public 
disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare 
circumstances, not communicating the matter is in the 
public interest.

or’s Report
To the Shareholders of NEPI Rockcastle N.V.
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated and 
Separate Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the consolidated and separate  financial 
statements of NEPI Rockcastle N.V and its subsidiaries 
(‘the group’) set out on pages 248 to 315, which comprise 
of the consolidated and separate statements of  financial 
position as at 31 December 2023, and the consolidated 
and separate statements of comprehensive income, the 
consolidated and separate statements of changes in 
equity and the consolidated and separate statements of 
cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the 
consolidated and separate financial statements, including 
material accounting policies.
In our opinion, the consolidated and separate  financial 
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the 
consolidated and separate financial position of the group 
and company as at 31 December 2023, and its 
consolidated and separate financial performance and 
consolidated and separate cash flows for the year 
then ended in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the Auditor’s 
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated and 
Separate Financial Statements section of our report. We 
are independent of the group and company in accordance 
with the Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors’ 
Code of Professional Conduct for Registered Auditors 
(IRBA Code) and other independence requirements 
applicable to performing audits of financial statements of 
the group and company and in South Africa. We have 
fulfilled
 our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with the IRBA C
ode and in accordance with other 
ethical requirements applicable to performing audits of 
the group and company and in South Africa. The IRBA 
Code is consistent with the corresponding sections of 
the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ 
International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants 
(including International Independence Standards). We 
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient
 and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
prof
essional judgement, were of most significance in 
our audit of the c
onsolidated and separate financial 
statements of the current period. These matters were 
addres
sed in the context of our audit of the consolidated 
and separate financial statements as a whole, and in 
forming our opinion ther
eon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, 
our description of how our audit addressed the matter is 
provided in that context.
We have 
fulfilled the responsibilities described in 
the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements section 
of our report, including in r
elation to these matters. 
Accordingly, our audit included the performance of 
procedures designed to respond to our assessment of 
the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated 
and separate financial statements. The results of our 
audit proc
edures, including the procedures performed to 
address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit 
opinion on the accompanying consolidated and separate 
financial
 statements.
The Key Audit Matter applies solely to the audit of the 
consolida
ted financial statements.

Page 327:
Key Audit Matter How the matter was addressed in the audit
The investment property in use of NEPI Rockcastle N.V. comprises of 
income gener
ating assets in Central and Eastern Europe (‘’CEE’’). 
The total investment property in use as at 31 December 2023 
amounts to €6.6 billion (20
22: €6.3 billion) representing 87% 
(2022: 89%) of total assets. The portfolio consists mainly of 
retail properties.
As disclosed in section ‘Valuation of investment property’ in Note 4 
to the c
onsolidated financial statements, the fair value of investment 
property in use is det
ermined by management’s external appraisers 
using the income approach applying the discounted cash flow 
(“DCF”) method. The DCF method involves assumptions of the 
follo
wing inputs to the valuation: estimated market rental value from 
the properties, including an exit, or terminal value, discount rate and 
capitalisation rate for these cash 
flows.
The valuation of investment property in use has been identified as 
a ke
y audit matter, considering its inherently judgmental nature and 
its significance to the financial statements as a whole. Specialist 
expertise is r
equired to value the investment property in use and 
requires the use of significant judgement in relation to the stated 
as
sumptions used as inputs to the valuation. The use of different 
valuation inputs could produce significantly different estimates of 
fair v
alue.
In the current financial year, the macroeconomic environment in 
Europe — characterised by high inflation, interest rate hikes, and 
geopolitical instability — have resulted in increased judgement 
being applied by management’s external appraisers relating to the 
assumptions used in the valuation of investment properties and thus 
required significant
 audit attention.
The disclosures are set out in the consolidated financial statements 
in Note 8.
Our audit procedures included, among others, the following:
• We obtained an understanding and evaluated management’s
internal pr
ocess for determining the fair value of investment
property in use;
• We evaluated whether the valuation technique used by
management’
s external appraisers is appropriate in the
context of generally accepted property valuation techniques
in the real estate market and International Financial
Reporting Standards;
• We assessed the competence, capability and objectivity
of management’
s external appraisers, referring to their
qualifications, relevant industry experience and certification by
the Ro
yal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (“RICS”);
• We engaged our internal valuation specialists, who have
experienc
e and understanding of the local markets, to assess
the reasonability of management's valuation of the investment
property in use. This included evaluating the assumptions
made by management in determining the discount rate and
capitalisation rate, particularly in light of the effects of
the curr
ent macroeconomic market conditions in Europe on
market-related assumptions. We carried this out by assessing
and, where possible, testing the reasonability of assumptions
against independent market data;
• We assessed the reasonability of the estimated market rental
value used b
y management’s external appraisers by agreeing
a sample of the inputs used by the external appraisers with
contractual documentation and rent roll data;
• We evaluated the appropriateness of the disclosures in terms
of the requir
ements of IAS 40, Investment Property and
IFRS 13, Fair Value Measurement which includes evaluating
the sensitivity of the assumptions on the fair value of the
investment property in use.
In c
onnection with our audit of the consolidated and 
separa
te financial statements, our responsibility is to read 
the other informa
tion and, in doing so, consider whether 
the other information is materially inconsistent with the 
consolidated and separate financial statements or our 
kno
wledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears 
to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we 
have performed, we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of this other information, we are required to 
report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Other Information
The directors are responsible for the other information. 
The other information comprises the information included 
in the 335 pages document titled “NEPI Rockcastle 
Annual Report 2023”, which includes the Directors’ report 
and the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities. The other 
information does not include the consolidated 
or the separate 
financial statements and our auditor’s 
report thereon.
Our opinion on the consolidated and separate  financial 
statements does not cover the other information and we 
do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.

To the Shareholders of NEPI Rockcastle N.V.
Responsibilities of the Directors for the Consolidated and 
Separate Financial Statements
The directors are responsible for the preparation and fair 
pr
esentation of the consolidated and separate financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial 
R
eporting Standards, and for such internal control as the 
dir
ectors determine is necessary to enable the preparation 
of consolidated and separate financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error.
In preparing the consolidated and separate financial 
statements, the directors are responsible for assessing 
the gr
oup and company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate 
the group and company or to cease operations, or have 
no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated 
and Separate Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the c
onsolidated and separate financial 
statements as a whole are free from material 
mis
statement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue 
an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with 
ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and 
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
ec
onomic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
consolidated and separate financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we 
e
xercise professional judgement and maintain professional 
scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the c
onsolidated and separate financial statements, 
whether due t
o fraud or error, design and perform 
audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain 
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to 
pr
ovide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud 
is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud 
may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misr
epresentations, or the override of internal control.
• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant 
t
o the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the 
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness 
of the group and company’s internal control.
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the r
easonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by the directors.
• Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use 
of the going c
oncern basis of accounting and based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions 
that may cast significant doubt on the group and 
company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If 
we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we 
are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report 
to the related disclosures in the consolidated and 
separate financial statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequa
te, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions 
are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 
date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or 
conditions may cause the group and/or the company 
to cease to continue as a going concern.
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
c
ontent of the consolidated and separate financial 
statements, including the disclosures, and whether 
the c
onsolidated and separate financial statements 
r
epresent the underlying transactions and events in a 
manner that achieves fair presentation.
• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding 
the financial information of the entities or business 
activities within the group to express an opinion on 
the consolidated and separate financial statements. 
W
e are responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the group audit. We remain solely 
responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the directors regarding, among 
other ma
tters, the planned scope and timing of the audit 
and significant audit findings, including any significant 
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during 
our audit.
We also provide the directors with a statement that 
w
e have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate with 
them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or 
safeguards applied.
From the matters communicated with the directors, we 
det
ermine those matters that were of most significance 
in the audit of the consolidated and separate financial 
statements of the current period and are therefore the key 
audit ma
tters.
We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless 
la
w or regulation precludes public disclosure about the 
matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we 
determine that a matter should not be communicated in 
our report because the adverse consequences of doing 
so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.
