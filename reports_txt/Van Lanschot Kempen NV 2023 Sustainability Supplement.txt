Our stakeholders
We differentiate between five main groups of stakeholders 
based on the way in which we communicate with them: 
clients, employees, shareholders and bondholders, 
government/regulators and business partners. Regardless 
of the stakeholder group or how we engage, we frequently 
interact with our stakeholders to learn what they expect 
from us. Internally, we assess these expectations in the light 
of our strategy and consider how other stakeholders would 
be affected if they were implemented. 
Suggestions that are in line with our strategy and 
compatible with the interests of other stakeholders may 
entail us introducing new solutions or making policy 
adjustments. We believe that engaging with our 
stakeholders, demonstrating that we take their 
expectations into account, and considering the interests of 
all of our stakeholders, are vital to our purpose: to preserve 
and create wealth for our clients and for society in a 
sustainable way.
The table below outlines the key expectations and 
discussion topics per stakeholder group in 2023. 
Expectations in the table are derived from a variety of 
sources: discussions with clients and periodic client 
satisfaction surveys, meetings with shareholders, and 
analysis of questions and comments from our business 
partners, including our collaborating companies and 
suppliers. For more information on stakeholder 
engagement, see vanlanschotkempen.com/en-nl/about-us/
sustainability/governance-and-stakeholders.

Our 2021–23 materiality matrix
We conduct a materiality assessment every other year to 
identify and evaluate our most significant impacts2. To 
assist with comparison of the most recent matrix (2023) 
with the former one (from 2021), we have added the latter 
on the right. In the materiality matrix, the topics marked in 
bold indicate those deemed to be most material based on 
our 2021 assessment (11 topics out of 20 in total). These 
topics form the basis of our 2022 and 2023 key 
performance indicators (KPIs). The 2023 materiality 
matrix, which forms the basis of our 2024 and 2025 KPIs, 
can be found in our 2023 annual report, p. 26. 
In 2021, our starting point was a longlist of topics, derived 
from external standards and assessments. These were 
reduced to a shortlist by internal experts, based on which 
topics they considered could significantly impact or 
influence our stakeholders. This shortlist  was approved by 
the Management Board, and formed the basis for a survey 
via which stakeholders were asked to assess the extent to 
which each topic influences the decisions they make 
regarding Van Lanschot Kempen. They were asked to 
indicate which five topics on the shortlist were most and 
least important to them when assessing our performance. 
In addition, a group of senior managers ranked the 
significance of the impact Van Lanschot Kempen has via 
each of the topics. This ranking was subsequently cross-
checked with a panel of external sustainability experts, 
after which it was discussed among the Management 
Board members prior to their approval.
The table and matrix on the next page shows the 11 topics 
(out of the 20 in total) deemed most material. The table 
lists the topics in order of materiality. The Global 
Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards were  updated in 
2022 to determine materiality based on an organisation’s 
most significant impacts on the economy, environment 
and people, including human rights – corresponding to the 
horizontal axis of our materiality matrix. In line with this, 
we have added topic 2, "Growth", to the topics we 
consider to be material.
Our 2021-23 materiality matrix 5

Responsible lending policy (results)
After the wind-down of our business loan portfolio, our 
corporate credit exposure is very limited, including the 
exposure to sectors which are more sensitive in 
sustainability terms.
For the past few years, a risk filter has been used to screen 
the sustainability of business loans to avoid negative 
impacts in areas such as environmental issues, labour and 
human rights violations. This process did not identify any 
material sustainability issues in the portfolio.
Progress in implementation
of responsible lending policy
2023 2022 2021
Number of business loans 2,387 2,141 1,808
Of which “potentially high risk” 1 1 16
At the end of 2023, only 1 of our 2,387 business loan 
clients was designated as "potentially high risk", meaning 
that we maintain an engagement with this client to better 
understand their potential involvement in principal 
adverse impacts. 
Our responsible lending policy is in line with the OECD  
Guidelines for multinational enterprises (MNEs) as well as 
with the UNGP. This means that our policy outlines in 
detail our due diligence and engagement process, 
including possible remedy measures, in relation to 
potential negative environmental and social impacts on 
relevant – and affected – stakeholders. For more details 
and reports on our compliance, see

Environmental policy objective
Our environmental impact breaks down into three 
categories. Given the size of our assets under 
management (AuM), the biggest environmental impact we 
make relates to how we invest our clients’ assets. We have 
an extensive responsible investment policy in place for all 
AuM. Our second biggest impact is related to our balance 
sheet. Measures we have taken to manage this impact 
include incorporating sustainability considerations in our 
client due diligence policy; having a responsible lending 
policy in place; and embedding sustainability within our 
residential mortgage proposition. Our smallest but most 
direct climate change impact is via our own operations. 
We have set targets to reduce our impact related to each 
of these categories.
Results for 2023
The graphs on the next page give an overview of our 
carbon reduction for our own operations. We have made a 
clear contribution towards our net-zero ambition since we 
started measuring the footprint of our own organisation in 
2011. In our own organisation, absolute carbon emissions 
in 2023 totalled 2,789 tonnes CO2e, or 1.38 tonnes CO2e 
per FTE (2022: 2,775 tonnes, or 1.45 tonnes CO2e per 
FTE). Our carbon emissions per FTE decreased slightly 
compared with 2022, meaning we remain on track to 
reduce the carbon emissions of our own organisation by at 
least 7% per FTE per year, against a 2019 baseline. 
Starting in 2024, we will step up our ambitions and 
increase our target to reduce the annual average carbon 
intensity per FTE from 7% to 8% per year, against a 2019 
baseline.
The graphs on page 12 give an overview of our carbon 
reduction for our AuM and balance sheet. In 2023, the 
carbon footprint of our balance sheet decreased to 66,288 
tonnes CO2e from 91,7984 in 2022. The largest chunk, the 
carbon footprint of our mortgage portfolio, likely due to 
lower energy consumption because of higher energy 
prices and warmer weather in 2022 than in 2021. On 
average, the energy-efficiency rating of the collateral for 
our residential mortgages improved. 
The aggregate carbon footprint of our AuM for 2023 is 4.0 
million tonnes CO2e and 317 CO2e per million euros 
invested (based on carbon emissions data for 2021). In 
2023, we improved the reporting process for the carbon 
footprint of our AuM by including scope 3 carbon data and 
changing to a different external data provider, which 
means that the carbon footprint and coverage for 2023 
are not comparable with the 2022 figures. 
The tables on page 12 provides an overview of the carbon 
footprint of our loan portfolio and AuM for a selection of 
industries and asset classes respectively, in accordance 
with the Dutch financial sector's climate commitment. 
The breakdown of our loan portfolio's carbon footprint 
further demonstrates the alignment of our portfolio with 
our profile as a wealth manager – being mainly focused on 
residential mortgage loans to private banking clients in the 
Netherlands and on other loans to healthcare and 
business professionals. The carbon footprint of these non-
residential mortgage loans is indicative, as it is estimated 
based on factors derived from data drawn from Statistics 
Netherlands (CBS). 
The reporting infrastructure for the carbon footprint of 
our AuM does not currently allow us to assign each 
individual holding's associated carbon footprint to one of 
the prescribed categories. This means that the carbon 
footprint of various mixed asset class strategies/solutions 
are categorised under "Other assets".
Carbon offsetting
We will continue to work on reducing our CO2e emissions 
in the coming years. Unfortunately, we will never be able 
to bring them down to zero; there will always be emissions 
left over, such as emissions from heating our offices or 
travelling to clients. Each year, we offset our remaining 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions related to our own 
operations. We offset the 2023 carbon footprint related 
to our own operations via reforestation and afforestation 
projects in Mexico, except for part of the emissions related 
to the use of company cars which are offset by one of our 
lease car companies on our behalf. 
In addition, we collaborate with a service provider that has 
planted 160,000 trees on our behalf in Portugal and 
Australia. Over the next 40 years, these trees will store 
around 43,000 tonnes CO2e. When the trees have grown 
big enough, we will utilise this project to offset the 
remainder of our own organisation's CO2e emissions.

Our environmental footprint
As a financial services provider, Van Lanschot Kempen has 
a direct environmental impact that is relatively limited. 
However, we have worked hard in recent years to reduce 
our environmental footprint.
Calculating our environmental footprint
Our footprint shows at a glance where our most material 
emissions occur, making it a useful guide when
drawing up carbon reduction measures. We began to 
calculate the footprint of our own operations in 2011 and 
the methodology that we use is in line with the 
international Greenhouse Gas Protocol.

9  The median in the calculation excludes Belgium, Switzerland and United Kingdom employees. The ratio reflects fixed pay – defined as full-time salary, holiday allowance, and the so-called 13th month payment. For specification of the highest-paid individual, see annual report, pages. 218-219
    (Remuneration of the Management and Supervisory Boards).
10 The number of days lost to sick leave (excluding maternity leave) as a percentage of the potentially available number of working days in a year.
11 86% of our employees are covered by collective labour agreements reached between the Works Council and Management Board. This only comprises employees in the Netherlands. The improvement in remuneration and working conditions in our other countries of operation is partially
     derived from these agreements, coupled with local conditions and developments. In addition, a proportion of our staff, mainly the management of the organisation, are employed under position-based contracts, which focus more on them achieving certain targets. The conditions of these
     contracts are also partially based on the agreements reached between the Works Council and Management Board.

17Due to uncertainty about the financial objective of the household loans collateralised by residential immovable property, we excluded €334 million in 2022 from our exposures to EU Taxonomy-eligible economic activities. This will therefore impact the GAR flow.

Reporting principles
Purpose
Our 2023 annual reporting which (in addition to this 
sustainability supplement) encompasses our annual report, 
tax transparency report, and GRI content index, is intended 
to inform our stakeholders on our financial and non-
financial policies and the associated efforts and results 
recorded in 2023. The reporting in this supplement 
provides more details, especially in relation to our financial 
and non-financial value creation.
Scope
Our reporting covers, as far as possible, the entire Van 
Lanschot Kempen organisation unless indicated otherwise, 
and is thereby generally in accordance with the list of 
entities as included in our annual report. A notable 
exception is the information related to the environmental 
footprint of our own operations, which is limited to the 
countries where we have significant operations: the 
Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom and 
Switzerland. Other countries not included in the 
environmental footprint are, in aggregate, not considered 
to be material. We generally consolidate information based 
on the full consolidation method (when we have 
management control of the subsidiary). 
Reporting period
Our reporting covers the period from 1 January 2023 up to 
and including 31 December 2023, while also including 
comparative information from the previous two years in 
order to provide a clearer picture of developments over 
time. Brief reference is made in a number of places to 
relevant developments following the closure of the 
reporting period; where this is the case, it is explicitly noted 
that the development in question occurred during the first 
months of 2024.
Reporting process
We have introduced an internal reporting manual that 
specifies (e.g. for our KPIs) what definitions are used, how 
the data for the report is collected, and what checks and 
balances should be conducted.
GRI
Van Lanschot Kempen has been following the guidelines of 
the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI, globalreporting.org) 
for its sustainability reporting since 2009. GRI is the 
international standard for transparent sustainability 
reporting. Our GRI content index showing how GRI has 
been incorporated in our 2023 annual report can be found 
on our website (vanlanschotkempen.com/en-nl/about-us/
sustainability/reporting-and-regulation). 
Stakeholder engagement
The dialogue with our stakeholders is the most important 
source of information on what our stakeholders expect 
from us. We identify five main stakeholder groups: clients, 
employees, shareholders and bondholders, governments/
regulators and business partners. Our annual report and 
sustainability supplement set out how we engaged our 
stakeholders in the reporting year, which topics 
stakeholders have raised with us and how we responded to 
them. Stakeholders with whom we engage are selected 
based on the stakeholder's link with the theme under 
discussion, stakeholder interest in participating in dialogue 
and pre-existing relationships. Our stakeholder 
engagement policy explains what our stakeholder 
engagement process looks like – see 
vanlanschotkempen.com/en-nl/about-us/sustainability/
governance-and-stakeholders. We warmly invite you to 
share your opinions and views with us – contact details can 
be found on the final page.
Materiality
Our 2023 annual report mainly contains information on our 
material topics. As material topics are relatively stable over 
time, their identification is carried out once every two 
years. The most recent identification of material topics for 
our stakeholders was carried out in the second quarter of 
2023 for the purpose of defining 2024 and 2025 targets 
and KPIs. Information on our latest materiality assessment 
is included in our annual report. Our reporting for 2023 is 
still based on our previous assessment, conducted in 2021, 
which is outlined in "Our 2021-23 materiality matrix" on 
page 5 above.
Choices made when reporting activities in the value chain 
Through our annual reporting we aim to provide all 
information that our key stakeholders require to make an 
informed assessment of our performance. As a wealth 
managers, our activities cover various parts of the financial 
sector value chain and have links to both asset owners 
(those who provide capital) and the real economy (generally 
companies that require capital to run and grow their 
business). In the process of allocating funds, we touch 
various groups of stakeholders, e.g. our employees and our 
shareholders.
We consider the information that is crucial for them to form 
their assessment to be "material". To understand which 
themes, topics and information they find important, we 
conduct a materiality assessment once every two years. We 
use materiality as the basic principle for further reporting 
our activities in the value chain. What this means in practice 
is that we chiefly report on topics that are material to our 
stakeholders, within our sphere of influence and within our 
own organisation. We do not generally report on chain 
issues or other topics that our stakeholders do not consider 
material, over which we have no direct influence, or which 
are otherwise situated outside Van Lanschot Kempen. In 
line with GRI, we have assessed – for each material topic 
externally reported – the so-called “boundaries” (see table 
on the next page). 
A boundary indicates:
1) Where the impact (most likely) occurs (inside or outside
      Van Lanschot Kempen), and 
2) What Van Lanschot Kempen's involvement with these
      impacts is. We may be involved because we 
      a) caused the impact;  
      b) contributed to the impact; or 
      c) are directly linked to the impact through business
           relationships.

l Causing l Causing We cause impacts within Van Lanschot Kempen when we manage our cost effectiveness 
(e.g. impact on employees due to reorganisations). Our cost management can also cause 
outside impacts, e.g. for clients, employees, shareholders and business partners.
Growth (2) Employees, 
shareholders, 
business partners
l Causing l Directly

Getting entrusted with the capital of our clients is the most fundamental proof of being a 
successful wealth manager. By growing our AuM, we create additional value for clients 
and as an organisation. By expanding our AuM, we also increase our indirect impact. 
Contribution to clients' wealth via 
investments (5)
Clients l Causing Although we enable a significant part of the impact internally (via our investment 
process), the impact itself occurs mainly outside our organisation, with our clients.
Quality of the workforce (6) Employees, clients l Causing l Causing Impact is caused inside Van Lanschot Kempen, as our HR policies are focused on our 
employees. In addition, there may be impact outside Van Lanschot Kempen, as the 
quality of our workforce can also impact our clients (e.g. via the service that our 
employees provide).
Diverse and inclusive workforce (8) Employees, clients l Causing l Causing Impact is caused inside Van Lanschot Kempen (via training and development) but can 
also move (via our employees) outside our organisation (clients).
Natural impact of our solutions (11) Clients, business 
partners
l Directly 
linked
We are directly linked to our client investments as we invest in companies, via our own 
funds and via external funds. Impacts can occur at investees, our clients and other 
stakeholders.
Client experience (13) Clients l Causing Although we cause an important proportion of the impact internally (via e.g. the creation 
of tools, systems and apps), the impact itself occurs mainly outside Van Lanschot 
Kempen (with clients).
Quality and relevance of solutions (14) Clients l Causing Although we cause an important proportion of the impact internally (via our employees 
and our solutions), the impact itself occurs mainly outside Van Lanschot Kempen (with 
clients).
Social impact of our solutions (15) Clients, business 
partners
l Directly

We are directly linked to our client investments as we invest in companies, via our own 
funds and via external funds. Impacts can occur at investees, our clients and other 
stakeholders.
Ethics and integrity (17) Clients, employees, 
shareholders, 
business partners
l Causing l Causing Potential impacts can be caused both within our organisation (by our employees) as well 
as outside our organisation (via the behaviour of our employees).
Compliance with laws and regulations (19) Clients, employees, 
shareholders, 
business partners
l Causing l Directly 
linked
Impact takes place inside Van Lanschot Kempen (license to operate) but can also move 
outside our organisation (clients, employees, shareholders, business partners).

Data collection process
The collection of data is a joint effort of several 
departments. For the KPI data collection process, the 
Finance, Reporting & Control department played a leading 
part, assisted by the Strategy, Sustainability & Corporate 
Development team, which had an advisory role, especially 
in relation to non-financial data. The Strategy, Sustainability 
& Corporate Development department played a leading 
role in gathering non-KPI data. To collect KPI data, we have 
used qualitative and quantitative surveys based on a variety 
of external guidelines endorsed by Van Lanschot Kempen 
and on internal policy principles. The surveys were sent to 
all relevant divisions and/or departments within the 
organisation. Some of the data are drawn from central 
management information systems and some from local 
sources. The Strategy, Sustainability & Corporate 
Development department performs a plausibility check and 
collates the data supplied.
Accuracy
Most of sustainability data we report is drawn from 
standard reporting systems and external sources. However, 
in some cases where such data was found to be lacking, we 
used assumptions or estimates. An illustrative example is 
that for some of our operations, mainly outside the 
Netherlands, we use assumptions to estimate the annual 
energy consumption and corresponding carbon footprint, 
for instance, because data on energy consumption for the 
full year is not available at the moment of reporting.
Carbon calculation for our own organisation
Carbon emissions were calculated and reported in line with 
the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, using the conversion factors 
set out by internationally recognised organisations and 
published on co2emissiefactoren.nl. We applied the 
following assumptions and estimates:
– Because no final annual accounts were available at the 
beginning of 2024 for Van Lanschot Kempen’s gas, 
electricity and water consumption for the full financial 
year 2023, these figures have partially been 
extrapolated.
– Diesel consumption when testing emergency systems 
within Van Lanschot Kempen in the Netherlands was 
estimated.
– Average fuel consumption of non-company cars for 
business travel is not known. We apply a generic 
emission factor for the GHG emissions resulting from 
car travel in the Netherlands.
– Several assumptions and estimates were used for all 
business travel using public transport when converting 
expense claims into kilometres travelled.
– Total transport in kilometres for the delivery of office 
supplies and catering relates solely to Van Lanschot 
Kempen’s activities in the Netherlands and is based in 
part on estimates.
There is very little likelihood that potential errors or 
inaccuracies in the estimates and assumptions referred to 
above would have a significant impact on the final results, 
given that the elements in question only account for a 
limited proportion of total calculated carbon emissions.
Carbon calculation for financed emissions
We estimate the carbon emissions associated with our 
balance sheet items, and assets under management, in 
accordance with the methodology of the Platform for 
Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF). We calculate 
emissions associated with mortgages using the latest 
known loan-to-value ratio compared with the loan-to-value 
ratio at origination. Deviating from the PCAF methodology, 
we only calculated carbon emissions for mortgages that had 
been on our books for at least three years. This was done to 
smooth out any short-term deviations in our portfolios.
Balance
To ensure that our own annual report is balanced, we report 
both positive and negative financial and non-financial 
performance. We capture the development of our 
performance by showing historic figures.
Clarity
We aim to present sustainability information that is in line 
with AFM Guidelines on Sustainability Claims. Our annual 
report describes the financial and non-financial impact of 
our organisation for our material topics. We provide 
additional information, especially on our value creation. We 
have also added a reference table in response to legislation 
on disclosure of non-financial information, to make it easier 
for our stakeholders to see how we comply. In addition, we 
include a GRI content index in which we state, for instance, 
our material topics and where to find relevant information.
Comparability
We publish an integrated annual report. This means that 
the most material financial and non-financial information is 
covered in our annual report; details of these topics and less 
material topics are discussed in our sustainability 
supplement and on our website. Our policy and objectives 
in terms of the social aspects of doing business have not 
changed from the previous reporting period. The definitions 
we use are still in line with our report for 2022 as far as 
possible, so that the data remains readily comparable. 
Where earlier definitions or figures have been adjusted in 
2023, this is expressly stated in the text or in the footnotes.
Verification
Earlier versions of the annual report were submitted for 
feedback to internal departments, the Management Board 
and the Supervisory Board. The final version has been 
approved by the Management and Supervisory Boards. 
Non-financial information included in the annual report, as 
well as the underlying data collection and data aggregation 
processes, have been reviewed by our independent 
external auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants 
NV (PwC). For more information on the scope of this 
verification, the activities performed by PwC and the 
results of these activities, see PwC’s assurance statement 
on page 263 of our 2023 annual report. The Management 
Board is closely involved in the verification process and 
related findings. The findings of the review are shared with 
the Management and Supervisory Board.

Reference table: Disclosure of Non-Financial Information Act
Decree on Disclosure of Non-financial Information (Besluit 
bekendmaking niet-financiële informatie)
In 2017, a Dutch regulation came into force that made 
reporting on a number of non-financial themes compulsory 
for companies that qualify as a large public interest entity 
(grote organisatie van openbaar belang) with more than 500 
employees. 
These themes comprise environmental, social and 
employee issues, as well as anti-corruption, bribery and 
human rights. For each of these themes, companies are 
obliged to report on the relevant policies, results, risks 
(including management of these risks), and non-financial 
key performance indicators. 
The regulation also requires companies to describe their 
business models in their annual reports.
The reference table shows where the required non-
financial information can be found and also whether this 
information relates to our material topics.
