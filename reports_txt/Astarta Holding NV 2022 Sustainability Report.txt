CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 
identified the key elements which contribute to soil health such as diversified crop rotation, 
reduced tillage, organic fertilisers and precision farming. 
Precision agriculture is closely related to continued development of the Company’s proprietary 
digital framework Agrichain. In 2022, despite the war, Agrichain launched development of two 
new modules: AgriChain Machinery - a system for management of machin ery and equipment 
and AgriChain Logistics - a unified system for planning and controlling transportation of all 
types of inputs and products by all modes of transport.   
Our aim is to upscale these practices in the years to come for the benefit of local communities 
of Ukraine and international customers world-wide. 
Sustainability of Astarta’s business is underpinned by the diversification of its product range, 
markets and growing self-sufficiency in the energy use. This would allow the Company to 
strengthen own energy independence and support the Ukrainian energy system which became 
the target of brutal missile attacks by Russia. 
Another area which draws our attention from a long -term strategic perspective is climate 
change. The post-war economic recovery of Ukraine will be closely aligned with EU policies such 
as Green Deal. We see our role, as a European public company with operations in Ukraine, in 
leading the decarbonisation agenda in close co -operation with local peers in each industry 
where we are present: primary agriculture, food processing and livestock.  
Every year since our first report under GRI standards for the year 2017, we have enhanced 
disclosure of key ESG metrics, including GHG emissions covering Scope 1, 2 and 3. Separately, 
Howard Dahl 
Chairman of the Board of Directors 
Last year brought unprecedented 
challenges to Ukraine and its society. 
No other country managed to keep its 
economy running amid a massive military 
assault. But the Ukrainian people and its 
businesses did. Astarta was one of tho se 
companies which continued operations, took 
care of the safety of its employees and family 
members, and managed to supply its 
agricultural products domestically and 
overseas. 
At Astarta we see our task in continuing 
business despite continued military 
aggression, and in the way which supports 
sustainable development of the Ukrainian 
state and society while integrating the 
country into the European markets and 
contributing to the global food security and 
climate change agenda. 
Last year Astarta was encoura ged by its 
international business partners to investigate 
regenerative agriculture which has become a 
key trend in global food and agriculture 
industry. As soon as spring crop planting was 
completed under new war-time conditions, 
we reviewed our agricultural practices and

we have contrib uted Astarta’s data to CDP, the global climate change platform covering 
18,500 corporations, from 2021. We have already started to disclose in accordance with TCFD 
which is becoming an international standard and plan further improvements on this. 
Last year we started cooperation with EY, a global consultancy firm, on developing a long -term 
climate corporate governance strategy based on the analysis of risks and opportunities 
presented by climate change, and the climate action plan tailored to our business m odel and 
technological solutions known to-date. We look forward publishing the key pillars of our climate 
change strategy for the attention of our stakeholders once the project is complete.

VALUE CREATION 
 
For people  
People are the most 
vulnerable and 
valuable capital of the 
business. The 
Company pays a lot of 
attention to the 
development of its 
employees, works hard 
towards retention of 
talent and adheres to a 
collaborative approach 
in relations with the 
workforce. In 2022 
Astarta employed 
6,591 people 93% of whom were 
employed in the rural area. Total 
contribution by the Company in the form of 
salary, wages and additional financial 
incentives was EUR57m in 2022. 
For shareholders and creditors  
Astarta proved to be a reliable and trusted 
partner for top local and international 
financial institutions enjoying stable access 
to financing sources. In 2022 Astarta paid 
EUR7m in loan interest. 
For local communities  
As a land operator, Astarta actively interacts 
with local communities which, among 
others, include landowners who lease out 
land to the Company. Astarta operates c. 
220k ha of land leased from almost 57k 
individual landowners. Payments under 
land lease li abilities totalled EUR2 7m in 
2022. 
Support of communities is a key focus for 
the Company which became of vital 
importance since the start of the russian 
aggression in Ukraine. In 2022 Astarta co -
founded a large -scale humanitarian project 
Common Help UA to help those who 
suffered from milita ry 
hostilities. As of the end 
of 2022 , estimated 
monetary value of 
donations and 
humanitarian supplies 
under Common Help UA 
project reached 
USD18m. 
For suppliers and 
clients  
The Company makes 
best efforts to improve 
its assets and produce 
high quality products to 
meet the highest requirements of clients. In 
2022 Astarta sold 226k t of sugar, 664k t 
of grains and oilseeds, 190k t of soybean 
products and 98k t of milk bringing 
EUR510m of total revenues. 
The Company deals with significant number 
of suppliers. In 2022 it procured from 17k 
suppliers with the total spend of EUR297m. 
For farmers  
Astarta closely cooperates with local 
farmers on supply of sugar beets to its 
sugar plants as well as to procuring grains 
and oilseeds for trading. In 2022 Astarta 
procured over 350kt of sugar beet and 
210kt of grains and oilseeds through the 
Partnership Centre. 
For the economy  
One of the key direct contributions to the 
Ukrainian economy is taxes paid by the 
Company. In 2022 Astarta paid UAH1.6bn 
(EUR48m) in taxes and duties in Ukraine 
including UAH629m (EUR19m) into the 
State budget of Ukraine and UAH972m 
(EUR31m) into the local budgets of the 
regions of Astarta’s presence.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 
 
INNOVATION AND R&D 
Today, innovation is the key tool for success 
and especially important under war conditions. 
The Ukrainian military is fighting with computer 
tablets in their hands, using modern 
technologies of warfare: troop management, 
logistics, communications, and specific military 
operations. This saves hundreds of thousands 
of lives - military and civilians. 
Similarly, the development of the agro-
industrial sector is impossible without modern 
IT technologies, which radically change how 
the business is done. Innovations are an 
important element of Astarta’s business model to ensure better operational results and 
enhance the sustainability aspect of its activities. The Company has a proprietary integrated 
multi-module IT software, called AgriChain, for agribusiness management. 
In 2022, despite the war, Agrichain contin ued upgrading existing modules and developing new 
ones, streamlining the complexity of agribusiness management practices. 
Among the new modules that the Agrichain started to develop are AgriChain Machinery 
(machinery and equipment management) and AgriChain  Logistics (logistics, inventory and 
product management). 
 
AgriChainMachinery - is a system for 
management of machinery and equipment 
which stores and accumulates telemetry 
data, integrates it with third- party systems, 
calculates the cultivated area and vehicle 
mileage  
AgriChain Logistics - is an integral system for 
planning and controlling transportation of all 
types of inputs and products by all modes of 
transport. The purpose of the module is to 
introduce a single automated system 
covering the entire "field -to-customer" route 
and raise efficiency through optimization, 
automation and regulation of logistics 
processes. 
 
 
 
The Company also worked on setting up an internal system based on artificial intelligence 
studying the data that had been accumulated for 30 years of business. The data is analysed 
using algorithms, and the results are used to guide management decisions in logistics. 


Page 11:

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 
 
A new feature aimed at automated soil sampling for further analysis in the laboratory was 
added to AgriChain Scout module. The soil sampling crew drives to a selected field under the 
app guidance to take samples from specific segments. 
AgriChain also started cooperation with the US “Planet Labs”, specialising in Earth observation 
from space. The application was in tegrated into AgriChain Scout to record condition of crops 
such as stage of vegetation and the quality of seedling with the help of satellites with a high-
resolution telescope. 
AgriChain also completed testing of the electronic management of transport cons ignment 
notes. The development of the system was led by the Ministry of Infrastructure of Ukraine to 
simplify and speed up logistics by replacing the paper transport consignment notes with 
electronic ones for transparency in freight transportation. 
KEY DEVELOPMENTS 
After the full scale russian aggression started in February 2022 the Company’s attention 
turned to the social aspect of sustainability.  Help to temporally displaced people who suffered 
from military hostilities became one of the top priorities in 2022.  
At the start of the war, Astarta co-founded a large-scale humanitarian project Common Help UA. 
The project grew through other businesses, international organizations, local communities and 
temporarily displaced civilians joining in to help those in need, nurture local entrepreneurship, 
create jobs for displaced people, support domestic 
producers and the economy as a whole. By the end of the 
2022, estimated monetary value of donations and 
humanitarian supplies to Common Help UA project reached 
USD18m. The project was involved in delivering 28kt of 
humanitarian supplies to circa 716k displaced civilians.  
Astarta continues to put every effort to maintain its development in key areas of the 
sustainability during war time.    
In 2022 Astarta continued development of the Climate Action Plan in partnership with the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and, at the beginning of 2023, finalised 
the analysis of climate change risks and opportunities, mitigation actions and relevant 
improvement in corporate governance practices. As a result, enhanced disclosure of GHG 
emissions and climate governance under TCFD recommendations was included in this report. 
Astarta also joined the project with Agreena - a soil carbon platform for farmers aimed at 
scaling regenerative agriculture practices through finance and technology. Agreena’s platform 
will be used to conduct assessment, monitoring and verification of greenhouse gas emission 
reductions resulting from change in farming practices on the assigned land area.  
The Company’s crop growing subsidiary called List-Ruchki had its status of an organic producer 
reconfirmed and successfully passed the certification by the Organic Standard and Bio Suisse. 
It also passed the inspection for the European/Danube soy certification. 
During the UN Global Compact Leaders’ Summit in New York Mr. Viktor Ivanchyk, Astarta’s 
CEO, representing Ukraine, was named a 2022 SDG Pioneer for Sustainable Business Strategy 
for achievements in promoting the Sustainable Development Goals.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 
 
In 2022 Forbes Ukraine ranked Astarta among 15 the most resilient Ukrainian companies. The 
ranking was prepared based on assessment of resilience of Ukrainian businesses under the 
war-time conditions. 
Astarta won the All -Ukrainian HR -Brand

ORGANISATIONAL AND CONTENT RELATED REPORTING 
BOUNDARIES  
The information presented in this report includes data as of the end of fiscal year ending 31 
December 2022 in comparison with 2021 and is applied to ASTARTA HOLDING PLC with its 
subsidiaries and associates. Astarta evaluated the importance and applicability of key

Throughout the year interviews were conducted by key executives from each business segment 
with the respective group of stakeholders to compile a list of material topics. Management 
board anonymously conducts ranking of these topics on a scale of 1 -10, where 10 was scored 
as the most important issue, and 0 —  a question of minimal importance. Based on ranking, the 
materiality matrix was prepared, pointing out the as pects that Astarta and its stakeholders 
consider to be material for its business activity. 
In 2022 the Company reviewed the list of the material topics and grouped the questions under 
respective ESG topic. As a result, the following topics were evaluated for further assessment of 
their  materiality: Ecological –  energy consumption, waste management, water consumption, 
certification and sustainable products, responding to climate change, emissions, animal 
welfare, land use and biodiversity, responsible procurement; Social –  cooperation with local 
communities, human capital, human rights, diversity, occupational safety, russian invasion 
impact; Governance – Board management structure, business ethics.

TASK FORCE ON CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES 
Although TCFD recommendations remain voluntary they are recognised as a reliable guidance 
for reporting of climate-related information and are embedded into the EU legislation. 
The statements in this section, which Asta rta believes are consistent with disclosure 
recommendations of TCFD, provides analysis of the risks and opportunities arising from 
climate change, their impact on the company’s business and possible actions to mitigate those 
risks. Additional information o n climate-related issues including disclosure on GHG emissions 
is also disclosed with this Report.  
Governance  
The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the climate -related issues. With this 
purpose the Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility (SCR) Committee was established in 
2020 and consists of members of the Board. It assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its 
responsibility for oversight of relevant sustainability and corporate social responsibility policies, 
strategy and development projects of the Company. 
There is also an Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) committee at the executive 
management level which is responsible for implementing sustainability strategy. The ESG 
committee consists of the key members of executive management including the CFO, heads of 
upstream and downstream operations and is chaired by the CEO. The committee sets and 
reviews key ESG performance indicators together with other issues including risks, strategy and 
implementation of sustainability projects by the Company. 
Sustainability issues are also considered by the Investment Committee when reviewing new 
development projects to identify potential risks, benefits and overall ESG-related impact. 
From 2021 the Director for Sustainable Business Development and Investor Relations leads 
the sustainability function on behalf of the executive management board. The scope of 
responsibilities covers sustainability strategy, monitoring of implementation of sustainable 
practices, overseeing compliance with local and international standards and requirements in 
the sphere of sustainable development, as well as reporting to stakeholders. 
The Director for Sustainable Business Development and Investor Relations prepares a 
dedicated presenta tion on key sustainability matters including climate -related issues for 
consideration by the ESG committee and the SCR Committee on a quarterly basis. The 
Company’s Audit Committee also reviews and discusses the Annual Report which, among other 
topics, includes the sustainability section. 
Astarta was assisted by its advisor, EY, under the project Climate Corporate Governance 
Improvement and Climate Action Plan EY and conducted a comprehensive analysis of current 
climate corporate governance framework. As a result, several key areas, namely: the board’s 
oversight of climate related risks and responsibilities and management’s role in assessing and 
managing climate -related risks and opportunities were identified as those that can be 
potentially improved through:

incentives for the Board 
1. Enhancement of the process by which 
Management is informed about 
climate related issues  
2. Clear definition of climate roles and 
responsibilities in senior managerial 
positions and those forming the ESG 
committee  
3. Cascade down climate oversight 
functions from the Board’s SCR 
Committee to the ESG committee of 
executive management  
4. Update the current system of KPI and 
related incentives with KPIs and 
incentives tied to climate related 
targets  
In 2023 Astarta plans to review its corporate governance framework to implement the 
recommendations. 
Strategy and risk management  
Within the Climate Action Plan Astarta, together with EY, conducted a comprehensive analysis 
of climate-related risks, opportunities and financial impacts based on TCFD recommendations. 
The climate-related risks were grouped into two groups, accordingly: physical and transition.  
Physical risks and opportunities 
According to TCFD physical risks are the risks that emanate from climate change and relate to 
event-driven (acute) risk such as increased severity of extreme weather events (e.g., cyclones, 
droughts, floods, and fires) as well as to longer-term shifts (chronic) in precipitation and 
temperature and increased variability in weather patterns (e.g., sea level rise). While a 
potential positive impact can arise from efforts undertaken to mitigate and adapt to climat e 
change. 
Analysis of physical risks and opportunities under the 1.5ºС and >3ºС temperature scenarios 
was performed using t he Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios: Scenario 1 - 
RCP 1.9 (1.5°C equivalent) and Scenario 2 - RCP 8.5 (> 3°C equivalent).  
To estimate the importance of the risks and opportunities for the Company a dedicated scoring 
matrix of prioritisation of risks and opportunities  was developed. The scoring approach 
considers the following parameters: 
Likelihood: indicates the probability of the risk and opportunity materialising over the projection 
horizon; 

Page 20:
 
20 
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 
 
Likelihood  Description  
High Risk/ opportunity is highly likely to occur with high frequencies of recurrence 
Medium Risk/ opportunity is occasional in nature with moderate frequency of recurrence 
Low Risk/ opportunity is less likely to occur with low frequency of recurrence 
Impact: indicates the severity and duration of financial /operational impact, should the risk and 
opportunity materialise. 
Impact  Description  
Strongly positive Opportunity is expected to create high monetary benefits for business/ 
operations and persist for a long duration 
Positive Opportunity is expected to create moderate monetary  
benefits for business/ operations and persist for long to medium duration 
Neutral  Risk/opportunity is expected to have minimal positive/negative impact on 
business/ operations and persist for medium to short duration 
Negative Risk is expected to have moderate financial impact on 
business/operations and persist for long to medium duration 
Strongly negative Risk is expected to have high financial impact on business/ operations 
and persists for a long duration 
Based on the level of likelihood and impact a score from 0 (a risk with the low level of 
likelihood and neutral impact) to -12 (a risk with the high level of likelihood and strongly 
negative impact) was assigned to each risk identified. A score from 0 (an opportunity with the 
low level of likelihood and neutral impact) to 12 (an opportunity with the high level of likelihood 
and strongly positive impact) was assigned to each opportunity identified. 
The physical risks analysis covers a projection horizon from 2020 to 2050 and focuses on the 
most significant (by the size of leased farmland) regions of Astarta`s operations in the Centre 
and West of Ukraine as well as key business segments of the Company. 
Physical risks and opportunities identified and analysed are presented in the tables below.

The matrix ranks prioritization of the physical risks and opportunities based on the level of 
likelihood and impact under two pathways: 1.5°C equivalent pathway (Scenario RCP 1.9) and 
>3°C equivalent pathway (Scenario 2 - RCP 8.5). Most of the physical risks are concentrated in 
the middle left area –  risks with low level of likelihood and neutral or negative impact which 
suggest a low level of overall influence on the Company. At the same time risks in the bottom 
right area are the risks related to acute events such as drought and heat wave resulting in 
episodic decrease in production efficiency, crops and milk yields. Such risks require particular 
attention and implementation of measures by the Company’s management to reduce possible 
impact. The potential adaptation measures for material risks R1 –  R4 are indicated in the 
tables on the pages 21-24.

At the same time both pathways lead to opportunities arising from expected gradual increase 
in mean temperature, annual precipitation levels and decrease in the number of frost nights in 
Ukraine resulting in higher yields in the long run. 
Transition risks and opportunities  
According to TCFD transition risks are the risks that show non -physical potential impacts of 
climate change on the organization and can be associated with the transition to a lower -carbon 
global economy, the most common of which relate to policy and legal actions, technology 
changes, market responses, and reputational considerations. 
Analysis of transitional risks and op portunities was performed based on the scenarios 
developed by International Energy Agency (IEA); Network for Greening the Financial System 
(NGFS); Principles for Responsible Investment network (PRI). The following scenarios were 
chosen to identify and analyse risks and opportunities under the 1.5ºС and >3ºС pathways: 
Scenarios under 1.5ºС pathway:  IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050, NGFS Net Zero 2050, PRI 
IPR 1.5°C Required Policy Scenario, which mostly correspond to each other. 
Scenarios under >3ºС pathway:  IEA Stated Policies, NGFS Current Policies Scenario, which 
mostly correspond to each other.

1.5°C pathway  
The 1.5°C pathwa y, assumes implementation of strict climate policy and legislative 
requirements, technology, and innovation, leading to significant risks and opportunities. 
Several risks are assessed to have a neutral impact despite medium to high likelihood. The 
remaining risks are expected to have negative and strongly negative impact with medium to 
high likelihood, to which the Company needs to pay special attention. Six out of eight transition 
climate opportunities are assessed to have a positive and strongly positive impact on Astarta, 
and two of them - neutral. The likelihood of all opportunities vary from medium to high. 
Opportunities with the highest impact and likelihood can help improve business processes, find 
new consumers and markets and, eventually lead to a p ositive effect on operational activities 
and/or profitability.

>3ºС pathway  
Scenarios within this pathway consider all existing and announced policy and legislative 
changes related to climate change as of 2022. There are no additional regulatory requirements 
for this scenario. However, an increase in the average temperature globally is projected at 
>3ºC. This will bring significant physical climate risks. Accordingly, transition climate risks will 
be significantly lower compared to the 1.5°C scenario. 
The impact of ten out of eleven transition climate risks on Astarta have mainly negative impact 
with likelihood from low to high which requires special attention from the management of the 
Company. A tangible positive impact is observed in three out of five opportunities with low and 
medium likelihood. The rest of the opportunities suggest neutral impact. 
Climate-related risks identification and assessment is part of the general approach to principal 
risk management. For more information on risk management ple ase refer to the Risk 
Management section of this report. 
EU TAXONOMY DISCLOSURE 
According to the EU Taxonomy regulation an undertaking which is under obligation to publish 
non-financial information pursuant to Article 19a or Article 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU shall 
include in its annual report information on how and to what extent th e undertaking’s activities 
are associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable. The report 
needs to single out the proportion of business activities that are considered as eligible and 
aligned with the Taxonomy in their turnover, capital expenditure and operational expenditure. 
To identify eligible and aligned activities Astarta conducted screening of its activities with 
respect to their eligibility and alignment with the Taxonomy. As a result, the Company has not 
identified any activities that meet the scope of the Taxonomy. 
Therefore, 100% of the Company’s revenues (EUR510m), capital expenditures (EUR17m) and 
operational expenditure (EUR4.4m) were derived from non -eligible activities. As a result, the 
Company has no activities aligned with the Taxonomy. 
For this disclosure:  
• Total revenues – revenues from external customers; 
• Capital expenditure - additions to tangible and intangible assets considered before 
depreciation, amortisation and re -measurements, including those resulting from 
revaluations, impairments, excluding fair value changes, and additions to tangible and 
intangible assets resulting from business combinations; 
• Operational expenditure - R&D costs, building renovation costs, short term leases, 
maintenance and repair costs, all other direct costs necessary to operate the asset. 
At the same time Astarta has activities which it believes to be environmentally sustainable. 
Among these activities are:  
1. Anaerobic digestion of organic material with the resulting produ ction of biogas. The 
Company operates a biogas facility which uses sugar beet pulp, a by -product of sugar 
beet processing, for production of biogas. The biogas is supplied to other production 
subsidiaries of the Company. Therefore, the revenues from this s upply are recognised 
as intercompany revenues;  
2. Organic farming. The organic farming methods utilised by Astarta improve soil health 
and contribute to removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. One of the Company’s 

Page 40:

subsidiaries obtained the status of an organic p roducer and uses 1.8kha of farmland 
for its operations. In 2022 revenues from sale of organic produce to external 
customers were EUR2.1m. 
RUSSIAN INVASION IMPACT 
The war created extremely difficult challenges for Ukraine which one could hardly imagine in 
the 21st century. Millions of Ukrainians had lost their security, housing, workplaces and some -  
their relatives and friends. Persistent military strikes on cities and towns by russian missiles, 
shelling and mining of vast areas is a colossal tragedy for pe ople and a massive environmental 
disaster. 
Ukrainian businesses also faced unprecedented challenges. According to International Rescue 
Committee (IRC) 90% of enterprises suffered from reduced demand and 71% faced difficulties 
due to disruptions in supply c hains. There is no sector in Ukraine that was not affected, as the 
war brought challenges to production processes, transportation of goods including for exports, 
human capital, etc. On top of that Ukraine is now among the world's most mine -contaminated 
countries which will be a significant issue for the next decades. 
Many businesses suffered physical damage to their assets including those from the agricultural 
sector. The most significant damage was done to farms in close proximity to military hostilities. 
According to IRC 25% of small farmers stopped or reduced agricultural production due to the 
war, while rising costs of production were felt across the country. According to the Ministry of 
Agriculture the total direct and indirect damage to the agriculture sector was estimated at 
USD41bn, adding to the Ukrainian economy contraction. 
In 2022 according to the National Bank of Ukraine 
the domestic economy contracted by 30%, 
inflation rose to 27%, unemployment reached 26% 
eroding livelihoods across the country. Persistent 
military shelling led to a huge number of casualties 
at the scale of humanitarian catastrophe. This lead 
to the Ukrainian population movement to the tune 
of 7.8m refugees across Europe –  the largest 
displacement crisis in decades. In 2022 the UN 
Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner 
(OHCHR) recorded 17,994 civilian casualties of 
which 6,919 people were killed, including 429 
children. The OHCHR believed that the actual 
figures were considerably higher, as information from some locations where intense hostilities 
had been ongoing was delayed and many reports were still pending corroboration. 
Along with unimaginable social impact the Ukrainian environment also suffered from military 
hostilities. As of the end of 2022, according to the Ministry of Environmental Protection and 
Natural Resources of Ukraine, the total damage to the environment was estimated at more 
than EUR50bn, including:  
• Air pollution. Around  33mt of CO 2 eq. were emitted in 2022 due to military hostilities, 
movement of internally displaced people and fires. It was also estimated that 49mt of 
CO2 eq. would be emitted in the process of the post-war recovery and reconstruction.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 
• Forest destruction. Along with CO 2 emissions Ukraine suffered from significant damage 
to forests with over 340kha of woods damaged by fires and cut down to build tranches. 
• Groundwater and soil contamination. The war caused severe damage to the farmland 
and water resources as the soil and water reservoirs in military hostilities areas were 
polluted by chemicals and fuels from exploded rockets and artillery shells. Additionally, 
significant land area was damaged during the construction of defence lines leading to 
degradation of vegetation, wind and water erosion. 
• Habitat destruction. As a result of russian invasion around one third of the biodiversity 
was affected and 200 areas of the Emerald Network appeared to be close to extinction. 
The total war impact is hard to estimate as the destruction continues daily. But it became clear 
that consequences of the war brought by russia to Ukraine are felt all around the world. 
Impact on Astarta  
From the beginning of the full-scale war the Company’s top priority was health and safety of its 
employees and their families, as well as continuity of operations under the warfare conditions. 
Office-based personnel worked remotely from home and shelters while production -based 
employees performed their duties when it was safe to do so. Many employees had to relocate 
from homes to other Ukrainian regions, as well as send their families abroad. Some workers 
had been called into the military service and their colleagues were filling the gaps in the 
workplace. 
To support its employees the Company introduced special programme covering physical safety 
of employees, financial and psychological support, including for those drafted into the Armed 
Forces and their families. Over 300 of Astarta’s employees joined the army and 1 6 employees 
were killed in combat as of the date of this report. The Company provided aid to families of 
those who gave their lives for the country’s independence. 
In 2022 more than 300 employees were provided financial and non -financial assistance under 
such programme. War -related additional financial payments to employees totalled EUR0.15m 
on top of EUR1.6m of regular wages that the Company continued to pay to the employees who 
had been called to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. 
Astarta did not suffer material impact from physical damage of assets during the war with an 
exception of c.4kha under Astarta’s management in the Chernihiv region that were under 
temporary occupation until the beginning of April 2022. Later in the same month the land was 
cleared of mines, unexploded shells, and sizeable metal fragments. The land did not require 
massive reclamation and the Company returned to farming operations there. 
In May 2022 one of Astarta’s employ ees - a 
civilian tractor driver working in the field - 
died from missile fired at the vehicle from a 
russian military aircraft away from the 
battlefield. 
As a result of the mentioned russian military 
aircraft attack the tractor was destroyed. The 
estimated value of the machinery was  
EUR0.1m.  
During 2022 the Company provided 133 
units of motor transport of different types for 
A guided missile fired from a russian plane hit Astarta’s tractor 
working in the field 

Page 42:
 
42 
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 
the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with the total estimated value of EUR0.5m. 
The Company was also forced to reconsider its logistics modality. Before the full-scale war, 
Astarta’s entire agricultural produce was exported by sea. Due to the blockade of seaports in 
March-July 2022, coupled with insufficient capacity of the European railway infrastructure and 
inspection delays in the operations of the Odessa-based grain corridor by russian inspectors, 
Astarta explored alternative overland export routes. This, together with increased prices for 
overland logistics, led to growth of S&D expenses from 6% of revenues in 2021 to 13% of 
revenues in 2022. 
Due to high risks at the beginning of the war the operation of the soybean crushing plant was 
suspended for two  weeks. In mid -March 2022 the Globynsky Processing Plant resumed 
operations and reached planned production capac ity (for more information please refer to the 
Soybean Processing section of the Astarta’s Annual Report 2022). 
Due to t he constant power outages caused by the russian missile attacks the Company 
purchased electricity generators to secure continuity of production processes. The cost of 
generators purchased in 2022 was EUR0.3m. 
Since the start of the war domestic government institutions and businesses faced constant 
cyber-attacks from russia. Well organized technical infrastructure and professional team of 
Astarta’s IT Department and proprietary IT software AgriChain successfully repelled these 
attacks. There was no damage to the IT systems of the Company recorded. 
In 2022 direct charitable and social contribution of the Company totalled EUR3.5m. Total 
contribution from a dedicated humanitarian project set up by Astarta in collaboration with other 
parties reached USD18m. Astarta co-founded a large-scale humanitarian project Common Help 
UA in March 2022. The project grew through membership of other businesses, international 
organizations, local communities which united to help people in need, nurture local 
entrepreneurship, create jobs for internally displaced people, support domestic producers and 
the economy as a whole. By the end of 2022, Astarta provided 28kt of humanitarian supplies, 
including 39k of food rations, to c. 716k internally displaced civilians.

ENVIROMENTAL 
Energy 
GRI-302; SDG-12 
The nature of Astarta’s business implies use of different energy resources like natural gas 
which is mainly used by the Sugar Production and Soybean Processing segments and liquid 
fuels mostly consumed in the Agriculture segment. 
In 2022 key production sites in the Sugar Productions and Soybean Processing successfully 
confirmed certification according to the international standard ISO 50001 “Energy 
management”. 
Sugar production is one of the most energy intensive processes in the food  industry. Overall 
energy consumption in the Sugar Production decreased by 10% to 2,077kGJ due to lower 
production volumes. The natural gas consumption declined by 22% y-o-y to 38.6mm 3 and 
biogas consumption increased 6x y -o-y to 7.4mm 3. The share of the Sugar Production in the 
total energy consumption was 62%. 
The Agriculture segment is the main consumer of diesel used by agricultural machinery. In 
2022 diesel consumption per ha reduced by 10% y-o-y to 64kg/ha as some field operations 
were completed i n 2023 whereas in 2021 these filed operations were performed before the 
year end. Overall energy consumption in the Agriculture reduced by 16% to 871kGJ 
representing a 26% share in total energy consumption. 
Energy consumption in the Soybean Processing incr eased by 22% y -o-y to 270kGJ due to 
higher soybean processing volumes in 2022. Biogas consumption in the Soybean processing 
segment increased 7x y -o-y to 6.2mm 3 replacing the natural gas consumption needs by up to 
50% (or 3.5mm3). The share of the segment in the total energy consumption was 8%. 
The Cattle Farming energy consumption increased by 2% y -o-y to 117kGJ due to the growth in 
diesel consumption by 10% y-o-y to 1.7kt used for generators during blackouts. 
Responding to climate change Astarta seeks way s to reduce its negative impact through the 
use of sustainable energy sources like granulated beet pulp and biogas produced by an in -
house bioenergy facility which allows to partially replace natural gas at several production sites. 
Total energy consumption from renewable energy sources more than doubled y -o-y to 346kGJ 
representing 10% of the Company’s total energy balance. 
Astarta further enhanced the methodology of energy calculation by switching to use of the main 
source of specific indicators for the calculation of energy consumption is Ukraine’s Greenhouse 
Gas Inventory 1990 -2020 (Annual National Inventory Report for Submission under the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol, Kyiv 2022) and 
internal technical documentation. 
Based on the new calculation methodology the company restated energy consumption for the 
previous reporting period. The updated data is presented below.

Water and Effluents 
GRI-303; SDG-6 
Water is the most widespread resource on the planet but only 2.5% of reserves is suitable for 
human consumption. According to FAO agriculture is the largest water user, accounting for 70% 
of total freshwater withdrawals. Ukraine is among the countries with insufficient access to 
freshwater resources which is especially noticeable in its southern regions in need for 
irrigation. 
Astarta’s business operations are in the central and western re gions with higher levels of 
precipitation and availability of water resources. According to the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas 
the Company withdraws water in high, medium -high, and low-medium areas of water risk. Yet, 
responsible consumption of water is among key priorities for the Company. 
Astarta withdraws fresh water from surface and underground sources according to limits and 
permits from local authorities. 

Page 45:
 
45 
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 
In the Agriculture segment water is mainly used in irrigation and application of plant protection 
products, and general household needs. The discharged water is mainly wastewater collected 
in special reservoirs for further discharging and treatment by specialist organisations. 
In the Sugar Production water is used for washing sugar beets and for cooling power stations at 
sugar mills. Sugar plants have different categories of water used in sugar beet processing. The 
First category of water is technical water from a water reservoir, the Second category of water 
is clean water used for sugar beets washing and their transportation along the conveyor belt. 
The Third category of water is wastewater that contains sludge from the technological process. 
The latter category of water is not returned to the production cycle but discharged to the 
absorption fields next to the sugar plants for natural biological treatment of wastewater. 
The Soybean Processing segment withdraws relatively small amount of water for processing 
operations. Like in sugar operations wastewater is discharged to the absorption fields. 
Cattle Farming operations withdraw water mainly for watering the animals and washing milking 
equipment. The wastewater is discharged to special reservoirs for further discharging and 
treatment by specialist organisations. 
To control the quality of intake water an d discharged wastewater Astarta performs a 
specialized analysis under internal annual monitoring plan. 
The Company initiated development of automated system for data collection for water and 
effluents. Thus, the data on water withdrawal, discharge and cons umption will be presented 
after implementation of this system. 
Land Use and Biodiversity 
GRI-304; SDG-15 
Since the full scale russian invasion Ukrainian environment suffered significant damage 
caused by the military hostilities. As of the end of 2022 according to the Ministry of Ecology the 
total damage to the environment is estimated at UAH1.7 trillion (EUR50 billion). It includes 
damage from air pollution from burning of oil products; forests devasted by fires and cut down 
to build tranches; groundwater and soil got contaminated with heavy metals and toxic 
chemicals; wildlife killed or pushed out of their habitats etc. 
According to national experts Ukraine is home to more than 70k animals and plants species 
which represents 35% of the estimated European biodiversity. As a result of russian invasion 
around one third of the biodiversity was affected and 200 areas of the Emerald Network 
appeared to be close to extinction. 
The war also caused severe damage to the farmland which is a key asset for agriculture se ctor 
in Ukraine. The land around military hostilities was polluted by chemicals and fuels from 
exploded rockets and artillery shells affecting the local ecosystem. 
By way of example, below are the satellite images of the same field in the Kharkiv oblast 
published by the Ukrainian Nature Conversion Group (UNGC).

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 
  
According to UNGC there are 480 craters from 82 -millimeter shells, 547 craters from 120 -
millimeter shells, and 1,025 craters from 152 -millimeter shells on this image. As a result, 
around 50 tonnes of iron, 1 tonne of sulphur compounds, and 2.4 tonnes of co pper was 
released into the soil within one square kilometre. 
Land under management of Astarta was not heavily affected except for c.4kha in the Chernihiv 
region which were under temporary occupation until the beginning of April 2022. The latter 
were cleared from mines, unexploded shells, and sizeable metal fragments. Considering that 
the land was not significantly affected and did not require reclamation  Astarta returned to 
farming operations there. At the same time nearby forests are still not cleared of m ines, 
unexploded shells, metal fragments and chemicals. 
Understanding the importance of preserving the biodiversity and land resources in farming 
operations Astarta is engaged in regenerative practices and aims to further tilt its farming 
practices towards higher positive impact on biodiversity and land. One of the key elements of 
regenerative farming is reduced tillage approach as the depth of tillage is linked to the soil 
degradation and change in biodiversity. In 2022 the Company applied reduced tillage to 
106kha. 
Another important element of regenerative farming is use of cover crops and reduction in use 
of synthetic fertilizers by applying nitrification inhibitors and organic fertilizers. These protects 
soil from erosion, therefore improving its health. In 2022 Astarta used cover crops, nitrification 
inhibitors and organic fertilizers on the area of 11kha. 
Astarta actively uses digital solutions for land management such as proprietary IT software 
called AgriChain developed by its in-house agritech subsid iary. The AgriChain Land module 
allows to monitor and control location of land plots operated by the Company in relation to the 
nature reserve areas. Astarta can make a fast verification whether a land plot which is 
considered for potential lease belongs to such areas. 
There are also other elements of digitalisation and precision farming employed such as 
differentiated sowing, fertilisers and crop protection application to improve productivity while 
mitigating negative impact on soil. 
Raw materials such as soybeans and sugar beets supplied to the Company’s processing plants 
are grown in-house or by local farmers. Neither Astarta’s agricultural subsidiaries engaged in 
crop and milk production, nor local farmers use any deforested land or involved in any kind of 
deforestation activities. 
Astarta’s approach to land use and biodiversity is based on the corresponding policies and 
standards developed according to national and international requirements.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 
Astarta implemented the following key standards, policies and procedures in the sphere of land 
use and biodiversity: the Sustainability Policy, the Environmental Policy, the Sustainable 
Agriculture Policy, the Deforestation Policy, the Biodiversity Corporate Standard. 
Based on the above-mentioned documents management of the Company is committed to: 
• assesses the potential effects, cumulative, direct and indirect impacts of any new or 
reconstruction project on biodiversity; 
• use the components of biological diversity in such a way and at a speed that does not 
lead to its long-term reduction  
• abide by the principle of avoiding the impact on biodiversity and minimization of 
potential impact; 
• keep the Company’s operating activities out of protected areas, such as nature 
reserves; 
• introduce modern regenerative farming practices; 
• use species that are naturally adapted to local and regional ecosystem for higher 
resistance to pests and diseases; 
• implement best practices for sustainable management. 
Emissions and Responding to Climate Change 
GRI-305; SDG-3, SDG-12, SDG-13, SDG-15 
GHG and other emissions  
Among emissions generated by Astarta’s business activities are greenhouse gas emissions: 
carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2O), and other emissions such as 
particulate matters (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOX), sulfur dioxide and compounds (SOX). 
The Company performs annual environmental monitoring under national law to control: 
• air emissions from stationary, mobile sources, and at the borders of the sanitary 
protection zones; 
• efficiency of dust and gas capture; 
Under the project Climate Action Plan Astarta updated its inventory of GHG emissions sources 
for all business segments following GHG Protocol Standards, IPCC Guidelines and Ukraine’s 
Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990 -2020. As a result, the Company enha nced disclosure of 
Scope 1, 2, 3 and added disclosure on biogenic emissions to this report. The global warming 
potential used in the calculations is based on the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report, 2022 (AR6). 
GHG emissions from land management, wastewater, an d refrigerants were added to the 2022 
and 2021 Scope 1 emissions resulting in restatement of Scope 1 emissions for 2021. 
Scope 1 emissions  
Under an updated methodology, the Agriculture is the biggest emitter of direct GHG emissions 
(Scope 1) with 54% share of total. In 2022 the segment generated 261kt of CO 2eq (down by 
15% y-o-y) with the most significant share of emissions coming from land management (78% of 
total). GHG emissions from land management decreased by 15% y -o-y to 204kt of CO2eq due to 
lower amount of nitrogen applied to soil. 
Direct GHG emissions in the Sugar Production (27% share in total Scope 1 emissions) 
decreased by 26% y-o-y to 128kt of CO2eq due to lower production volumes.  

Page 48:
 
48 
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 
Direct GHG emissions from the Soybean Processing operations increased by 20% y -o-y to 13kt 
of CO2eq due to the increase in soybeans crushing volumes by 23%. Share in the total Scope 1 
emissions was 3%. 
Scope 1 emissions in Cattle Farming (stationary and mobile sources, manure management, 
enteric fermentation, refrigerants, and wastewater) were calculated according to Tier 2 
approach of IPPC Guidelines. Total direct emissions grew by 7% y -o-y to 74kt of CO2eq due to 
the increase of average annual herd. Share in the total Scope 1 emissions was 16%. 
Direct GHG emissions from the biogas production and head office are insignificant with 1% 
share in total Scope 1 emissions. 
Total Scope 1 emissions amounted 480kt of CO 2eq, (down by 14% y -o-y) representing 63% 
within the scopes. 
Scope 2 emissions 
Scope 2 emissions are derived from consumption of purchased electricity. 
The Agriculture segment consumes purchased electricity mainly during the process of cleaning 
and drying grains and oilseeds. In 2022 the segment emissions were reduced by 28% y-o-y to 
4kt of CO2eq or 28% of total Scope 2 emissions, due to the lower volumes of grain and oilseeds 
handling. 
The Sugar Production segment uses electricity mainly during the plant maintenance period. Its 
share in total Scope 2 emissions is 17% or 3kt of CO 2eq, down by 14% y -o-y reflecting lower 
volume of maintenance works. 
The Soybean Processing segment was the biggest consumer of purchased electricity and 
emitted 4kt of CO2eq (up by 9%) or 28% of total Scope 2 emissions. 
The Cattle Farming consumes purchased electricity to ensure the operation of refrigeration and 
milking equipment. Share in total Scope 2 emissions was 24% or 4kt of CO2eq in 2022. 
Total Scope 2 emissions amounted to 15kt of CO2eq (down by 8% y-o-y) with 2% within scopes. 
Scope 2 emissions calculation is based on the CO 2e grid emissions factors from the 
Harmonized IFI Default Grid Factors 2021 v3.1. 
Scope 3 emissions 
In 2022 the Company calculated downstream and upstream emissions under GHG Protocol 
Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. Scope 3 emissions 
calculation was performed following CO 2eq emission factors of GHG Protocol “Scope 3 
Evaluator”, Department for Environment, Food and  Rural Affairs of UK, UK and England's 
carbon footprint to 2019, and United States Env ironmental Protection Agency, GHG Emission 
Factors Hub. 
According to GHG protocol Scope 3 emissions are divided into 15 distinct reporting categories. 
The Company evaluated all 15 categories and identified the following most applicable 
categories of Scope 3 emissions:  
-  Category 1 emissions from purchased goods and services are the most significant in the total 
Scope 3 emissions with 40% share or 109kt of CO2eq (up by 3% y-o-y). 

Page 49:
 
49 
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 
- Category 3 emissions from fuel- and energy-related emissions decreased 16% y-o-y to 41kt of 
CO2eq due to lower fuel and electricity consumption. The category share in the total Scope 3 
emissions was 15%. 
- Category 4 emissions from upstream transportation and distribution increased by 30% to 
21kt of CO 2eq due to longer delivery distances of input materials or 7% from the total Scope 3 
emissions. 
- Category 9 emissions from downstream transportation and distribution represent 25% share 
in the total Scope 3 emissions. In 2022 emissions in this category increased 3.5x t o 67kt of 
CO2eq due to the change in products delivery terms towards longer delivery distances.  
Total Scope 3 emissions increased by 21% y -o-y to 271kt of CO2eq. corresponding to 35% share 
in total direct and indirect emissions. 
Biogenic emissions  
Biogenic CO2 emissions are defined as emissions from biological sources or materials derived 
from biological matter. Biogenic material is a material derived from biomass, which includes 
organic material (both living and dead), e.g. trees, crops, grasses, tree li tter, algae, animals, 
manure and waste of biological origin. All sources of biogenic emissions are associated with 
carbon of biomass origin, which has been previously accumulated from atmosphere during 
biomass growth period. This defines separate approach for accounting of GHGs emissions 
compared to other anthropogenic emissions. 
In 2022 the Company calculated biogenic emissions for the first time. For comparison purpose 
Astarta also calculated biogenic emissions for 2021. The main sources of the Company’s 
biogenic emissions are soil organic carbon loss, biogas, and biomass combustion (dry 
granulated beet pulp and woodfire). 
Emissions from soil carbon loss increased by 27% to 286kt of CO 2eq (92% share of total 
biogenic emissions) due to 41% lower amount of n itrogen application to the soil in 2022 at 
13kt. Lower nitrogen application rate leads to a rise in the share of carbon losses from soil. 
6x increase in biogenic emissions from biogas combustion to 14kt of CO 2eq reflects higher 
biogas production volumes in 2022 versus the previous year.

As a business that operates in a land-intensive sector Astarta will consider joining the Science 
Based Targets initiative (SBTi) Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG). With this in mind, the 
Company also started to calculate emissions with the breakdown on FLAG and non-FLAG 
emissions.

The FLAG emissions increased by 5% to 556kt of CO 2eq with 69% share of all emissions due to 
the higher volumes of GHG emissions from land management. The non -FLAG emissions 
decreased by 13% to 250kt of CO 2eq due to lower fossil fuel and purchased electricity 
consumption. 
Acting on Climate Change 
The russian invasion of Ukraine led to the significant damage to the environment with the 
impact spreading well beyond Ukrainian borders. It threatens t he ambition of global efforts 

Page 51:
 
51 
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 
towards curbing the climate change as the military hostilities cause large -scale emissions of 
greenhouse gases and contamination of the environment with harmful munition -related 
substances. According to the Ukrainian Ministry of Environment the war-related hostilities 
caused nearly 33mt of CO2eq. emissions, numerous fires and mass migration of the Ukrainian 
population. Post-war recovery and reconstruction would add an estimated 49mt of CO2eq. 
At the same time, Ukraine has a well developed agriculture which has a significant potential for 
removing CO2 from the atmosphere and storing it in soil and thus can play an important role in 
climate change mitigation. 
Land use and land use change is the largest component of climate mitigat ion after energy and 
industry. It is estimated that 25 -30% of total human -related emissions come from agriculture, 
forestry and other land use (AFOLU). Agriculture occupies c.40% of global ice -free land, uses 
75-84% of global consumption of water and, amon g others, causes the biodiversity loss at the 
highest rate in history. Conventional agricultural methods also mean that up to 50% of 
synthetic fertilisers are not delivered to plants but sunk into the surface and groundwater or 
emitted into atmosphere contributing to the temperature rise. 
Scientists call for taking out 10 -30% of land out of agricultural production for ecological 
conservation and, if done via reforestation, the decarbonisation would be an additional benefit. 
Water and fertilizer use can be reduced via precise application and soil analysis, and recycling 
of at least 50% of nutrients (manure, sewage, food processing waste). 
There is need to increase efficiency of water use by drip irrigation, recirculation in greenhouses 
on top of buffering of water resources in lakes and aquifers, and in soil through increasing 
organic matter content. Farmers need to change crop rotation by switching to crops with lower 
water needs in water scarce regions and develop circular farming business model. 
Agriculture has large potential to sequester carbon in plant biomass and in the soil. Worldwide 
soil contains 2,000-2,500Gt of carbon, which is 3X as much as all plants and 2X the amount of 
carbon in atmosphere. Agricultural soils have potential to sequester up to 2.5Gt of CO 2 per 
annum and achieve more than 60% of CO 2 sequestration targets for the Net Zero target 
according to IPPC. 
There are two main ways for increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) in soils and its storage: 
• increase carbon-reach inputs (crop residues, compost, manure) 
• reduce decomposition rate of organic matter and soil carbon losses due to erosion 
(reduced tillage, crop diversity, erosion management). 
It is estimated that agricultural soils lost 30 -75% of original SOC due to conventional farming 
practices. The process of reaching a new SOC stock takes 10 -50 years. Agricultural practices 
for sequestering carbon in the soil and biomass is called “carbon farming”. The main additional 
benefit of these practices is enhanced soil health and plant resili ence to withstand different 
weather patterns. 
As one of the largest agricultural producers in Ukraine, Astarta is actively studying and utilising 
the elements of carbon and regenerative farming across its farmlands such as cover cropping, 
diversified crop rotation, crop residue covering, reduced tillage, organic fertilisers etc. The 
Company also has an in -house soil analysis laboratory and a unique database with a tight grid 
covering most of the fields under operational management. All key soil nutrients are regularly 
collected and monitored, and this information is used for adjusting the key soil fertility 
parameters.  

Page 52:
 
52 
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 
By way of example, Differentiated Sowing and S-Control Monopile techniques tailor the amount 
of planting material to the specific land plot and allow increasing productivity of crops while 
saving on seeds. Astarta also actively uses other solutions such as AgriChain Scout - one of the 
key modules of AgriChain, Astarta’s proprietary IT software system. It allows for remote 
monitoring of the crop growth process on its fields. In 2022 a new module was added to 
AgriChain Scout to include automated soil sampling for further analysis in the laboratory. The 
soil sampling crew drives to a selected field under the app guidance to take samples from 
specific segments.  
Additionally, an application from the US “Planet Labs”, specialising in Earth observation from 
space, was integrated into AgriChain Scout, to monitor condition of crops such as the level of 
vegetation, and the quality of seedlings in the fie lds by satellites equipped with a high -
resolution telescope.  
The increase in the average annual temperature and lower precipitation levels in Ukraine 
command a gradual change of crop mix towards a higher share of winter crops such as wheat 
and rapeseeds. Astarta’s total acreage under winter crops increased from 54kha in 2021 to 
62kha in 2022. The is also an increased focus on drought resistant varieties of spring crops, 
applying reduced tillage to preserve moisture in the ground, tailoring density of sowin g and 
fertiliser application to specific soil conditions. 
Another possible area of expansion for Astarta under changing climate conditions is irrigation. 
Currently, 500ha of its land is under irrigation and there is significant potential for expansion in 
the future. 
Agricultural science links climate risk mitigation to sequestration of carbon in soil and, at the 
same time, improving its health and productivity. The Company continued to follow a set of 
recommendations on regenerative practices developed within a project with Syngenta LLC 
(Ukraine). To measure the impact from change in farming practices Astarta developed a 
Baseline report for 2020 and monitors the carbon sequestration results on an annual basis 
through the Cool Farm Tool. 
Decarbonisation of the industrial processes of Astarta’s business has been long established via 
reduction of natural gas consumption at the sugar mills under the energy efficiency programme 
of BAT (best available technology) and introduction of the bioenergy pellets as an alte rnative 
source of energy for beet pulp drying instead of natural gas. 
Also in Sugar Production and Soybean Processing Astarta uses biogas from an inhouse biogas 
facility to replace natural gas consumption. This biogas facility uses sugar beet pulp, a residue 
from sugar production, as a primary raw material for biogas production. In 2022 replacement 
of natural gas with biogas reached 10% out of total gas consumption in the Sugar Production 
segment versus 2% in 2021, and in the Soybean Processing segment biogas substituted 50% 
of total gas needs versus negligible amount in 2021. 
In 2022 Astarta continued reporting under the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) on its activities 
aimed at climate change adaptation and mitigation. 
In 2022 Astarta entered into a tri -party agreement with the EBRD and EY to develop a 
comprehensive system of climate corporate governance. Under the project the Company 
enhanced its GHG calculation for Scope 1-3, was provided with a climate scenario analysis for 
1.5-4ºС growth in global tempe rature, identified physical and transitional climate risks, 
analysed existing and prospective decarbonisation initiatives.

Waste 
GRI-306; SDG-3, SDG-6, SDG-12 
As a big agroindustrial holding Astarta generates hazardous and non -hazardous waste in the 
process of its daily operating activities. The separate waste collection and temporary storage 
comply with domestic legislation and internal standards. Before disposing of hazardous and 
non-hazardous waste, it is temporary stored in special yards with mark ed boxes for waste 
sorting. To dispose the hazardous and non -hazardous waste, Astarta cooperates with 
companies that are reputable and licensed by relevant authorities to handle such waste. Within 
waste recovery operations these companies can obtain valuable components or incinerate 
waste for energy generation. 
The waste generated by the Company is determined by the level of hazard: 1 st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th 
categories in line with national requirements. The share of hazardous waste is negligible and 
mainly comes from fluorescent lamps, battery packs, used oils, used packaging of pesticides, 
fertilizers, other chemical materials etc. 
Non-hazardous waste generated by the Company mainly includes residue from the production 
process such as paper, plastic, waste from packaging materials, used tires etc.  
Solid household waste generated within the Company’s activity is disposed at landfills. 
In the process of sugar beets processing Astarta produces sugar and generates by -products 
such as sugar beet pulp and molasses. Sugar is sold mainly in 25kg, 50kg and 1000kg 
polypropylene bags as well as in bulk. Bags for sugar packaging are supplied by third parties. 
Customers who buy sugar in bags can either dispose of or reuse these bags. Molasses is sold 
as is while sugar beet pulp is partially baked into a granulated product and partially used as a 
feed for livestock. 
The Sugar Production segment also generates filtration sludge in the technological process. 
This type of waste has two fractions: dry and wet. The wet fraction is disposed to the absorption 
fields. The dry fraction is used for absorption fields maintenance. Other waste generated by the 
segment comes from input materials such as technological inputs, batteries, materials for 
laboratory and transport maintenance which are sent on for further disposal by third parties. 
The key products produced by the Agricultural segment are grains and oilseeds as well as 
sugar beets. Grains and oilseeds are sold in bulk mainly for exports and sugar beets are 
processed internally by t he Sugar Production segment. The Agricultural segment generates 
organic residue after harvesting row crops. Some of the residue are left in the fields to preserve 
soil and some are used in cattle farming as bedding for cows. 
There is also some plant-based residue generated in silo handling of grains and oilseeds which 
are partially disposed to landfills and partially sold. The residue which is sold can be processed 
into pellets, feeds, and animal bedding. The Agriculture segment also generates waste from 
operating and maintenance of machinery and transport as well as packaging from pesticides 
and fertilisers which are further utilized by relevant companies. 
Soybean meal and oil are the key products in soybean crushing which are sold in bulk. The by -
product of the crushing process is husk which is sold to third parties. The Soybean P rocessing 
segment also generates waste during the process of cleaning equipment, wastewater 
treatment, and replacement of filters in dust and gas treatment installations. 

Page 54:
 
54 
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 
Milk is the key product of the Cattle Farming segment. The milk is sold in bulk without 
packaging. Manure generated on the cattle farms is applied as fertilizer on the fields in the 
Agricultural segment. The Cattle Farming generates waste from use of veterinary in puts and 
medicines derived from animal healthcare. 
The Company initiated development of automated system for data collection for waste. Thus, 
the data on waste generated, diverted from disposal and directed to disposal will be presented 
after implementation of this system. 
Animal Welfare 
The war, provoked by russia, created unprecedented challenges for Ukrainian farmers and 
animals in the areas directly and indirectly affected by military hostilities. Livestock suffered 
immensely from abuse, injury, or death in such areas. Thus, the issue of animal welfare is one 
of the key concerns in Ukraine. 
Astarta's dairy farms didn't suffer losses but prioritized the importance of humane treatment 
and animal health and welfare. Thus, amidst the occupation of the Northe rn Ukrainian 
territories, Astarta provided temporary shelter at its dairy farms for more than one thousand 
rescued and relocated cows from the Kharkiv region. 
The Company strongly believes that animals should be treated well; thus, actions to improve 
herd welfare are constantly in focus. In 2022 improvements included: the reconstruction of 
premises for loose keeping equipment for 770 stalls with special comfortable bedding, and 
improved insect management by installing electric insect killers on farms.  
Astarta ensures good animal living conditions in the cowshed and during outdoor grazing. In 
the cowshed cows have thick mattresses, sufficient room to move and walk around, massage 
brushes, constant access to clean drinking water, and balanced and timely f eed. At times of 
power outages, generators were installed to meet 
the farm's needs. 
The Company believes that a healthy cow produces 
more milk, of better quality, and for longer. 
Moreover, a healthy and more productive herd helps 
to reduce environmental im pact by lower 
greenhouse gas intensity per litre of milk produced. 
This is why the Company focuses on animal welfare, 
nutrition, health, and productivity. 
Astarta constantly monitors the somatic cell count (SCC) by analyzing milk each time it is 
collected from the farm. An elevated level of somatic cells in milk can indicate inflammation or 
mastitis, which causes pain and stress to the animal and lowers milk quality. At Astarta, the 
somatic cell count in milk is always kept within the range of 200 -300k cells/ml, while the state 
standard requires that extra -grade milk has up to 400k somatic cells/ml. Apart from SCC 
control of milk at dairy farms, individual cow monitoring for subclinical mastitis infection is 
carried out twice per month to effectively prevent  and control inflammations, thus creating 
more efficient and sustainable dairy systems. 
Astarta regularly adjusts feed mix that enhances balanced nutrition, improve feed conversion 
ratio, and promote animal welfare and health. In 2022, the Company conducte d extensive 
research on animal feed to maximize efficiency when calculating rations. Both raw (green 
mass) and finished feed components (haylage, silage) were examined. Based on these 

Page 55:
 
55 
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 
findings, feed rations at Astarta’s Feed Centre were adjusted to better satisfy animals' needs 
for nutrients and minerals. This allowed for the daily unit milk yield to increase from 22.6 to 
23.6kg. 
The Company's digital automated ProFeed animal feeding system was operational at nine 
farms out of 35, unchanged from the previou s year. Due to constant power outages and 
internet disruptions caused by russian missile attacks, the IT team developed offline backup 
version to ensure the integrity of the system. 
In 2022 Astarta continued the implementation of the HACCP (Hazard Analysis  and Critical 
Control Points) activities plan at all dairy farms. The Company's livestock personnel seek 
practices that enhance animal well-being and productivity, especially those that reduce stress 
and increase yields. 
In 2022 Astarta's dairy farms were included into the Raw Milk Control Programme run by the 
State Food and Consumer Service within the Quality FOOD Trade Programme framework. Its 
main objective is to increase the added value in domestic trade from the dairy sector for 
sustainable growth in Ukraine. 
Basic animal welfare pillars  
 
Sustainable Procurement 
The Company developed and implemented the Standard on sustainable procurement which is 
a part of the Company’s Integrated Corporate Management system. This standard determines 
ESG evaluation process of suppliers at all stages. Part of the standard is the sustainable 
agreement as an addendum to the main contract with the supplier, as well as sustainability 
questionnaire, which the supplier is required to fill in. The sustainable agreement stipulates key 
requirements in the social and ecological spheres to the suppliers that work with the Company. 
Among these requirements are: 
• Prohibition of child and forced labour; 
• Refuse from any type of discrimination; 
• Freedom of associations 
• Rationale natural resources use 


Page 56:
 
56 
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 
• Ensure minimisation of use of packaging materials and work towards its recyclability 
• Consider climate change issues in the business  
Also, the employees are required to give feedback about their experience with the suppliers. 
This information is collected, analysed and used by the procurement department to form a 
register of qualified suppliers. 
According to the Standard on sustainable procurement the Company conducts 
permanent monitoring of its suppliers in respect of the following  issues:  
Administrative 
Management 
Constant improvement in procurement and supply of products and 
services, development of decision -making procedure on supplier 
relationship. 
 
Human Rights 
The selection process of suppliers includes due diligence on human 
rights. Contract termination with supplier if employees’ 
discrimination is detected. Requiring suppliers to respect political, 
economic, social rights and freedoms as part of the contract. 
 
Personnel 
Management 
Requirement and verif ication of compliance with appropriate 
working conditions by the supplier, including ongoing performance 
audit by the Company as a customer. Monitoring of social protection 
granted by the supplier for its employees, the level of competence 
and training for employees. 
 
Environment Verification and enforcement of contractors with due diligence on 
environmental issues, conservation of natural resources, pursuit of 
activities considering the impact on climate change and prevention 
of these risks, prevention of negative impact on biodiversity and 
waste management. 
 
Transparent Business

Human Capital 
GRI-401; SDG-8 
Astarta believes that people are its most vulnerable and valuable capital. Thus, since the start 
of the full-scale russian invasion of Ukraine safety of the employees and their families became 
the utmost priority for the Company. Office -based personnel worked remotely from home and 
shelters while production -based employees performed their duties when it is safe to do so. 
Many employees had to relocate from homes to other Ukrainia n regions, as well as send their 
families abroad. Some workers had been called into the military reserve and their colleagues 
were filling the gaps in the workplace. 
To support its employees the Company introduced special programme covering physical safety  
of employees, financial and psychological support, including for those drafted into the Army 
and their families. More than 300 employees were provided financial and non -financial 
assistance under such programme. 
Despite the war Astarta continued creating conditions, opportunities and incentives through 
different projects to stimulate engagement and professional development of its employees.  
• The Operational Improvement System of Astarta (OISA).  This is a management system 
designed for improving business pr ocesses and the involvement of each employee in the 
process of continuous improvement. In 2022 1,173 employees participated in the 
programme with 1,158 improvement ideas submitted. The economic benefits from such 
ideas totalled UAH11m in 2022. 
• Successors Development. The programme is aimed at career development and training of 
personnel for key management positions. Potential candidates undergo the training 
programme for 1-3-year before being promoted to key management positions. 
• Staff Reserve. The project aims to identify talented employees with potential leadership 
skills. Having selected such employees, the Company conducts special training to create a 
talent pool for potential senior positions. 
• Think Tank . The project’s goal is to collect ideas on effici ency improvements from the 
company’s employees. This allows to identify creative and motivated individuals who are 
ready to take leadership role in transformation processes within the business and, at the 
same time, stimulate engagement of other employees. 
• School of Internal Experts. The key purpose of the project is to share knowledge and 
successful experience within the Company by providing opportunities for self-realisation of 
employees. 
Employment  
Astarta conducts its business nationwide, thus hiring people in different regions of Ukraine. 
As of the end of 2022 the total number of employees was 6,591, up by 37% y -o-y as the 
Company had to reserve seasonal personnel during the martial law. Correspondingly the share 
of seasonal employees increased  from 16% in 2021 to 37% in 2022. The breakdown of 
employees by age remained almost unchanged while the breakdown of employees by gender 
and professional level slightly changed reflecting an increase in seasonal employees.

Minimum Notice Periods Regarding Operational Changes 
GRI-402 
Astarta abides by the requirements of corresponding national legislation in relation to minimum 
notice periods prior to operational changes. 
In case the Company plans operational changes that can impact labour conditions of 
employees, it notifies the affected individuals or their representative two months before the

a trade union, the notification is made three months before the planned changes. 
There is also a minimum notice period set by the collective agreements. According to a 
standard agreement the minimum notice period is two months before the planned changes. 
Occupational Health and Safety 
GRI 403, SDG-3 
In 2022 Astarta’s occupational and health safety system faced the unprecedented challenges 
as a result of the military hostilities from by full-scale russian invasion of Ukraine. No 
occupational and health safety system, unfortunately, could fully protect people in the country 
which was attacked by russia. 

Page 61:

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 
One of Astarta’s employee - a civilian tractor driver working in the field - died from being hit by a 
guided missile fired from a russian military aircraft far away from the battlefield. 
Nevertheless, Astarta continued putting best e fforts into the area of occupation health and 
safety as a top priority even under the war-related circumstances. 
Prevention of injuries, professional ailments, car accidents, emergency situations, and fatalities 
are all prioritized areas. The Company identifies risks related to the occupational health and 
safety performing an analysis of the technological processes, parameters, and technical 
characteristics of the equipment (substances) used. The Company controls parameters of 
working conditions to prevent near misses, first aid and lost time incidents, professional 
diseases. Under Operational Improvement System of Astarta employees create ideas for 
improving working conditions, among others. In 2022 employees generated 615 health and 
safety-related initiatives. 
During the reporting period the Company worked towards mitigating the impact of hazardous 
factors in the high-risk workplaces in the Sugar segment. To minimize noise and high 
temperature at the certain workplaces, Astarta installed noise-insulation and air conditioning in 
the operator's room. Additionally, ventilation and aspiration equipment were installed for 
cooling and catching air contaminants. 
According to the Ukr ainian labour legislation employees involved in high -risk works receive 
additional benefits which are provided by the Company. 
In line with engineering and technical measures to minimize the negative impact of hazards in 
the workplace, Astarta provides employees with high-quality personal protective equipment for 
respiratory, visual, hearing, and skin protection. 
The Company is continuing to implement a 5S system for efficient, effective, and safe work 
performance in sugar production, soybean processing, ag riculture and biogas production. This 
system aims organising the workspaces in a way that will provide maximum safety and 
productivity for an employee. 
The Company makes every effort to ensure the safety of contractors performing work. The 
contractors must  provide Astarta with work permits, licenses, and other health and safety -
specific documents. The Company decides to engage a contractor based on an assessment. 
The Company allows to perform work only for those contractors that meets the established 
requirements. Its occupational health and safety specialists carry out supervision during the 
contractors' performance. They monitor compliance with laws and other regulations on labour 
protection and conduct health and safety induction training course. 
Astarta constantly conducts training and knowledge testing on health and safety issues under 
the internal Standard “Education and Expertise”. In 2022 4,610 participants (one employee 
can participate in several trainings) took part in the training on health and saf ety including 
following key topics: fire safety, electrical safety, road traffic safety, hazardous chemicals, 
incidents investigation, first aid, high-risk works, and high-risk equipment operation. 
There are small medical surgeries at some production facilities where employees can get first 
medical aid and some basic health care procedures. 
All Astarta’s key production assets such as sugar plants, soybean crusher and grain silos 
confirmed compliance with requirements of ISO 45001 – the Occupational health a nd safety 
management systems.

GRI-404; SDG-4 
Management approach to training is based on the internal documents that define common 
rules and requirements. 
Each employee has a right to improve professional skills via training and can apply for such 
under internal procedures. 
The Company identifies the following types and forms of training: long -term and short -term, 
external and internal. 
• Long-term training is provided on the basis of higher education institutions to obtain 
tertiary qualification or in lyceums to master a new trade;

including modernization, reorganisation or restructuring of business units, significant 
changes in the regulatory framework governing its activities, training on best available 
technologies; 
• Internal training is conducted by in-house personnel; 
• External training is conducted by third-party service providers. 
Development of corporate skills is carried out through trainings, master classes, seminars, 
conferences, forums, business games, etc. 
After the training the Human Resources Department conducts appraisal of the level of acquired 
knowledge and skills as well as overall quality of the training. 
Astarta focuses on the professional development of its employees and implements various 
projects that help to reveal and realize their potential. To this end, the Company implemented 
different programmes such as: mentoring targeted at building an effective team, programme 
for development of internal mentors, “school of internal experts”. 
In 2022 Astarta launched another course for internal trainers.  30 employees completed the 
course “training for trainers” focused on the implementation of Operational Improvement 
System of Astarta tool – 5S. The focus of such training was to implement lean production 
approaches, creating and maintaining order at production sites and managing stocks at the 
Company's sugar plants and agricultural subsidiaries. As a result, more than 250 employees 
were trained by internal trainers. 
Considering the positive result  and feedback on the programme the Company launched 
similar course for local employees in the production assets.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 
The Company guarantees  safety at workplace. There is a Corporate Integrated Management 
System in place, the mandatory component of which is employee’s health and occupational 
safety. All production facilities were assessed internally for occupational health and safety 
risks. 
The Ukrainian law prohibits the use of child and forced labour. No person under the age of 18 
works at the production facilities and there were no cases of forced labour at Astarta. The 
Company treats these issues as a matter of principle and strictly adheres to the rule of the law. 
When making economic decisions, the Company always considers and assesses potential risks 
to human rights. Potential cases of human rights violations can be reported to the local 
management team via a dedicated hotline. The procedure for handling complaints and appeals 
is described in the Stakeholder Engagement Plan. 
Astarta performs a regular internal audit to verify compliance with the Human Rights Policy. All 
of the Companies subsidiaries are covered by the audits. The internal audit confirmed that 
there were no violations of human rights at the Company’s business units in 2022. 
The policy is also shared by contractors and subcontractors, who work with the Company. 
Monitoring of potential use of forced and child labour is also included into the Sustainable 
Development Questionnaire for suppliers, which is filled out by them and submitted as part of 
procurement tenders by Astarta. 
As a result of full scale russian invasion of Ukraine, many people faced violence and abuse by 
the russian military. Many Ukrainians were forced to leave their homes and to move to other 
regions of the country as internally displaced persons (IDP). 
In 2022, to help IDP, Astarta launched the project on protection of the rights and interests of 
Ukrainian cit izens during the martial law. The project consisted of dedicated training in 3 
regions of Ukraine involving 90 people. The participants obtained information about state 
guarantees on rights, freedoms and legitimate interests of IDP and local communities acting as 
a host for IDP under the martial law. The training also included information on actions in case 
of sexual and physical violence and destroyed or damaged housing. 
Certification and Sustainable Products and Services 
GRI-416; SDG-12, SDG-16 
Astarta aims to run its production in the most efficient way in terms of economic -soundness 
and sustainability which implies earning profits while minimizing negative environmental 
impact, conserving natural resources and developing communities as well as ensuring high 
product quality and safety. 
In 2022 the Company’s crop growing subsidiary List -Ruchky reconfirmed the status of an 
organic producer and successfully passed the certification of land and warehouses by the 
Organic Standard, BioSuisse, Danube Soya, and Europe Soya. Certification allows the Company 
to sell its organic products to the European Union. In  the reporting period Astarta allocated 
1.8kha for organic farming and produced more almost 4kt of organic wheat, corn, soybeans 
and other crops. Astarta also  uses some organic fertilisers instead of synthetic. In 2022 
organic fertilisers were used on the area of 7kha. 
The Company’s proprietary IT software AgriChain together with other digital solutions allow 
improving operational processes and add to the overall efficiency of the business in terms of

economic return and sustainability. These solutions include farmland management, field 
operations, storage, purchase and supply processes, crop monitoring, agrochemical field 
profile, meteorological data and plant vegetation status. As a result, Astarta improves 
productivity while reducing use of inputs such as fertilizers, seeds, fuel etc. 
The Company continued to follow a set of recommendations on regenerative practices 
developed in cooperation with Syngenta LLC (Ukraine). To measure the impact from change in 
farming practices Astarta developed a Baseline report for 2020 and monitors the carbon 
sequestration results on an annual basis through the Cool Farm Tool. 
Astarta plans to scale up different ele ments of carbon farming, for example reduced tillage, 
cover crops, nitrification inhibitors, organic fertilisers. In 2022 the Company performed reduced 
tillage on 106kha and cover crops, nitrification inhibitors, organic fertilisers on 11kha. 
Within the re generative farming framework, the Company also entered into the project with 
Agreena - a soil carbon platform for farmers aimed at scaling regenerative agriculture practices 
through finance and technology. The project aims to conduct assessment, monitoring  and 
verification of greenhouse gas emission reductions resulting from change in farming practices 
on the assigned land area. Generation of Voluntary Carbon Credits for sale is also part of the 
project design. 
In Sugar P roduction and Soybean P rocessing Ast arta uses biogas from an inhouse biogas 
facility to replace natural gas consumption. This biogas facility uses sugar beet pulp, a residue 
from sugar production, as a primary input. Therefore, use of biogas not only adds to the 
sustainability aspect to the business but reduces costs amid high energy prices. 
One of the key sustainability elements of the Company’s business is the quality of its products 
which correspond to international standards. Astarta’s key production assets are certified in 
accordance with FSSC, ISO 22000, GMP+, ISCC and HACCP standards. To ensure high quality 
and safety of products, the Company constantly controls raw materials and other inputs. The 
main criteria for quality and safety of raw materials are defined by national and internat ional 
regulatory and technological documents (TU, DSTU, Council of Europe Directives, etc.), and 
include GMO content, microbiological indicators, pesticides, radionuclides, among others. 
In 2022 Astarta’s soybean processing plant received the ISCC EU certification indicating 
sustainable nature of the products and allowing the Company to attract new clients. 
Astarta puts special emphasis on the quality and safety of its milk production. The quality is 
determined by fat, protein and water content, as well as density and freezing point. Food safety 
control includes an assessment of antibiotics’ use, cow health, the quality and safety of the 
feed, the sanitary and hygienic requirements and the temperature of the milk cooler tanks. 
To strengthen the food safety system, the Company also monitors risks related to malicious 
spoilage of food products and vulnerabilities to falsified food. 
In 2022 there were no cases of non -compliance with regulations on health and safety of 
products identified.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 
In June 2022 the Annual General Meeting of shareholders resolved not to distribute dividends 
for the 2021 financial year, since the primary focus for the Сompany was supporting the 
resilience of the business under the war conditions and continuity of the operational 
processes. 
Global stock markets sustained significant losses during 2022 amid the russian invasion of 
Ukraine, growing risk of inflation and tightening monetary policy. A starta’s share price was 
deeply affected by increased volatility and military hostilities overwhelming the economy and 
Ukrainian listed companies. In January 2022 the news of possible invasion put pressure on the 
share price and, after the start of war, it  reached its annual low of PLN14.2. The average share 
price plunged by 54% y -o-y in Polish Zloty to PLN24.5 during the reporting period. Astarta daily 
trading volume climbed to nearly 0.4m trades on February 24, 2022, on the day of full-scale 
invasion. Trading volumes soared to new record highs in March, reaching 3.4m trades monthly. 
Over time, when the military situation on the ground improved and the Ukrainian army 
conducted successful counteroffensives and liberated some occupied territories the share 
price started to recover. 
Seaborne grain exports which restarted in August 2022 had a positive impact on shares of the 
Ukrainian listed companies, since the deal had a potential to increase agricultural producers’ 
monthly grain exports. However, numerous execution risks and Russia’s attempts to disrupt the 
Grain Deal continue to weigh on the stocks’ volatility.
