Introduction
Introduction 
Prosus is a global consumer 
internet group and a long-term 
technology investor. We combine 
our global reach with local 
expertise, building meaningful 
businesses in online classifieds, 
food-delivery, payments and 
fintech, and education 
technology sectors in high-
growth markets. We serve 
communities around the world 
through our portfolio of digital 
platforms that operate asset-
light, low-carbon business 
models. 
Environmental impact and emissions data reporting is 
business-activity, location and market specific. For us, 
environmental impact reporting is about being transparent 
and taking action to protect our planet. 
We describe our environmental strategy, governance, risks 
and opportunity assessment, along with our targets and 
commitments in our environmental sustainability programme. 
This annual environmental impact report provides an update 
on the progress made against our environmental commitments 
and targets over the year gone by, and it also shares a 
perspective on the key objectives for the year ahead.
In this report we include three scopes of our environmental 
impact:
1  Our own operations (direct and indirect emissions)
2  Our extended operational activities (indirect supply chain 
emissions)
3  Our investment portfolio (indirect emissions)

Environmental performance indicators
Climate
Across our diverse group of companies, we have defined a key set of environmental data points on which we collate and report 
performance updates on an annual basis. These allow us to apply a consistent approach in the measurement and reporting of 
our performance on most material environmental impact areas.

Over the past five years, we have been tracking, reporting and auditing our carbon emissions data annually. The scope 1 and 2 
emissions data of Prosus corporate, as well as that of its portfolio companies where it has a controlling interest, go through an 
audit engagement every reporting cycle as ’affiliates’ to the Naspers group (the majority shareholder of Prosus group) and it has  
obtained limited assurance for the past four reporting years (FY20 to FY23). 
We include historical data from FY20, which is the base year for our climate target setting for a comprehensive overview of our 
emissions inventory.
Climate data – Our own operations 
Our corporate operations that meet the materiality threshold to be included in our emissions reporting is limited to offices in five 
locations around the world. These emissions generated are consequent to the provision of a workplace for our corporate 
employees, and related use of resources are included in the scopes 1, 2 and 3 reporting.

Scope 1 emissions
We use emission factors from the Intergovernmental Panel for 
Climate Change (IPCC) to calculate scope 1 emissions. Scope 
1 emissions from our corporate offices are consequent to the 
use of fossil fuel-based vehicles. The Amsterdam office uses 
renewable energy for heating and cooling purposes with the 
Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage system (ATES), which extracts/
injects groundwater to achieve heating and cooling of the 
building.
The reduction observed in scope 1 emissions from FY20 is the 
result of reducing the number of leased cars from 11 in FY20 
to five in FY23 and running fewer kilometres per car. In FY23, 
we decided to dispose of all internal combustion engine 
vehicles from our corporate office’s asset register to ensure we 
achieved the target to reduce scope 1 from our operations to 
zero, which was a key metric in our group CEO and CFO’s 
short-term incentives (see the remuneration section in our FY23 
annual report).
Scope 2 emissions
Purchased electricity for our corporate offices and to power 
our electric vehicles, accounts for our scope 2 emissions (two 
electric and two hybrid cars at the Amsterdam office). With all 
our Prosus offices being leased premises, the electricity usage 
is prorated as per the occupancy of office space and common 
space as defined by the lease agreements. The majority of 
our corporate employee population is based at the 
Amsterdam office. We have four other leased office facilities 
within our reporting boundary where we have more than 10 
employees: London, San Francisco, Hong Kong and Bengaluru. 
A small number of employees work permanently from their 
home offices. We procure 100% renewable energy for our 
Amsterdam and London offices.
The increase in scope 2 emissions from FY22 to FY23 is 
reflective of the addition of two office locations (London and 
Bengaluru) under our scope of reporting. In FY23, we 
implemented three core actions to ensure we reach our target 
to reduce scope 2 emissions to zero, which was a key metric 
in our group CEO and CFO’s short-term incentives: 
1  where possible, we engaged with our leasing agency to 
install on-site solar panels; 
2  where available on the grid, we procured green energy; 
and 
3  for all remaining energy consumption, we procured 
equivalent renewable-energy certificates. 
For this coming year, it is our intention to continue making 
further progress on this pathway and increasing the ratio of 
green-energy procurement to renewable-energy certificates.
The market-based method includes emissions calculations that 
consider the purchasing decisions based on contractual 
emissions. For grey electricity, the emission factors used are 
derived from the Internal Energy Agency (IEA).
Climate data – Our supply chain
A large portion of the emissions in our extended value chain 
are under the control of our suppliers and business partners 
and we expect our suppliers to take action to report and 
reduce their environmental footprint (see our supplier code of 
conduct) when we do business with them.

Scope 3 emissions
We are continuously working to improve on our scope 3 measurements and disclosures that enable us to better manage 
emissions arising from the category of activities that are material to our operations and business. FY20 has been defined as our 
base year for our climate targets. For comparability of our emissions profile over the four-year period, we include data from FY20 
to FY23 (our current reporting year) in this report.

Supplier engagement programme
At our corporate operations, more than 95% of our procurement activities are related to professional services such as consultants, 
lawyers, accountants and auditors. The small volume of products we procure are IT hardware and other office supplies. 
Consequently, we do not have any business-critical or significant suppliers, but we work with a range of trusted business partners 
that support our work. 
In FY23, we had commercial relationships with roughly 3 400 suppliers. Our entire supplier base is screened for compliance with 
ESG standards, on human rights and environmental performance, using a third-party tool assessing our suppliers 24/7 to help 
identify any areas of concern. The tool alerts us if any risks are identified, which allows us to either accept the risk, engage the 
supplier for further information and/or corrective measures or start a process of removing the vendor from our supplier base.
This year, we articulated the ESG standards and behaviours we expect of our suppliers in our supplier code of conduct and we 
will implement the necessary processes and policies to make this code part of our procurement and commercial relationships 
and contracts with our supplier base. We anticipate realising a full coverage of our supplier contracts in the coming years, as we 
apply a phased implementation following the natural expiry and renegotiations of existing contracts. All corporate employees 
who engage with suppliers are informed of our process of ESG risk management in our supply chain and supplier code of 
conduct.

During FY23 we conducted an engagement pilot with our most significant corporate suppliers based on spend, requesting 
absolute data on their emissions and information on their climate plans. We wanted to test and better understand if our suppliers 
are collating their emissions and are able to provide GHG emissions data relative to the scope of their services to us. 
Furthermore, we were keen to assess how many of our vendors are taking climate action by setting targets and reporting their 
emissions data. Below are the results from this pilot:
Table 7: Supplier engagement pilot results
Supplier engagement data Share
Suppliers included in engagement survey (% of total spend) 37%
Suppliers responded to survey (% of total spend) 30%
Suppliers that provided primary GHG data (% of total spend) 30%
Suppliers that have climate targets (% of total spend) 30%
Suppliers with verified science-based targets (% of total spend) 16%
Primary data GHG emissions reduces emissions estimations with (%) 90%
90% of the suppliers included in the pilot, representing 30% of 
our total FY22 procurement spend, shared their primary 
emissions data with us. However, only a few were able to 
allocate the exact emissions associated with the contracted 
work or supplied services. Most suppliers were able to 
provide their emissions intensity per revenues. This allowed us 
to make a more accurate calculation of the emissions 
generated from their services, compared to a spend-based 
method using average GHG emissions intensities per industry 
that we had used the year before. A critical insight for us was 
that compared to calculations based on extrapolations using 
average sector emissions intensity, emissions collated-based 
primary data received from our suppliers were 90% lower. 
Which is a strong incentive for us to continue on the supplier 
engagement programme going forward.
Table 8: Scope 3 category 6 emissions of corporate air business travel
A substantial source of GHG emissions is our business travel, resulting from the need to engage with and grow our 
geographically diversified investment portfolio. Consequently, we have set a target of a 30% reduction in our corporate air travel 
emissions by FY30, with the base year as FY20.

Emissions (tCO2e) 2 133  325  72  5 303 
We also learned that 30% of our supplier base (based on 
spend) have set climate reduction targets. Moreover, most of 
these targets are verified by SBTi, representing about 16% of 
total spend. While this a relatively high share (globally, about 
4 000 companies have set science-based targets, on a total of 
over 300 million companies, less than 1%), we recognise we 
have a role to play in encouraging and supporting our 
suppliers to start or increase their efforts on climate. The 
roll-out of our supplier code of conduct supports this 
opportunity, by defining climate accounting, the basis of 
climate action, as a clear expectation of all our suppliers.

Climate continued
The steep reduction of air travel emissions in the years FY21 
and FY22 resulted from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic 
when travel was not possible. This has taught us to embrace 
technology to continue to do our work and collaborate with 
colleagues and business partners across the world. 
In FY23 we moved to a new travel agent to book, manage 
and report our business travel. The advantages of using this 
agent are consistency and higher quality of data and 
measurements, and more real-time tools and insights for the 
management of travel. During the second half of FY23 we saw 
a sizable reduction in corporate staff, which will have a 
longer-term result in lowering the emissions from air business 
travel. Equally, cost containment and reduction of staff 
members will result in a continued reduction of travel and 
associated emissions.
Climate data – Our investment portfolio
Our investment portfolio generates environmental impacts 
from the development and operation of their digital platforms 
and online service delivery models. Their extended value 
chain impacts are linked to the products and services of their 
business partners and suppliers and to the footprint of their 
customers. 
It is important to note that the composition of our portfolio can 
be significantly dynamic due to the nature of our business 
activities as an investor. Significant new acquisitions and/or 
unbundling of holdings can materially impact the boundaries 
within this category. Furthermore, as our portfolio companies 
mature in their GHG emissions accounting, the scope and 
robustness of their emissions data will also improve.

Portfolio companies
High-quality carbon accounting is the backbone of climate action, and proactively support our portfolio companies to measure 
and report their GHG emissions. It is our shared objective to increase the scope and maturity of emissions reporting every year, 
ultimately establishing the reporting of full scope data, audited externally with reasonable assurance, in support of a multi-year 
science-based reduction target.

Notable changes in GHG emissions from FY22 to FY23 are:
 » eMAG: Scope 2 emissions have reduced significantly due to the increase in the renewable-energy mix in Romania’s grid, where 
eMAG has most of its operations.
 » OLX: Scope 1 emissions have increased due to the growth of leased cars in their LetGo division. A number of OLX office 
facilities and inspection centres closed down, resulting in a reduction in scope 2 emissions.
 » IFood: In FY23 iFood has included dark stores from their grocery business into the scope of accounting, leading to a significant 
increase in their emissions.
 » PayU: Scope 2 emissions show an increasing trend due to an increase in employees returning to the PayU India offices post the 
Covid-19 pandemic.
 » GoodHabitz and Stack Overflow, two recent acquisitions, were included in our scope 1 and 2 emissions accounting and 
reporting.
To assess progress on the decarbonisation journey of our portfolio companies and be able to benchmark their performance to 
sector peers we use the carbon intensity metric as it provides us a better oversight on their ability to decouple their business 
growth from GHG emissions.

 » eMAG has seen a jump in emissions in FY22, while its revenues have seen a slight decline over the years, resulting in a higher 
intensity number due to general market circumstances. eMAG has several programmes, such as installing solar panels and 
increasing electric vehicles, that reduce its scope 1 and 2 emissions. 
 » OLX’s revenues decreased with 37% after deciding to exit its Autos business, which resulted in higher carbon intensity and 
impacting the comparability of the indicator across the years.
 » PayU kept its emissions steady while it increased its revenues, showing a decline in the intensity and thereby a decarbonisation 
of its business.
 » While iFood was successful in growing its revenues with 38%, its intensity figure was impacted by the higher growth of its 
emissions (+500%) after growing its use of dark stores for its grocery delivery business. The network of these stores is carefully 
tested and optimised, triggering future developments in this area.

The primary contributors to the increase in energy 
consumption for FY23 are the increase in number of operating 
sites belonging to Takealot, increase in operating activities at 
Takealot, and the inclusion of dark stores under iFood’s 
reporting boundary. 
Renewable-energy consumption has increased due to the 
instalment of solar panels in several of eMAG’s distribution 
centres, and the move from non-renewable contracts to green 
contracts for some locations. 
Furthermore, renewable-energy generation has increased due 
to the installation of solar panels in several of eMAG’s 
distribution centres, and the transition to increased green- 
energy procurement at some of the locations. 
Table 15: Investments in climate solutions 
The table below provides an overview of operational 
expenditure (opex) and capital expenditure (capex) 
investments in climate solutions. Decarbonisation requires our 
portfolio companies to make investments in technology 
solutions, such as renewable-energy and low-emissions 
transportation for delivery. This has to be balanced against a 
groupwide business imperative to reach profitability. We use 
the EU Taxonomy criteria to define investments in climate 
solutions.

Portfolio companies where we have a minority 
interest
Our portfolio of investments also comprises listed and 
non-listed assets where we have a minority/non-controlling 
stake in, associates and investees.
While our ability to influence the operations and business 
strategies of these companies is limited, we do take the 
opportunity, where possible, to engage with them on their 
climate action journey.
With the vast geographical and business model diversity of 
our associates and investees, along with the maturity of their 
operations ranging from stock-listed giants such as Tencent to 
young and highly innovative earlier-stage businesses in our 
venture’s portfolio – understandably, their ESG maturity and 
performance also varies.
It is also important to highlight that our portfolio also remains 
dynamic with significant new acquisitions and/or unbundling 
of holdings that can materially impact the boundaries within 
the scope of our minority-controlled portfolio companies. 
Furthermore, as the companies in our portfolio mature in their 
GHG accounting we have observed a natural improvement in 
the scope and robustness of their emissions data. 
The table below provides an overview of the scope 1 and 2 
emissions of our portfolio of associates and investees, 
adjusted for our shareholdings, as per the PCAF-financed 
emissions methodology. To highlight, these are estimated 
emissions, calculated using sector averages of emissions 
intensity data per revenue.

Biodiversity
We are building our understanding of the interdependency of our group with nature and biodiversity, the risks we run to 
negatively impact nature and the actions we can take to reduce these. As a first step, we are mapping and locating the direct 
biodiversity interfaces and dependencies (eg related to the direct operational business activities) of our portfolio companies, as 
prescribed by TNFD’s promoted LEAP (locate – evaluate – assess – prepare) method. From there, we will evaluate and assess the

Resource use – Packaging
In our Food Delivery and Etail segments packaging is a material environmental risk as well as an opportunity. We collect data 
from our subsidiaries on their packaging and track performance on key indicators.
Packaging in Etail
In our Etail portfolio companies, where there is a material packaging footprint, eMAG, Takealot and Media24 Logistics report the 
volumes of processed packaging in their operations, which is waste generated from packaging they receive from their suppliers 
and business partners. This packaging is out of their direct control in terms of determining the type of packaging, as it is used by 
their suppliers and business partners for the shipment of goods to their warehouses. Packaging that is directly procured and used 
by the Etail companies, which they use for the logistics and shipment of goods to their clients, is reported in table 18.
Table 17: Processed packaging materials of Etail companies

Other 337 500 17% 67 33 0.1
Total 2 014 115 100% 94 6 0
M24 Logistics and Takealot are both engaging customers to 
refrain from repacking bulky boxed items sufficiently protected 
by their original packaging, and choosing to ship certain 
goods, like white goods, in their original packaging and 
reducing the need to repackage. 
All Etail companies work with professional waste management 
companies that collect the waste and process it to be 
recycled, incinerated or landfilled. 
Packaging that is procured by the Etail companies is used for 
the transportation and shipment of the goods bought on their 
ecommerce platforms. This packaging is often delivered to the 
homes of consumers or ends there after picking the parcel up 
from a pick-up station.

In FY23 we published a report that introduces 10 golden rules 
for scaling sustainable packaging for digital delivery 
companies, showcasing a host of initiatives our Food Delivery 
and Etail companies are taking and can take to fight waste 
and increase resource efficiency. For instance, plastic products 
like tape and fillers are being replaced with recyclable paper 
alternatives. 
Etailer eMAG is working hard on consolidation and efficient 
wrapping of its parcels, reducing significant volumes of 
material. Takealot has trailed reusable pallet wraps to prevent 
the use of unrecyclable plastic variants and has invested in 
collection points at its collection centres. For more examples, 
please see our scaling sustainable packaging report.
Packaging in Food Delivery
Our Food Delivery business iFood measures the volume of 
packaging used by their restaurant partners. The packaging is 
outside of the direct control of iFood and in order to be able 
to measure and estimate the volumes of packaging used, it 
has developed an extensive model and approach. Under 
iFood’s sustainable packaging programme, and driven by its 
target to reduce plastic pollution from delivery with 50% by 
2025, it is involved in multiple efforts to help restaurant 
partners shift to more sustainable packaging and reduce the 
waste generated from it.

The volumes under ‘Plastic avoided’ is the result of iFoods’ 
‘Amigos da Natureza’ initiative, which motivates restaurants to 
join the programme to opt out of offering disposable items like 
cutlery and napkins to its customers. In FY23, iFood motivated 
90% of its restaurant partners to join this programme. As a 
result, an average of 130 tonnes of single-use plastic is 
prevented from being discarded every month.
Packaging used in grocery delivery is mostly plastic bags. This 
data does not account for the packaging of the groceries itself 
that is in control of the grocery brand and out of scope for 
iFood.
Resource use – water and waste 
Our investments portfolio is made up of digital platforms with 
asset-light operations and limited physical infrastructure. Water 
and waste are not material for the businesses that are 
web-based and do not involve manufacturing or processing 
activities. Their primary water use is municipal water for 
limited office infrastructure. 
Furthermore, our portfolio companies use cloud-based services 
(from providers like AWS, Azure, and local companies) and do 
not own data centres that would rely on water for cooling. 
Consequently, there is no direct responsibility or control over 
water use in operations, which lies with their suppliers and 
business partners. Waste generation is only material for our 
Etail businesses, discussed under ‘Packaging in Etail’
For our headquarters in Amsterdam, where most of our 
employees are based, the only water usage is municipal 
water for our office space. The office is part of the municipal 
ecosystem where water treatment facilities clean sewer water 
before releasing it into surface water. Our office in Amsterdam 
is BREEAM certified (BREEAM certificate number: 1488-BIU-
2016), meaning its water consumption, efficiency and 
management is tracked. 
Table 20: Water use of corporate operations
FY23 
(m3)
FY22

Total water consumed 474 202 208
All our headquarter offices are serviced by professional waste 
management operators that collect and recycle the waste 
stream in alignment with local recycling infrastructure. Our 
Amsterdam office benefits from the very high collection and 
recycling rates in the Netherlands.

are included in this year’s data, compared to only the 
Amsterdam office in previous years.

Our Classifieds segment is enabling a circular economy by enabling its customers to trade and thereby extending the useful lives 
of consumer products like clothing, laptops, and televisions. Consumers buying a pre-owned product forego on the need to 
manufacture and ship a new product, saving materials, water and GHG emissions in the process. OLX calculates the 
environmental impact of these transactions, calculating the avoided emissions, energy, materials and water.

Please note that comparability of impact across the years is limited. Every year OLX improves the methodology to be as accurate as 
possible about their impact. Changes in the methodology may be due to differences in countries in scope (due to organisational 
changes) or due to new categories being added. For FY22, OLX added very stringent methodology improvements specifically for the 
cars and motorcycles category. As this was the biggest category in terms of prevented impact, this resulted in lower prevented 
impact than the prior years. Please see the OLX Impact Report for more information.

Appendix: GHG inventory scope and boundaries
Reporting period covered Financial years 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023.
Our financial year runs from 1 April to 31 March.
Organisational boundary GHG accounting for scope 1 and 2 emissions includes assets and facilities that are owned 
or controlled by our organisation and have more than 10 employees. In some instances, we 
host employees from our portfolio companies at our owned or controlled office facilities. In 
this scenario, the employees will be included in the total emissions reporting for that 
specific facility. There is also the case that office facilities owned or controlled by our 
portfolio companies host some Naspers and Prosus corporate employees. In this scenario, 
their emissions will be reported within the boundaries of the portfolio company.
Operational boundary Scope 1: Direct emissions from owned/controlled operations. 
Scope 2: Indirect emissions from the use of purchased electricity, steam, heating, and 
cooling.
Scope 3: The result of activities from assets not owned or controlled by the reporting 
organisation, but that the organisation indirectly impacts in its value chain. The 
methodology, approach, and source of emission factors for the scope 3 categories are 
specified under each category in the following pages. 
The following scope 3 categories are material for Prosus:
Category 1 – Purchased goods and services
Category 2 – Capital goods
Category 3 – Fuel and energy-related activities
Category 4 – Upstream transportation and distribution
Category 5 – Waste generated in operations
Category 6 – Business travel
Category 7 – Employee commuting
Category 15 – Investments
Note: Category 8 – category 14 are not applicable for our corporate operations.
GHG accounting definitions and methodology
The formula below is used to convert activity data into 
emissions figures for all Prosus activities:
Activity data from fuel source x emission factor*  
= CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions
The following global warming potentials are used in 
calculation the CO2 equivalent emissions.

Scope 1: Direct emissions resulting from the use of fossil 
fuels and refrigerants for operations at owned or 
controlled assets and office facilities. Specific activities 
contributing to direct emissions are described below;
 » Mobile combustion: Fuels that are used in the 
operation of vehicles of other forms of mobile 
transportation that include gasoline, diesel, liquid 
petroleum gas (LPG), AdBlue and fuel oil. 
 » Stationary combustion: Fuels used for activities such as 
heating, and in the case of inhibited power supply, for 
generators to keep the operations going. These 
include natural gas, gasoline, diesel and LPG.
