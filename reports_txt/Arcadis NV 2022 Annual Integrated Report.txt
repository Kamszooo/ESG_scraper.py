Case | MOBILITY
 “ We’re proud to be part of the team pioneering the energy 
transition to a more sustainable world. It’s brilliant to see 
Shell leading the way with this initiative, providing EV 
drivers with an easy and rapid charging system. ”
Paul Hamer | Programme Director
How we are different
Environmental planning and removal of existing fuel infrastructure 
to transform a fuel station into an EV charging hub. 
Impact
The result is Shell’s first ever site to have converted from selling 
petrol and diesel to cater solely for electric vehicles, offering a 
glimpse into the future of mobility.

The
Challenge
The
Solution
The
Impact
Electric vehicle (EV) drivers are looking for a charging experience that is 
as fast, convenient and comfortable as possible. So, when it was time to 
transform Shell’s Service Station in Fulham in the UK into an EV charging 
hub, Arcadis stepped in to support with environmental planning and the 
removal of existing fuel infrastructure, helping to pave the way for the 
best solutions for EV drivers.
EV and battery technology is advancing rapidly. Today, charging speed 
is limited only by the batteries themselves, meaning that a 175 kW 
ultra-rapid charger will charge most vehicles up to 80% within 30 minutes, 
in ideal conditions. With more drivers now making the switch to electric 
vehicles, Arcadis supported Shell with the safe removal of old petrol and 
diesel infrastructure at its existing fuel station in Fulham, ahead of the 
installation of new charge points. The redeveloped station features a 
sustainable design including a timber canopy with built-in solar panels, 
as well as roof and shop windows that employ double glazing with high 
insulating properties. With the customer experience paramount, the hub 
includes a comfortable seating area, free Wi-Fi, a coffee shop and 
supermarket, ensuring drivers can enjoy a pleasant environment while 
recharging their vehicles. 
This is Shell’s first ever site to have converted from selling petrol and 
diesel to cater solely for electric vehicles, offering a glimpse into the 
future of mobility. Shell Fulham now features nine high-powered, 
ultra-rapid 175kW charge points, running on 100% certified renewable 
electricity. By increasing the availability of these faster charging points, 
drivers are assured of shorter charging times and ultimately can enjoy 
a quicker journey and improved customer experience.

Message from the Executive Board
Welcome to our 2022 Annual Integrated Report
The last 12 months have been foundational 
and pivotal for Arcadis. We are in a strong 
position, with healthy organic and profitable 
growth and record net revenue and backlog. 
We have made significant progress in delivering 
our strategic priorities by fully implementing 
our Global Business Area structure and 
strategically repositioning our business 
through the acquisition of exciting new 
companies. These successes position us for  
a positive start to 2023.
It would be remiss of me not to mention that 2022 has not been 
without challenges. We cannot forget the heart-breaking images 
of Ukrainians fleeing their homes following the illegal invasion by 
Russian armed forces in February, the extreme weather conditions 
across Europe, North America and Australia across the year and the 
subsequent impacts on the world economy. These events remind us 
of how fragile the world can be at times. At the same time, it was 
humbling to see how Arcadians responded to support others affected 
by crisis, particularly in Ukraine, where our ‘Ukraine Task Force’ put in 
extraordinary efforts to support people displaced and impacted by 
the conflict in Eastern Europe.
“ We have made great progress in delivering on our 
strategy, fully implemented our new Global Business 
Area structure, made exciting new business 
acquisitions and are truly becoming a digital leader 
across our industry. ”

Message from the Executive Board
“ Our three GBAs – Resilience, Places and 
Mobility – have been up and running for 
12 months. The new model is enabling 
us to share expertise and capabilities to 
better serve our clients, win new projects, 
and provide exciting opportunities for 
our people. ”
I am encouraged that despite the geo-political and economic 
uncertainty, national governments, public agencies and the private 
sector continue to invest. They recognize the need to tackle climate 
change and to address biodiversity loss to enable healthier lives, 
thriving nature, effortless transport, and more enjoyable places. 
The recent US Inflation Reduction Act, US and European CHIPS Acts 
and the REPowerEU energy plan in Europe are examples of 
investment packages where Arcadians are offering their expertise 
to create sustainable and digital solutions for our clients and the 
communities in which we operate.
Delivering our targets through focus and scale
With megatrends like urbanization, climate change, digitalization 
and growing societal expectations shaping the needs of our clients, 
I am pleased to report we continued to make great strides to deliver 
our ‘Maximizing Impact’ strategic targets in 2022. 
The Global Business Areas (GBAs)
Our three GBAs – Resilience, Places and Mobility – have been up 
and running for 12 months. The new model is enabling us to share 
expertise and capabilities to better serve our clients, win new 
projects, and provide exciting opportunities for our people.
We have also started to see better cross-GBA collaboration. 
For example, in our Places and Mobility businesses we have seen 
close collaboration to grow our industrial manufacturing expertise, 
particularly around the building of gigafactories to support battery 
production and the rollout of electric vehicles. 
The rapidly changing geopolitical conditions and resulting client 
demands have caused my leadership team to even more closely 
than before review opportunities and investments to help accelerate 
impact for our people, clients, shareholders and crucially future proof 
our business. 
Strategic acquisitions and divestments 
As a result of this review, in July we announced the acquisition of 
Canadian headquartered IBI Group, a forward thinking, technology-
driven design firm. This was followed in October by the announced 
acquisition of DPS Group, a full-service consultancy in the high 
growth and resilient life sciences and semiconductor manufacturing 
sectors. Both strategic acquisitions will grow our talent to 35,617 
people globally, strengthen Arcadis’ position in North America and 
Europe, drive growth of our combined solutions and help to focus 
and scale our operating model. This has also led to the creation of 
a fourth GBA – Intelligence – and an enhanced architecture and 
urbanism offering within the Places GBA in 2023. 
We were also pleased to welcome HydroNET, a provider of intelligent 
water solutions, and Giftge Consult, a leading player in the German 
energy transition market to the Arcadis family in 2022. 
In line with our strategic targets to focus on growth markets and 
scale our GBA services and solutions, we also took the decision to 
divest and withdraw from several smaller countries in Europe and 
Southeast Asia in 2022.

Message from the Executive Board
“ Arcadis has been pioneering solutions to 
protect, restore and improve our planet 
for as long as we have been in existence. ”
Sustainability remains at the core of everything we do
Addressing climate change and biodiversity loss are the greatest 
challenges of our generation and we need to play our part. As a member 
of the United Nations Global Compact, we consider it a moral obligation 
and an opportunity to develop smarter, cleaner, and greener solutions 
for our clients and communities. We have committed to being a leader 
in our sector; challenging norms, embracing innovation, collaborating 
with the best and pushing boundaries to solve this challenge.
This is not new for Arcadis. As a responsible business, we have been 
pioneering solutions to protect, restore and improve our planet for 
as long as we have been in existence. Whether it is our long-standing 
expertise in supporting the transition to renewable energy sources 
in the Netherlands and Germany or more recently pioneering nature-
based solutions to protect and ‘green’ the cities of Rotterdam and Paris, 
sustainable solutions are in our DNA. 
Furthermore, the recent number one position in our industry by ratings 
agency Sustainalytics and ‘Platinum’ grading from EcoVadis show that 
our commitment and drive around sustainability continue to be world 
leading. Yet, like all businesses, we can’t be complacent. We must be 
more ambitious and continue to play our leading role in accelerating 
the transition to a net zero world for our clients. 
This year, we have begun to embed our Sustainability Advisory into 
our operations and client solutions. The Sustainability Advisory brings 
together experts from around the world and is now operational in 
eight countries, helping to develop comprehensive strategies for our 
clients. Together with our solutions leaders, we now provide integrated 
end-to-end sustainable solutions at scale. Whether devising a plan to 
decarbonize buildings in the City of London, designing a coastal flood 
management system to stop Battery Park and Lower Manhattan being 
deluged by water, or helping to accelerate the rollout of electric bus 
fleets in Australia, Arcadians are on hand to help.   
In the debate around sustainability, it is crucial we don’t forget about 
people and recognize growing inequality and further increased societal 
expectations. This year, I was proud to continue to play an active role 
on the Business Commission to Tackle Inequality, a coalition of 
organizations within the World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development (WBCSD), with the mission of mobilizing the private 
sector to tackle inequality and generate shared prosperity. This is a 
topical issue for our clients and one we also reflected in our 2022 
Sustainable Cities Index. The award-winning report ranks 100 global 
cities across three sustainability pillars of Planet, People and Profit to 
evaluate their overall prosperity and outlines steps that authorities can 
take to improve quality of life for inhabitants. 
Within Arcadis, we have also made strides to embed diversity, equity, 
inclusion and belonging into our operations, a renewed commitment 
to hybrid working and the launch of global affinity groups to champion 
inclusion and diversity. Our progress has been recognized by Forbes 
magazine, which not only ranked Arcadis as one of the best 
management consultancy firms, but one of the world’s top female 
friendly companies in 2022. Great achievements that we plan to build 
on next year. 
There is no easy fix to solve urgent issues like growing inequality, the 
climate crisis, and biodiversity loss, but through greater leadership, 
innovation and collaboration, I believe the sectors in which we operate 
can help make a difference.  
Driving digital leadership and growth
Reliance on technology and data has continued to grow, and our 
clients’ appetite to innovate and digitize their solutions shows no 
signs of slowing. At Arcadis, we have been investing in digital skills 
and empowering our people to create digital solutions to meet our 
clients’ greatest challenges. To support these ambitions, in 2022 
we transitioned most of our IT infrastructure to the cloud (both 
networking and hosting) which will further increase the scalability 
of our client solutions.
This year, I am pleased to see the emergence of new digital products, 
including our innovative AI-solution called Transport Strategy Optimizer. 
The product will help our mobility clients to identify and prioritize their 
investments while allowing a more transparent and collaborative 
decision-making process. Meanwhile mature digital solutions like 
FieldNow – an onsite data collection tool - continue to grow from 
strength to strength, with over 100 new commissions in 2022.  
The delivery of digital services and products has been further 
enhanced through the creation of the Intelligence GBA. The new 
GBA will bring together the best of IBI’s Intelligence business and 
Arcadis Gen to provide clients with innovative, technology-enabled 
solutions, meeting our ambition to be a digital leader in our industry.

Message from the Executive Board
Looking to the future
Our healthy organic growth, solid margins and a strong balance sheet 
throughout 2022 have enabled us to invest in our future and create 
new and exciting solutions for our clients. This is reflected not only by 
the growth but by our improved client satisfaction feedback and net 
promoter score, which has increased by five points in 2022 to 30. 
Investment in our people and solutions combined with increased 
funding from both public and private sector clients in growth areas 
such as smart mobility, energy transition and climate adaptation will 
serve us well in 2023. 
With the integration of a new architecture and urbanism division 
within our GBA Places and the creation of the fourth GBA intelligence, 
we have a unique opportunity to better serve our clients with new 
sustainable and digital solutions. 
To conclude, I would like to thank my fellow Arcadians. Through the 
combined power of 35,617 global colleagues, we can really add value 
to our clients, make a positive impact on society and ensure a 
promising and sustainable future for Arcadis. 
Our Supervisory Board and shareholders have continued to offer 
their support and counsel throughout 2022, which I have greatly 
appreciated, and I thank our clients for their loyalty and 
encouragement to develop new solutions to their problems. 
Lastly, this will be my final annual report. I plan to retire at our annual 
General Meeting in May to spend more time with my family. Pending 
approval by our shareholders, I will hand the baton over to Alan 
Brookes, our Chief Operating Officer, who brings significant 
international leadership experience, a strong strategic, commercial 
and operational background, and a deep understanding of Arcadis. 
It has been my honor and privilege to lead Arcadis over the last six 
years. It has been challenging at times, but the business is on a strong 
and healthy footing, well on its way to delivering its strategic targets 
and accelerating its impact in 2023.

Message from the Chair
Arcadis continued to deliver healthy organic growth with a robust 
operating performance in 2022. The company’s new operating model, 
structured around its Global Business Areas (GBAs), is yielding the 
expected results as a catalyst for growth. It helps leverage the global 
scale of the company’s capabilities through increased global 
collaboration and enables Arcadis to better serve the changing 
needs of clients around the world. 
In 2022, the Supervisory Board was closely involved in and fully 
supported the acquisitions of IBI Group, DPS Group, HydroNET and 
Giftge Consult which, together with the divestment of certain non-
core operations, have rebalanced the company’s geographic and 
business portfolio. These transformational steps repositioned 
Arcadis towards high growth and resilient markets in Europe 
and North America.
Looking ahead, 2023 is the delivery year for the goals set out in the 
‘Maximizing Impact’ strategy and I am confident in the company’s 
ability to deliver. The Supervisory Board’s focus areas in 2023 will 
include embedding the recent acquisitions and shaping the newly 
created fourth GBA – Intelligence. The Supervisory Board is excited 
about the opportunities that lie ahead for Arcadis to create 
innovative, sustainable and digital solutions for clients and 
communities around the world. 
The Supervisory Board has accepted the wish of our CEO, 
Peter Oosterveer to step back as of the upcoming AGM in May 2023. 
We are immensely grateful for his leadership in bringing Arcadis to 
the strong and resilient position it is currently in. This is a completely 
different reality than the one Peter started from in 2017. We will 
miss him as a strong business leader with a keen eye for people and 
culture. It has been a great pleasure to work with Peter. We have an 
outstanding internal candidate to succeed him as CEO, and are fully 
confident that Alan Brookes, our current Chief Operating Officer, 
following approval by the AGM, will be able to successfully lead 
Arcadis into the coming years. The Supervisory Board will be working 
closely with both Peter and Alan to ensure a seamless transition.
At the annual General Meeting in 2023, we will be saying goodbye 
to two Supervisory Board members. Niek Hoek joined the board in 
2013 and served as its chair from 2015 to 2022. After 10 years of 
membership, he is not standing for another two-year term. The board 
has benefited greatly from his sage and inclusive leadership style. 
Wee Gee Ang joined the board in 2017 and was re-elected for another 
four-year term in 2021. He is retiring mid-term to focus on his 
interests in Asia. We thank both gentlemen for their contributions 
to our Supervisory Board.
The past year has again shown the importance of discipline and focus 
in creating long-term, sustainable value for all stakeholders. Thanks 
to the remarkable talent, commitment and resilience demonstrated 
by Arcadians around the globe, the company can look back on yet 
another strong year and look to the future with confidence. 
On behalf of the Supervisory Board of Arcadis NV
Michiel Lap  
 
“We have made significant 
progress towards achieving 
our strategic targets. ”
Stellar performance in 2022 and a confident outlook 
Priorities for the Supervisory Board in 2022
The Supervisory Board, in coordination with the Executive Board and 
the Executive Leadership Team, identified and put special emphasis 
on the following Supervisory Board Priorities in 2022:
1. Contain and improve attrition 
2.  Institutionalize the GBA Operating Model and deliver on 2022 plan
3. Maintain confidence of investor base 
4.  Further improve performance of CRTKL, for integration of 
architectural business into Places GBA
5.  Maintain momentum on ESG, including deployment of detailed 
net zero roadmap and implementation of non-financial reporting
6. Deploy M&A strategy aligned with GBA strategy and goals
7. Succession planning 
Of course, the health and safety of our people and the past year’s 
geo-political and economic instability and its impact on Arcadis, its 
people and its performance were also a top priority in 2022.

Our position in the industry value chain
Arcadis is a full-service design, engineering, and consultancy organization. Our work 
spans the entire asset lifecycle. We consult for the full length of projects, even 
assisting clients with their investment programs, rather than just individual projects. 
Digital components are built into our solutions to allow asset performance control

We know our industry sectors well and share that knowledge globally to provide best-in-class sustainable 
solutions to our clients, wherever they are located. We cover the entire lifecycle but can also add value to 
clients in each individual phase of projects, working with partners and (sub)contractors to deliver complex 
projects on time and within budget. 
We approach our clients’ complex challenges with a carefully chosen combination of deep technical 
insights, solid business consulting skills, strong management capabilities, digital proficiency, and 
sustainable prowess. By bringing digital capabilities to projects we provide our clients more transparency 
and efficiency and better user experience insights in the conceptual phase of projects, enhanced control 
during a project’s realization, and better insights into an asset’s performance during its economic lifespan.
Increasingly, sustainability is a key to getting projects funded, accepted by society and to win work. It can 
bring benefits like pricing power, cost reductions, a stronger labor market position, business opportunities 
for new products and services as well as a reduction in risks and better access to capital. Sustainability is 
therefore a design principle when we develop our solutions for clients. Through our client solutions we are 
committed to contribute to the sustainable development agenda and have a positive impact on society, 
the people, and communities we serve.

How we are different
Working in partnership on an area-based approach to finding 
solutions for present day challenges around water management, 
nature and agriculture. 
Impact
By restoring water levels and preventing further environmental 
degradation, heritage estates can flourish, bringing both 
environmental and economic benefits to the region.

heritage sites 
The
Challenge
The
Solution
The
Impact
The Baakse Beek region is home to a large concentration of listed 
monuments and heritage sites, including castles, country houses and 
estates, many of which date back to Medieval times. These have an 
important role in shaping the cultural identity of the area, supporting the 
livelihoods of tenant farmers and bringing economic benefits through 
tourism. However, thanks to the impact of climate change, long periods 
of drought and occasional heavy rainfall are starting to take their toll. 
The built environment needs to adapt, but how can new climate 
adaptation measures best be embedded in these historically 
valuable landscapes? 
To halt weather-related environmental degradation, the Ministry of 
Education, Culture and Science has given local authorities and civil society 
organizations scope to improve water levels on green heritage sites. As part 
of a pilot, the Province of Gelderland is working with the Rijn en IJssel Water 
Board, the municipality of Bronckhorst and estate owners to improve water 
management. Key is exploring how underground moisture levels can be 
managed and retained after heavy rainfall, so that more benefit can be 
derived in times of drought. We are contributing project management, 
landscape architecture and other specialist technical expertise, conducting 
early water system analysis, creating preliminary designs and hydrological 
calculations, making environmental management recommendations for 
maintaining soil biodiversity, as well as design and technical 
implementation of water management solutions. 
By restoring water levels, heritage estates can flourish, in turn bringing 
both environmental and economic benefits to the region. Further, the 
knowledge and experience gained during this pilot program will be used 
to benefit similar projects and support the development of government 
policy for the restoration of nature on green heritage sites. In the long 
term, this will create an integrated solution that takes into account the 
interests and expertise of all parties involved and makes an important 
contribution to the climate challenge.

Making Progress on our ‘Maximizing Impact’ strategy
* Global Excellence Centers Leading 
Our strategy amplifies the role of our organization as a positive force in society. Since launching in 2021, we have advanced 
our commitments in the following ways. 
• Acquisition of IBI Group in part serves as a digital accelerator, shaping the fourth GBA: 
“Intelligence”
• Investing in new digital solutions, such HydroNet and the Transportation Strategy 
Optimizer
• Driving standardization & automation of solutions to provide greater value to clients
• Strengthening our position in digital advisory, to support clients in their journey to 
transform
Digital leadership
• Acquisition of Giftge Consult strengthening further our position in the energy 
transition market
• Acquisition of DPS strengthening further our position in sustainable manufacturing – 
particularly Life Sciences and Chip Manufacturing
• Expanding our strength in strategic consultancy for sustainability across ESG strategy 
& reporting, resource optimization and value chain engagement
 Sustainability
• Focus on high growth end markets and geographical core markets and divesting  
non-core geographies and businesses
• GBA structure and Global Excellence Centers driving client focus, operational 
efficiencies and consistency in data management
• Strengthening of our market position in North America and UK/Europe through  
our acquisitions
Focus and scale
GBA model fully operational
Effective from 1 January 2022 our Global Business Areas/ GBAs (Resilience, Places and Mobility) became 
the home of our previous regional business lines and solutions. We are already seeing growth in 
knowledge exchange around the world, with our clients benefitting from our collective best practices. 
Following the successful completion of the IBI Group acquisition in September, we also established our 
fourth GBA – Intelligence. The new GBA combines the best of IBI Group’s Intelligence segment and 
Arcadis Gen to create an attractive suite of data driven products and solutions to meet the ever-changing 
priorities of our clients. 
Strategic repositioning achieved
The implementation of our global operating model proved to be successful over 2022 and accelerated 
the pace of organic growth in the current market environment. In addition, our strategic acquisitions of 
HydroNet (digital water), IBI Group (sustainable & digital/intelligent urbanism), Giftge Consult (energy 
transition) and DPS (sustainable manufacturing), strengthen our position in the market. Finally, we have 
driven operational efficiencies through the new GBA model and greater use of GECs, and by divesting 
operations that did not fit our priorities. The benefits this progress has delivered can be seen in the 
growing client demand for our digital products and sustainable solutions, highlighted by strong results 
and a record backlog.

Market Dynamics and client opportunities
• Increased shift towards a low-carbon, green and equitable economy. 
The acceleration and unpredictability of weather events and the 
latest IPCC reports have signaled a global climate emergency.
• Sharp increase in clients demand for renewables or low carbon 
energy, making climate adaptation a priority, and rethinking 
infrastructure and global supply chains.
• Key drivers of the Environmental services market remain: 
energy transition, sustainability, emerging contaminants, 
and climate change. 
The impacts of these trends have also put a focus on a just and 
equitable transition, as highlighted at COP27. Societal pressure brings 
topics of affordability and social equity to the top of the agenda in 
many of the markets we are active in. This is a key area of focus for 
Arcadis as we strive to improve quality of life in the communities we 
operate. With so much change, the use of data to aid credible 
decision making and drive actions has also fueled the need for 
greater digitalization, signaling the need to act faster. 
The Resilience GBA is well placed to address the opportunities we 
see. Since our launch in 2021, key actions have been taken including 
identifying, launching and growing solutions. We have focused 
investments in embedding sustainability, driving innovation and 
scaling the best of what we do across our geographies.
• Recruitment and retention have been a key focus to ensure we 
are delivering on our growth ambitions and client commitments. 
Over 2,300 Arcadians have been hired in Resilience over the 
12-month period. 
• We continue investing in areas where we have a unique advantage 
as ‘proven pioneers’:
 – Energy transition in Europe, the United Kingdom and the U.S.
 – Leveraging PFAS expertise from 1,000 sites across the globe, 
with significant engagement in the U.S. and Europe, and growth 
in Brazil, Canada and Australia.
 – Focusing on climate adaptation and the growing market for 
nature-based solutions and biodiversity in Europe, especially 
the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Australia and the U.S.
 – Growing our global Sustainability Advisory (over 200 experts) 
and Energy Transition (over 360 experts) practices to accelerate 
our clients’ ambitions.
 – Expanding our technical expertise and asset knowledge to 
support clients with strategic front-end advice through our 
Advisory, including Digital Advisory, Business Transformation and 
Sustainability Advisory, with over 600 experts across the globe. 
 – Growing our portfolio and capabilities through strategic 
acquisitions in water and energy transition. Arcadis acquired a 
70% stake in Water Platform Company, parent company for 
HydroNET, an intelligent digital platform that provides real time 
data to manage water systems through periods of drought, heavy 
rainfall and other extreme events. Plus Giftge Consult, a leading 
consulting company, strengthening our Energy Transition 
position with key German transport infrastructure, hydrogen and 
energy transmission system operators.

Market conditions continue to be strong, especially in North America 
and Europe with the energy transition, demand for sustainable 
solutions and climate adaptation high on the agenda. Water clients 
shift their focus from capital investment to operational efficiencies, 
increasing the attractivity of our digital product offering. 
Environmental restoration services including PFAS are in high 
demand, particularly as the regulatory environment expands to more 
sectors. 
Various key clients are increasingly looking for strategic sustainability 
advisory in combination with engineering solutions, Arcadis 
Sustainability Advisory addresses this demand and grew to over 200 
FTE since it was founded in 2021. Furthermore, the ageing energy 
asset base in Europe and the transition to renewables is generating 
opportunities for our teams to demonstrate the full range of 
capabilities, from decommissioning to the planning and consent of 
new developments.

Case | RESILIENCE
 “ Grid modernization and expansion is key in meeting the Netherlands’ 
future green energy ambitions. But we also need to reduce wastage 
and optimize how we use our existing infrastructure to keep up with 
current needs. ”
 Frank Goossensen | Sales Director Resilience
How we are different
We have developed an innovative system using compressed air to 
store surplus renewable energy in redundant natural gas plants 
and infrastructure.
Impact
Useful, clean energy can be reclaimed when it would otherwise be 
wasted, and legacy fossil fuel production sites are finding a new 
purpose and becoming a valuable part of the journey to net-zero.

of otherwise wasted renewable energy retained for future use
Redevelopment of natural gas plants and 
infrastructure for renewable energy storage
eCATS application, Netherlands
The
Challenge
The
Solution
The
Impact
Natural gas production fields onshore in The Netherlands are in decline 
and, over the course of the next decade, will reach the end of their field 
life. Instead, more sustainable renewable energy sources like wind and 
solar power are fulfilling a growing proportion of the country’s total 
energy needs. However, during the day when energy requirements are 
often at their highest there can be an imbalance between supply and 
demand, causing grid congestion that could result in a loss of supply. 
Meanwhile, because the gas fields will soon stop production, their 
locations and related infrastructure are becoming redundant. This leaves 
us with a question: is there an opportunity to create a more independent 
renewable energy system by using the redundant gas infrastructure? 
Arcadis has created a Compressed Air Transport and Storage System, 
known as eCATS. It uses redundant natural gas infrastructure to store 
renewable energy in cases of grid congestion - which occurs when 
transmission facilities do not have sufficient capacity to deliver the energy 
required - and restore this energy when needed. Compressing surplus 
renewable energy into air and storing it in out-of-use natural gas pipelines 
not only reduces grid congestion but means that this energy can be 
released later via Expanders. This compressed air energy solution has a 
wide range of applications. Alongside the main characteristic of eCATS 
being to support energy transition and grid stabilization, this solution 
can also be used to support district heating or the provision of cold air for 
ambient conditioning or cooling. In this way, the degree of utilization can 
be increased by up to 95%. 
eCATS solves the problem of wasted surplus renewable energy, while 
maintaining the value of natural gas infrastructure; benefiting multiple 
parties, and solving multiple problems. Useful, clean energy can be 
reclaimed when it would otherwise be wasted, and the legacy sites 
of fossil fuel production are finding a new purpose and becoming a 
valuable part of the journey to reduce our reliance on climate-harming 
energy production. 
Arcadis and Emmett Green own the eCATS solution and are exploring this 
innovative concept with Siemens Energy as the preferred engineer and 
supplier of an eCATS-facility in the province of Drenthe. This will have a 
60MWh capacity, which would far outstrip The Netherlands’ current 
largest of 25MWh. By storing this energy, the country can continue to 
increase the proportion of power it uses from renewable sources.

Market dynamics and client opportunities
• Growth in Industrial Manufacturing as clients look for high-speed 
turnaround for project delivery with integrated service offerings. 
Increased demand for automotive gigafactories for electric 
vehicles, specialist semiconductor manufacturing facilities, life 
sciences (pharmaceutical) facilities, and data centres. Government-
backed initiatives such as the CHIPS and Sciences Act in the US 
and European Chips Act both signal continued investment in 
semiconductor research, development and manufacturing. Meeting 
these opportunities in resilient markets has informed Arcadis’ M&A 
activity, most notably the acquisition of DPS Group.
• Government and Public Agencies show continued growth, notably 
in Healthcare. Initiatives such as the UK’s New Hospitals 
Programme, with a commitment to build 40 new hospitals by 2030, 
is representative of continued investment to address aging 
infrastructure. Investment is echoed in other countries, such as 
Australia, where Arcadis is delivering a cost management office 
through its digital ‘Cost Clarity’ platform to a major state building 
authority. The acquisition of IBI Group – coupled with the expertise 
of CRTKL through Arcadis’ Architecture and Urbanism division – 
brings new capabilities and scale to support clients in this sector.
• Property and Investment continues to show effects from the 
pandemic, with significant changes in how – and how often – people 
use residential and corporate real estate. Inflationary pressures, 
scarcity of materials and skills in the construction industry (as 
illustrated in the Arcadis International Construction Costs report) 
continue to impact cost and spending decisions. As investors look 
to maximize returns, solutions such as PlaceTech – alongside 
Arcadis’ core services such as Cost & Commercial Management and 
Project & Program Management – can help inform decision making 
and deliver a return on investment. 
• Supporting emission-free mobility, we continue to make significant 
contributions in the development of gigafactories. A salient 
example is our work with a high-end EV manufacturer, developing 
their first EV plant by providing design and project assurance. This 
brings our GBA model to life with experts coming together in 
collaboration from North America, the Netherlands and UK to 
provide a seamless experience for the client. This ability and agility, 
connecting our people with each other and with clients, wherever 
they’re located, is a key strength for us as we move forwards. We’re 
seeing growth also in Europe, with our team now fully engaged 
with a client in Sweden, and we have recently been successful in 
securing an agreement with ACC to deliver a new gigafactory 
facility in Kaiserslautern, Germany.
Financial pressures are not the only concern for clients, with 
environmental pressures also informing decision making and 
investments. The need to better manage embodied and operational 
carbon from built assets to meet net zero commitments and ESG 
goals has increased demand for sustainability advisory, and design 
and engineering solutions. Arcadis’ Net Zero Facilities and 
Sustainable Communities solution has been implemented across the 
public and private sector to support this trend – through both new 
developments and retrofit projects.

Places has undergone significant strategic repositioning during 2022. 
The strategic objective to increase exposure to high growth markets 
combined with addressing the strong demand from clients for 
integrated offering led to the complementary acquisitions of IBI 
Group and DPS Group. Increased focus on core profitable activities 
and scalable geographies resulted in the divestment of operations in 
mostly Southeast Asia. China was impacted by the property freeze 
causing delay in projects, increasing further our selectivity on bids 
and new orders. Furthermore, the Architecture & Urbanism Business 
Unit was set up into Places, bringing together former IBI Group and 
CallisonRTKL architects under the same roof.

Revenue growth was driven from good demand for sustainable and 
intelligent buildings, including the development of datacenters and 
gigafactories for electric vehicle battery production. Order intake and 
growth from European and US clients, particularly from investments 
in industrial manufacturing facilities was strong. This was offset by 
delayed investment decisions from several Property & Investment 
sector clients in Asia, validating our decision to strategically 
reposition the portfolio. 
The operating EBITA margin improved to 9.1%, as operating 
performance improved year-on-year and as the Places GBA started to 
really benefit in Q4 from the geographic repositioning. partly driven 
by our decision to exit countries that were performing below Places 
GBA level. 
The total backlog of the Places increased by 67% year-on-year to 
€1,573 million, representing 50% of Arcadis’ total backlog and 
inclusive of €308 million backlog from IBI Group and €460 million

How we are different
Arcadis utilized global expertise to execute this project 
speed-to-market and with sustainability deeply embedded 
in the design-build.
Impact
By opening a manufacturing facility in the U.S., Wallbox will be 
able to sustainably supply a significant portion of the charging 
units needed to support the country’s charging infrastructure.
250,000
EV chargers produced in 2022
The
Challenge
The
Solution
The
Impact
Widespread electric vehicle (EV) adoption in the United States will play a 
key role in improving air quality and achieving net zero emissions by 2050. 
While EV sales have steadily increased in the past few years, the U.S. 
currently lacks the charging infrastructure needed to support the 
transition. The country is expected to require 1.7 million EV charging 
stations by 2030, though there are just 47,000 available today. Wallbox, 
a global electric vehicle charging and energy management provider, 
partnered with Arcadis to build its first U.S.-based charger manufacturing 
facility in Arlington, Texas to help close this gap.
To meet the needs of the U.S. ’s growing EV market, design and 
construction for the facility began as quickly as possible, with construction 
split into two phases. The Arcadis team worked closely with procurement 
experts to plan for equipment and materials with long lead times and with 
local authorities to obtain permits without delay. The team utilized Open 
Space to make the project more accessible to team members from other 
locations, which allowed for quicker decision making, and phase one was 
completed ahead of schedule, allowing Wallbox to begin manufacturing 
EV charger units earlier than expected. The team also took several 
measures to minimize the facility’s carbon footprint where possible, 
such as retrofitting an existing facility, using highly recyclable content 
and energy efficiency LED lighting, specialized ventilation and filtration 
controls for improved indoor air quality, and more. 
The completed manufacturing facility is now on track to produce 250,000 
charging units by the end of its first few months, with the expectation that 
it will create over 500,000 units each year, as well as 250 green jobs in 
Arlington, by 2025. Wallbox’s UL chargers are compatible with all electric 
vehicles, making them widely available for EV drivers across the U.S. 
While the United States’ climate goals can feel abstract, Wallbox is helping 
create the charging infrastructure needed to make the electric vehicle 
transition a reality. 
Case | PLACES
 “ EVs will soon be a fixture of everyday life, and creating the 
facilities to help accelerate adoption and implementation all 
around the world will be crucial when it comes to addressing 
concerns around long-term carbon emissions. ”

Market dynamics and client opportunities
Mobility infrastructure remains an essential investment for countries 
to help stimulate their economies, progress the sustainability agenda 
and drive social equity. This ESG focus has provided growth for 
Arcadis, where we’ve seen Governments significantly increase their 
investment in public transport, maintenance of infrastructure and 
sustainable mobility solutions, such as Electric Vehicles. This has 
been most notable in the US, driven by the Biden Administration’s 
Infrastructure Law, and Arcadis is working with our US State 
Government clients to deliver many large infrastructure projects. 
• Asset Management of ageing infrastructure continues to be a 
growing agenda for developed countries and design and build 
remains a large part of our business. 
• Rail, as we’ve seen in previous years is the transport mode of 
choice for developed countries, particularly as a solution for clean 
and accessible transport. 
• For our highways clients around the world, safety and social equity 
is a key driver. 
• Some Governments struggled to deliver throughout 2022 due to 
supply chain issues, as a result they’re looking for new procurement 
models to assist with this ongoing challenge. 
• The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has made 
significant revisions to the GHG strategy for the shipping industry. 
With strong expertise in port development, energy transition, and 
climate change, Arcadis will be key to supporting the global GHG 
ambition for the shipping industry.
• New Mobility is a fast growing and increasingly sought-after 
capability as Governments around the world implement vehicle 
emissions targets and electric vehicle policies.

Market conditions remain strong in the mobility and infrastructure 
sector, with ongoing programs and stimulus packages continuing to 
drive a solid demand. Decarbonization and climate change remain a 
high priority. Committed funding in the US, ageing infrastructure in 
Australia and UK investments in rail and road upgrades has led to 
significant order intake on large projects. 
Integrated Airports expected to fuel a series of opportunities mainly 
in North America, but also a number of greenfield opportunities in 
Europe. 
The operating EBITA margin decrease versus last year was driven by 
increased investments in digital solutions and talent attraction and 
development. 
At the end of the year, the backlog in the Mobility GBA amounted to 
€538 million, representing 17% of Arcadis’ total backlog. IBI Group’s 
backlog of €41 million was included. We see further rail opportunities 
in Canada where we can now take a combined offering to clients, 
including station design and program management.

John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) is one of the busiest airports 
in the USA. It’s an indispensable part of global travel and the region’s 
economy. The airport handles nearly 62 million passengers a year and 
supports 280,000 jobs. The completion of the JFK Terminal 8 expansion 
marks the beginning of the JFK “Vision Plan” to transform it into a leading 
global airport, accommodating dramatic expected growth. The Vision 
Plan will be completed through a staged approach and provides a 
strategic framework for the Port Authority and its partners to completely 
redevelop, modify and expand existing facilities and infrastructure. 
During the JFK Terminal 8 project, Arcadis was embedded with the Port 
Authority of New York New Jersey’s (PANYNJ) Construction Management 
Division, providing program and construction management expertise 
across a wide range of disciplines, and project oversight of the 
redevelopment and refurbishment work being performed across the 
terminal. Operational enhancements included five new widebody gates, 
four new widebody parking positions, and an expanded and upgraded 
baggage handling system that will support additional transatlantic flights. 
The terminal has also been expanded with approximately 130,000 square 
feet of additional and refurbished space. The $400 million expansion and 
modernization will allow British Airways to move from its long-time home 
in Terminal 7 and co-locate with American Airlines in Terminal 8. 
The transformed JFK will provide an outstanding world-class passenger 
experience in-line with its famous location. The airport will boast 
optimized land and airspace use, expanded economic opportunities 
for the Borough of Queens and the region, and continued economic 
development through job creation, and environmental stewardship of 
local wildlife and preservation of recreation.

Market Dynamics and client opportunities
In 2021, society generated 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every day, and the 
reliance on technology and data continues to grow exponentially. Our 
client’s appetite to innovate and digitalize their solutions to improve the 
customer experience shows no signs of slowing. Clients, including TfL and 
the City of Toronto, want to respond to operational issues quickly, and 
efficiently optimise their assets. Their customers want a meaningful user 
experience and real time information at their fingertips, anytime and 
anywhere. 
Moving to SaaS solutions and products and then promoting and selling 
them across Resilience, Places and Mobility GBAs, will allow us to expand 
the number of clients we engage with in those markets. In the US alone 
there are some 50,000 water companies, we estimate that c.10,000 of 
those could benefit from our products and solutions over time.
As market and customer demands for digital solutions, advanced analytics 
and SaaS grow, our Intelligence GBA will be a clear differentiator. It will be 
the cornerstone of our ability to accelerate growth, expand margins and 
increase revenue. With new talent and scalable software solutions, 
particularly in water management and mobility, such as tolling, traffic 
management and traveller information, we have the ability and expertise 
to meet the ever-changing needs of our clients and grow our business.

Solution
The
Impact
The International and Blue Water bridges connect critical roadways 
linking Canada and the United States. Previous toll systems had not been 
upgraded for 10 years and, with up to 250,000 crossings every month, 
increasing international traffic and ongoing operational and maintenance 
needs were starting to have an impact. Residents, businesses travelers, 
haulers, and visitors on both sides of the border were often subject to 
delays and it was becoming increasingly clear that improvements needed 
to be made to help ease traffic flow. 
Arcadis IBI Group was contracted by the Michigan Department of 
Transportation (MDOT), the International Bridge Administration and 
the Federal Bridge Corporation Limited for the modernization of the 
existing toll system infrastructure of the two bridges. Working as part 
of a bi-national project team of US-Canadian stakeholders, Arcadis IBI 
acted as lead contractor to deliver its integrated toll system product, 
with services including system design, development, installation, testing, 
implementation, and project management. Operating on both sides 
of the border, Arcadis IBI’s toll system offers an enhanced transaction 
management and analytics platform, including trend analysis, 
performance monitoring, live monitoring and management of assets, 
transaction and revenue reconciliation, and auditing.
Arcadis IBI’s integrated toll system product offers an auditable and 
seamless solution for back and front-end operations, and can accommodate 
multiple currencies. Automated Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) 
tag reading has replaced the old card-based system, with greater 
interoperability and standardized web access allowing citizens to create 
accounts with multiple bridge agencies. New web portals were designed 
for increased reliability and functionality, improving customer experience 
by enabling people to manage their accounts more effectively, including 
via mobile apps. The toll system is being used successfully on both sides of 
the Blue Water Bridge, as well as on the US side of the International Bridge. 
Together, the application of this technology at all three locations has 
enabled total savings of 36 percent on upfront costs, with projected savings 
of $6.5 - $7 million over the next decade.

Stakeholder dialogue
In 2022, we focused on strengthening our responses to our 
prioritized material themes. We engaged with internal and 
external stakeholders to maximize our impact. For the first 
time we conducted a double materiality assessment in which 
we look outward-in, as well as inward-out.
Looking both ways: double impact considered  
as a new forward looking input
Stakeholder engagement is a necessary element of a comprehensive strategic approach. Targeted 
stakeholder engagement explores perceptions about the materiality of specific environmental, 
social and governance (ESG) issues to Arcadis and demonstrates a willingness to incorporate 
the viewpoints of external as well as internal stakeholders in Arcadis’ strategic planning. 
To embed sustainability in all we do, our nine material themes identified in the comprehensive materiality 
assessment in 2020 were an important guide. Arcadis updates its materiality assessment every two years 
while keeping in touch with stakeholders continuously to identify trends and market expectations, 
acknowledging that materiality is dynamic, rather than static. The continuous interaction includes 
programs like ‘Your Voice’ and ‘Grow Perform Succeed’ for our own people and ‘Client Experience’ for 
key clients. In addition, we have a dedicated team managing our relationships with shareholders and 
investors, who also support our Treasury team in maintaining relations with our lenders. Via specialized 
teams, we maintain contact with suppliers, NGOs and with organizations focusing on improving the 
sustainable performance of business in general, such as the World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development and FIDIC. We monitor developments in European legislation through EFRAG on 
the EU sustainability reporting standards, and progress of IFRS Foundation Trustees and revisions 
in reporting frameworks such as GRI. In line with new developments from GRI and EFRAG we 
performed our first double materiality assessment at the end of 2022 together with our stakeholders.

Stakeholder dialogue
• Topics in the Prioritize quadrant will get additional attention and where appropriate, funding so 
we can sufficiently address stakeholder expectations in these areas. Progress will be assessed 
in consultation with stakeholders who identified these topics as material to confirm alignment.
• Topics in the Control and Improve quadrant can lead to concerns if unaddressed. We have dedicated 
teams already responsible for these areas and the outcome of this analysis provides additional 
guidance for their activities, some of which has already been incorporated. Additional incremental 
improvements in these areas represent opportunities for Arcadis. 
• Topics identified in the other two quadrants will remain part of business-as-usual activities.
Material themes
In this report, we are disclosing on 2022 material topics and list them and the alignment with GRI, and 
note that the materiality matrix on page 46 reflects the updated materiality assessment completed in 
December 2022 to align with latest GRI standards and CRSD. We aim to update our disclosures on those 
material topics in the 2023 report. Based on the materiality assessment, Arcadis has decided to reduce its 
number of material themes from nine to four. These four themes are:

Strategic stakeholder interactions
For Arcadis stakeholder engagement means participating in conversations with internal and 
external stakeholders to deepen our insights into their needs and expectations. 
Arcadis’ stakeholders’ views are invaluable because they help us identify global trends, market 
expectations and maximize our impact. We seek to engage with them in a variety of methods 
including regular surveys on topics such as employee and customer satisfaction.

Case | PLACES 
How we are different
Arcadis is providing technical expertise for modernizing the entire 
building infrastructure required to house the Belgian Defense 
Forces’ new fighter jets.
Impact
The new buildings in Kleine-Brogel and Florennes will be some of 
the most sustainable military buildings in Belgium. 
Largest
geothermal installation in Flanders
The
Challenge
The
Solution
The
Impact
The Belgian Defense Forces are investing heavily in modernization and 
expansion. This resulted, among other things, in the purchase of thirty-
four F-35A fighter aircraft to replace the old F-16s. These state-of-the-art 
jets will be evenly distributed between two air bases in Florennes and 
Kleine-Brogel. However, the current building infrastructure used to house 
the aircraft dates from the 1950s and 1960s and is therefore not adapted 
to current standards for management, maintenance and security. Nor do 
the complexes meet sustainability requirements. 
As part of the modernization, a new complex is being built at each air 
base. Each will consist of an administrative area including office and 
meeting rooms, classrooms, auditoria, changing rooms, and a cafeteria; 
a logistics area for maintenance, workshops and warehousing; a high 
security building for planning operations and training, and 
accommodating four flight simulators; and the 'flightline’ area where the 
aircraft are housed. As part of a Design Build and Maintenance contract, 
Arcadis is working with a Joint Venture team providing full design and 
technical consultancy to ensure the buildings meet international 
requirements. Each complex will cover an area of 50,000 square meters, 
with maximum use of thermal insulation and renewable energy. Solar 
panels and a combination of geothermal and air-water heat pumps will 
provide the buildings with energy in a sustainable way.
Innovative new technologies have ensured that the complexes are fully 
future-proofed. For example, infra-red technology, which can be controlled 
electronically, has been chosen to heat the ovens used during the paint 
installation process. These need to meet temperatures as high as 200 
degrees Celsius, which had traditionally only been possible through gas 
combustion. Reducing reliance on fossil fuels limits harmful emissions, 
with similar renewable sources able to absorb up to 20 percent of total 
energy consumption in each complex. This will make the new buildings 
in Kleine-Brogel and Florennes some of the most sustainable military 
buildings in Belgium. The geothermal installation in Kleine-Brogel alone 
will be the largest in Flanders. 
 
 “ The buildings have to meet a lot of international 
requirements. There will be solar panels and a combination 
of geothermal and air-water heat pumps to provide energy 
in a sustainable way. ”

Sustainable Development Goals
Arcadis’ specialists provide safe and secure 
water technology and innovations to withstand 
fast changing demands in a warmer world. We 
cover the entire water cycle – from source to 
tap and back to nature. Arcadis’ leading 
practices in water supply and treatment, 
distribution, resource management, and 
industrial water & wastewater contribute to 
this SDG.
Target 6.1: By 2030, achieve universal and 
equitable access to safe and affordable drinking 
water for all.
Target 6.3: By 2030, improve water quality by 
reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and 
minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and 
materials, halving the proportion of untreated 
wastewater and substantially increasing 
recycling and safe reuse globally.
Clean Water and Sanitation 
Supporting the Sustainable Development Goals 
The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) drive sustainable 
development to ensure development meets people’s needs without compromising 
the lives of future generations. We contribute to the Goals mostly through project 
work on behalf of our clients. 
For all the project references spread throughout this Annual Integrated 
Report we have indicated which SDGs they touch
Sustainable Development Goals 
Out of the 17 SDGs, we focus on those relevant for Arcadis, as 
identified by leaders and sustainability specialists in every region we 
operate. Arcadians ranked the 169 targets of the seventeen SDGs on 
relevance for client work. This yielded ‘focused impact’ SDGs, where 
we leverage our skills, expertise, and global scale to contribute to their 
achievement through our core business. We also selected three 
‘specialized impact’ SDGs, where we contribute through specific 
services and solutions. 
The new methodology, by only using Oracle, covered less net revenues 
than before, but we expect that the net revenue not in scope has 
roughly a similar SDG relevance as the net revenue in scope of the new 
calculation approach. This led to a >80% net revenue relevant for the 
SDGs over 2022. Over 2021 figures we could apply the new approach 
as well, resulting in a similar percentage. For 2023 the aim is to have 
full net revenue in scope again, including from our recent acquisitions 
and from remaining countries not on Oracle. Comparative numbers on 
the year to year development and contribution to each SDG are 
provided at the end of the chapter.
The Focused Impact SDGs are:

With its clients, Arcadis works on eradicating 
the causes of climate change. Increasingly we 
also assist communities with strategies to 
combat its dangerous effects. We share our 
experience and leadership to co-create 
frameworks and guidance documents that 
influence policy makers globally.
Target 13.1: Strengthen resilience and adaptive 
capacity to climate-related hazards and natural 
disasters in all countries.
Target 13.2: Integrate climate change measures 
into national policies, strategies and planning.
Climate Action
In 2030, the global middle class will reach 5.3 
billion people, two billion more than today. 
Meeting the energy needs of all these people 
sustainably is one of the great challenges of our 
time. Arcadis experts assist governments and 
utilities in updating aging energy infrastructure, 
optimizing distribution networks, providing 
new sources of renewable energy, and 
facilitating the ecosystems that allow society to 
operate more efficiently, e.g., the transition to 
electric vehicles.
Target 7.2: By 2030, increase substantially the 
share of renewable energy in the global energy 
mix. 
Target 7.3: By 2030, double the global rate of 
improvement in energy efficiency.
Affordable and 
Clean Energy
The sustainable development of industrial 
manufacturing and mobility requires innovative 
answers. Arcadis connects communities, 
industries, and infrastructure safely, effectively 
and in balance with nature. With our industrial 
capex & operational efficiency solutions, and 
transport & mobility-oriented development 
solutions we support this SDG.
Target 9.1: Develop quality, reliable, sustainable 
and resilient infrastructure, including regional and 
transborder infrastructure, to support economic 
development and human well-being, with a focus 
on affordable and equitable access for all.
Target 9.4: By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and 
retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with 
increased resource-use efficiency and greater 
adoption of clean and environmentally sound 
technologies and industrial processes, with all 
countries taking action in accordance with their 
respective capabilities.
Industry, Innovation and 
Infrastructure
Earth’s rapidly growing population flocks to 
urban centers, placing ever-increasing pressure 
on resources, space and health & safety. Cities 
must respond to these stresses – their livability 
and competitiveness depends on it. Arcadis 
works with cities to give them a competitive 
edge and improving quality of life for their 
residents, visitors and businesses by building 
programs that expand resiliency, encourage 
regeneration, and maximize mobility.
Target 11.6: By 2030, reduce the adverse per 
capita environmental impact of cities, including 
by paying special attention to air quality and 
municipal and other waste management.
Target 11.7: By 2030, provide universal access to 
safe, inclusive and accessible, green and public 
spaces, in particular for women and children, 
older persons and persons with disabilities.

Healthy people are necessary for stable communities. Our work restoring 
land and soil quality by mitigating risks caused by leaked chemical 
compounds significantly contribute to this Goal. 
Arcadis assists clients with responsible management of assets and with 
identifying opportunities to increase the circularity of material and 
resource choices.
Land degradation is one of the world’s most pressing environmental 
problems, happening at an alarming pace, and it will worsen without 
rapid action. While land degradation is largely associated with 
unsustainable agriculture and resource extraction practices, past 
industrial activity has also rendered natural habitats unusable. Arcadis 
assists clients in maximizing opportunities to use nature-based solutions 
that results in a biodiversity net gain. 
Good Health and Wellbeing 
Target 3.9: By 2030, substantially reduce the 
number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous 
chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and 
contamination.
Responsible Consumption and Production
Target 12.5: By 2030, substantially reduce waste 
generation through prevention, reduction, 
recycling and reuse.
Life on Land
Target 15.5: Take urgent and significant action 
to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, 
halt the loss of biodiversity and, by 2020, protect 
and prevent extinction of threatened species 
(unlike other SDGs, most of the targets associated 
with SDG 15 have a deadline of 2020. Although 
we are past this deadline, Arcadis is committed to 
protecting and conserving natural habitats and 
biodiversity).

Case | RESILIENCE AND PLACES 
How we are different
Ground remediation, demolition and clearance works to bring a 
disused brownfield site back into use, creating a new community 
and boosting sustainable urban redevelopment in the city.
Impact
An attractive, future-proof urban neighborhood which – from the 
choice of location through to its design and realization - sets new 
standards for sustainability, and social and functional diversity.

new homes
From hospital site to urban residential area
Olga site, Stuttgart
The
Challenge
The
Solution
The
Impact
Situated in one of the largest historic areas in Germany, the post-war 
architecture of the Olga hospital had long looked out of place alongside 
the surrounding restored buildings dating back to the end of the 19th 
century. When the hospital was incorporated into Stuttgart’s central 
hospital, the old buildings could be demolished. For the Stuttgart 
authorities, this presented an opportunity to bring the site back to life – 
promoting brownfield regeneration and boosting sustainable urban 
development in the city. They wanted to create a future-oriented 
residential quarter with new homes and facilities for local people. In an 
attractive and central location, the development would set new standards 
in energy efficiency, sustainability, and social and functional diversity. 
Arcadis managed planning, tendering and monitoring processes for 
demolition and site clearance. Given the inner-city location - which had 
a surface area of 16,000 square meters and 210,000 cubic meters of 
buildings up to 40 meters high, all nestled among residential 
developments — this was a big challenge. The buildings had to be checked 
for hazardous substances and their removal before demolition could 
begin. There was also soil contamination to be addressed. During 
demolition we conducted extensive emission prevention measures 
(including protection against dust and noise). The site was also considered 
an unexploded bomb risk, which required extra safety measures. For 
structural reasons parts of the old buildings had to be left intact, but 
with some of the buildings having up to three levels of basements, 
groundwater dewatering was also required throughout. 
Through the restoration of the former Olga hospital site, west Stuttgart 
has gained an attractive new development location. On four construction 
sites, real estate developers and joint building ventures built 224 
residential units, 50% of which are publicly subsidized. The kindergarten, 
community center, stores, homes and open spaces are now filled with life, 
proving that this ambitious approach to urban space recycling has paid off 
— not just for those directly involved, but for the entire city.
 “ The conversion of a former hospital site into a new 
urban quarter is a shining example of successful and 
sustainable inner-city development and a great 
blueprint for future projects. ”

Developing our Culture
Our company values of: People first, Client Success, Integrity, Sustainability and Collaboration, continue to 
be the foundation of our culture. These values are supported by five key behaviours (We value each other, 
We deliver on our promises, We always bring our best, We dare to shape the future and we work as one 
team) along with our cultural pillars Inclusivity, Sustainability, Accountability and Human Centricity.  
In 2022 we nurtured our culture by focusing on: 
• Employees experiencing a more inclusive culture that supports them as individuals, by listening and 
taking action with a dedicated approach to our Global Affinity Groups and measuring our inclusivity 
through an Inclusion Index. 
• Developing greater accountability by ensuring leaders and managers follow through on their 
commitments and action feedback from their team in our regular engagement survey.
• Collaborative and flexible work by ensuring we follow through on our Workstyle promise and give 
Arcadians opportunities to share their expertise locally and globally. 
• Creating awareness on how sustainability impacts all Arcadians and the work they do, through access 
to a global Sustainability module as part our digital learning program. 
• Continuing to keep Integrity at the forefront through our integrity training for all Arcadians. 
Arcadis will continue to invest in building the global company culture that enables all Arcadians to achieve 
their full potential, and deliver on our digital and sustainable solutions for clients.

Workstyle Flexibility
In 2021 we launched the Global Workstyle Promise as we recognised that the way we work has changed 
over the past years. To support our People first value the Workstyle Promise continues to be implemented 
across Arcadis to provide a commitment to Arcadians around flexibility - enabling workstyles that truly 
work for individuals and their roles. To help further implement our commitment in this area, a range of 
workshops were held at the country level that helped translate our core promises into business unit 
guidelines. In 2022, we refreshed several offices to incorporate new Global Design Guidelines that advance 
user experience, promote sustainability and encourage workplace inclusion and flexibility. In 2022, 100% 
of employees have access to flexible working arrangements.
Employee Listening Approach 
Your Voice, our cornerstone employee dialogue program has built great momentum in 2022 and is now 
well embedded across the globe. Over 28,000 Arcadians have engaged in our quarterly employee survey, 
with an average of 87% participation for the year (not including recent acquisitions).
In 2022 Arcadian feedback through our Your Voice program has influenced multiple areas across the 
business to attract new talent, improve retention, build capability and improve the overall employee 
experience. The insights generated resulted in some key actions taken in 2022 that include:
• Enhanced communications of our business strategy through a dedicated strategy hub, global business 
townhalls and well-defined leadership and manager cascade channel.
• Greater collaboration across the Technology, Workplace, People and Procurement teams to address 
system and software access and equipment. This has led to the appointment of a Global End User 
Services Director and a new IT Service desk portal.
• Appointment of a Wellbeing and Resilience Manager to activate the strategy in place with regular 
wellbeing webinars and an enhanced Employee Assistance Program offering.
•  Shape the Arcadis Employee Experience, informing the development and monitoring of the programs 
and initiatives to progress towards being a best place to work and an inclusive organizational culture.
 
We are proud of the proactive approach we are taking and progress over the three years we are making 
across our employee experience:

 “ In 2014, we started the project with nothing. 
By the end of 2022, we can count 26 newly 
constructed bridges and several more now raised. ”
Wim Van Hout | Program manager
How we are different
Overall supervision of the project, with end-to-end support from 
conception to the completion of the project. 
Impact
Raising the height of the bridges not only boosts inland navigation 
capacity and supports economic growth, but also helps to remove 
traffic from the roads and reduce harmful carbon emissions. 
25%
increase in shipping capacity
Modifying the Albert Canal
Supporting sustainable transport development in Belgium 
The
Challenge
The
Solution
The
Impact
As consumer demand for goods increases across Belgium, so too does the 
number of journeys that lorries need to make to deliver goods. All of these 
trucks add to congestion on roadways and also produce emissions that 
are harmful to the environment and people’s health. Transporting these 
goods via waterways is a more sustainable alternative to trucks, but the 
most important inland waterway in Flanders, the Albert Canal, doesn’t 
currently have enough capacity, thanks to the limited height and width 
of its bridges. This has been holding back the potential for inland 
navigation growth.
To address the problem, Arcadis is supporting Flemish Waterway 
(de Vlaamse Waterweg NV) in raising the height of 31 bridges to 9.10 m 
above the canal level. This will allow ships to move through the canal 
with more shipping containers on board. 
Of the 31 bridges along the canal, 15 are being rebuilt under a PPP-DBFM; 
a public-private partnership agreement that includes design, construction, 
financing and maintenance for 30 years. The other 16 bridges will be put 
out to tender on a regular basis. Arcadis is carrying out concept and 
stability studies, defining strategy and guiding the client in obtaining the 
necessary authorizations. By phasing the work, we are able to reduce any 
associated nuisance, for example by creating appropriate detours and 
properly organizing traffic during construction. 
Raising the bridges over the Albert canal allows ships to transport up to 
four levels of containers; an increase in capacity of 25%. This not only 
boosts inland navigation capacity and supports economic growth, but 
also reduces traffic on the roads. A single 1,200-ton ship can replace as 
many as 50 trucks. Over the course of a year, this amounts to more than 
two million trucks being removed from the roads, which in turn will have 
a significant impact on reducing harmful CO2 emissions.

At Arcadis, we continue to strive to be recognised as the best place to work, measured through employee 
engagement (KPI – increasing annually), and by acting upon employee feedback. We have also established 
a voluntary turnover rate KPI of <10% by 2023 and in 2022, the result was 14.7%. Core programs that are 
in place to bridge the gap and improve employee engagement include:
• Employee Listening Program – ‘Your Voice’ , we frequently listen and set engagement actions on what 
matters most to our employees.
• The performance development framework, ‘Grow Perform Succeed’ (GPS). This provides employees 
with regular dialogue with their managers on performance and career development.
• Learning and talent development programs, such as mentoring and digital learning opportunities to 
enhance Arcadian's ability to perform in their current roles and prepare for future opportunities. 
• Line management development – a dedicated global program to upskill the development for our line 
management to ensure our teams are led by capable and inspiring managers.
• A diversity and belonging strategy – with key input from our Global Affinity Groups to ensure we work 
on actions that matter most to our underrepresented groups. 
Given the changing workplace, understanding the employee experience and expectations is constantly 
evolving. Our integrated people analytics platform allows us to combine data and present this to 
leadership monthly to help inform data driven decisions around our people proposition. Our monthly 
people indicators are also aligned to our company people strategy to ensure there is a regular review on 
how we meet our strategic objectives.
Attracting Arcadians
We attracted over 7,000 new Arcadians in 2022. This has been done within a competitive talent market, 
hiring for skills to support our digital transformation and increasing the focus on diverse and inclusive 
hiring. We increased investment across our core sourcing channels in 2022 to ensure continued growth 
of our global LinkedIn recruiter and branding solutions. Through our global partnerships with Indeed 
and Glassdoor it opened access to over 200 countries and 300 million candidate visitors per month. 
Our business in the UK was again named in the Glassdoor’s Top 50 Best Places to Work.
Our global career site enables candidates – both internally and externally, to find relevant jobs quickly as 
well as join our talent community and be notified for relevant roles. We have also been able to implement 
a global applicant tracking system - Recruit Cloud. The new system has also resulted in wider visibility of 
our roles not only internally but also in the external market where we had over 385,000 candidate 
applications.
To ensure we are positioned well to attract a wide range of candidates from under-represented groups we 
are incorporating diversity hiring through our talent acquisition approach. Some example programs are: 
Early Careers
Attracting and selecting early careers talent has again operated in a hybrid way during 2022 with virtual, 
on campus and in office activities supporting the attraction and selection of graduates, interns and 
vacation students. In a historically male dominated industry, our focus on attracting women talent into 
our early careers opportunities remains critical. We aim to ensure a balance in gender representation 
Attracting and engaging a global workforce
The global market for talent in 2022 continued to be competitive and although we saw our engagement 
levels increase, with increased demand from our global business areas, attracting, retaining and engaging 
Arcadians continued to be a key priority for 2022.

progressing through every stage of the recruitment process. Significant success in these efforts has 
resulted in 53% of our new graduates and interns in the United States being women in 2022; in the UK this 
was 43% while in Australia we reached 66%.
STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts & Mathematics)
In Australia, to develop diverse talent pools, we believe it is vital to foster relationships with mid-education 
providers and ignite a passion for STEAM subjects in high-school students. In 2022 we have hosted events 
for more than 75 women students in Arcadis Australian offices, with the objective of providing real-world 
learning opportunities and guidance on education pathways into our industry and Arcadis. 
Our UK team has an ongoing partnership with Career Ready, a social mobility charity focused on 
providing opportunities, confidence and skills to young people who potentially face barriers in education 
and employment and whose talents often go undiscovered. In 2022, we hosted six paid work experiences, 
recruited 25 mentors and hosted a variety of workshops across Arcadis UK offices. In addition, Arcadians 
organised a range of local school visits using their charity days to create STEAM awareness in local 
communities.
Talent Development: Developing as an Arcadian 
Providing all Arcadians with access to quality learning opportunities is critical to enhance their ability to 
perform in their current roles, prepare for future opportunities and maximize their impact. To achieve this, 
we have extended the ability of our people to access learning through our Learning Management System 
– Learn Cloud. Working with the Lovinklaan Foundation, we have developed three new sustainability 
modules to help our people connect with our global strategy. As a global organization, we are now able to 
offer all our people, wherever they are, the opportunity to become accredited in a variety of project and 
program management qualifications – a continuation of our ambition to create a truly equitable 
experience for all our people. 
 
Arcadians Grow, Perform and Succeed (GPS)
GPS is our global approach to performance development. It focuses on continuous and meaningful 
performance conversations between line manager and their team members. It aims to create a safe 
environment focusing on growth and learning, developing a culture of feedback and recognition. 
In 2022, we had 75% (2021: 71%) of Arcadians undertake a performance and career discussion with their 
line manager. Arcadis employee engagement data over past two years show a continuous increase in 
results related to Goal Setting, Growth, Mentoring and Recognition and we see continuously positive 
feedback to further embed a feedback culture at Arcadis.
Mentoring for all Arcadians 
At Arcadis, we recognize the value of mentoring and through our global mentoring platform Mentor 
Connect, which provides equal access to mentoring for all Arcadians across the world, helping them to 
make greater connections with leaders across the business and support their development. Arcadians are 
embracing different forms of mentoring, being it more traditional mentoring, reverse mentoring or even 
reciprocal mentoring, helping to foster inter-generational and inter-cultural and cross-hierarchy 
relationships throughout the organization. Engagement with the platform has almost doubled over the 
course of 2022 with 2,800 Arcadians now signed up to Mentor Connect (up from 1650 in 2021), resulting 
in 1,400 established mentoring relationships (up from 650 in 2021) of which 39% are cross-country 
mentoring relationships.

Throughout 2022, the Expedition DNA program has continued to build a critical mass of business 
ambassadors for digital, sustainability, and our overall business strategy. Having the workforce understand 
and have digital knowledge and skills is central to ensuring our business transformation. 
Expedition DNA continues to comprise of two elements: an online, gamified immersive journey to 
develop a common language and base level understanding of digital, sustainability, and our business 
strategy; and an experiential five-week virtual learning journey known as ‘expeditions’ .
Increased engagement
There continues to be an increase in Arcadians both engaging and completing Base Camp. Currently, 
21,824 Arcadians are participating in the program, representing 80% of Arcadis’ employees (not 
including recent acquisitions). This is a 9% increase in engagement in the program during 2022. 
Over the last 12 months, 223 Arcadians have joined and completed a fully virtual expedition. 
These selected participants have had the opportunity to deep-dive into six ‘Skill Labs’ focusing on 
sustainability, customer experience, data, platforms, ecosystems and business models, and change 
management/transformation. On completion of the program, participants are equipped with new digital 
and sustainability skills, as well as transformational capabilities that see them eligible to join the 
network of organizational ambassadors driving organizational change, engaging clients in new 
approaches, and building sustainability into everything we do.
Accessibility improvements
Significant improvements have been made to the accessibility of the program in 2022 to ensure it 
engages with even more Arcadians. In collaboration with our platform development partners, 
‘Base Camp’ has been redesigned and relaunched with improvements that satisfy the internationally 
recognised standards for digital accessibility. 
Expedition DNA - developing Arcadians’ digital skills
The Lovinklaan Foundation, and Arcadis, are aligned on ensuring Expedition DNA continues to be the 
cornerstone program that enables Arcadians to develop future-focused skills that ensures the realization 
of our business strategy.

“ I’m so grateful for the support we’ve received from country leaders.

How we are different
Social impact movement provides funding to empower Arcadians 
to improve quality of life in their neighborhoods though 
community projects.

Solution
The
Impact
When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, governments globally were forced 
to impose strict measures to restrict transmission. One such country 
affected was the Philippines, with potentially one of the world’s longest 
lockdowns. In many provinces, this created a whole new set of socio-
economic challenges for the indigenous Aeta population – most 
importantly, inadequate access to a safe, clean and continuous water 
supply. On learning of the plight of the Aeta peoples, Arcadian Donna 
Anne Matutina worked with colleagues to directly help these 
communities, supported by funding through the Arcadis Local Sparks 
program. This is a social impact movement funded by Arcadis, the 
Lovinklaan Foundation and the KNHM Foundation aimed at empowering 
Arcadis employees to improve quality of life in their neighborhoods 
though community projects. 
The main water source for the Aeta people was the river, but it’s a long 
way from where the community resides. As a result, family members spent 
hours fetching water. With proper access, this time could be saved and 
used on other activities that support local livelihoods or for leisure and 
family bonding, improving quality of life for the community. Donna Anne 
Matutina got involved in supporting the Aeta community early on during 
COVID-19 lockdowns. Initially by providing clothing and other essential 
items, as well as ensuring access to education. Then when funding became 
available through Arcadis and the Local Sparks program, Donna saw an 
opportunity to create a wider, longer-lasting impact.
“Pumps for Life” is the program that Donna created to serve the needs of 
a community that has struggled with access to safe, clean drinking water 
for too long. Having applied for funding, in little more than three weeks 
Donna was able to fast-track and install 23 jetmatic and hand pump 
facilities for the Aeta community. These provide reliable, easy access to 
water for over 400 people across the region, addressing basic needs and 
supporting better health, sanitation and resources for livestock, poultry 
and vegetation.
Safe access to clean, chlorine-free water is a basic human right – not just 
for a few, but for all. Sustainable Development Goal 6 is about ‘clean 
drinking water for all and, through the “Pumps for Life” program, Donna 
has been able to ensure that no one in this community is left behind.

Improving the experience of our managers worldwide through the Line Management 
Experience (LMEx)
At Arcadis, we recognize that people managers have a big impact on the transformation of our business 
and play a critical role in the performance, engagement, and retention of those they manage. The Line 
Management Experience (LMEx) is aimed at supporting our managers to successfully lead with impact. 
In 2022, various leadership engagement sessions took place to raise awareness of the critical role of 
people managers and to get stakeholders’ support for new interventions to further improve the people 
management experience and effectiveness. As a result, a global onboarding journey for newly appointed 
managers was launched to bring consistency to the employee experience for newly appointed managers 
(hired and promoted) and set them up for success during this important transition. A total of 571 new 
people managers - appointed between July and December 2022 - started this journey. 
There was continued investment this year in the development of our people managers with many 
opportunities to develop their skills in highly interactive, virtual sessions empowering them to lead 
their teams with impact. In 2022, 136 sessions as part of the Management Essentials curriculum 
were organized for new and emerging people managers, which attracted more than 2,500 attendees. 
In addition, 95 sessions as part of the Advanced Management curriculum took place for more 
experienced people managers, with over 1,000 attendees. The sessions were well received with 
an excellent Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 68 overall. 
Outside the LMEx curricula, a total of 5 LMEx Labs were organized to address relevant, business critical 
and strategic topics which attracted close to 1,900 Arcadis people managers in total. The topics covered 
in the LMEx Labs included:
• “The Future of Work: Standardization and Automation” to raise awareness about how Arcadis is 
rethinking how we create value in our business and for our clients through Standardization & 
Automation.
• “Cross-Cultural Awareness & Global Collaboration” to support managers in collaborating across 
geographical borders and in a culturally diverse environment. 
• “Managing Engagement & Retention in your Team” to help managers understand what is motivating 
people to stay or leave and the importance of the manager role in engagement and retention.
People Leadership
Arcadis is a people business where it requires strong people leadership. Central to this is the ability 
to create strong and psychological safe teams and an environment where everyone can flourish 
and bring their whole self to work.

For the third year in a row, there is an improvement in how Arcadis people managers are perceived by 
those they manage. Manager specific questions in our internal engagement survey Your Voice show that 
Arcadians increasingly feel that their line manager cares about them as a person and their opinions, their 
manager communicates openly and honestly with them and supports their performance and 
development. The Your Voice scores for these questions are also above the industry benchmark for 
professional services.

Strengthening senior leadership, while also building strong leadership pipelines 
and driving progression for future leadership
Ensuring we have strong leadership in place today is key to driving our strategy, sustaining our business, 
and engaging our people. Aligned to our Leadership Model, successful leaders at Arcadis possess strong 
learning agility, combined with a balanced mix of being curious, driving success and igniting passion. 
In 2022 we focused efforts on: 
• The Aligned Leadership Program (ALP) was launched in 2021 to develop our senior leaders and help 
them to lead and embed the strategy and transformation. In 2022 Impact Circles (small peer-to-peer 
sessions) were introduced as part of ALP to create stronger peer connections amongst senior leaders. 
A total of 19 Impact Circles of 3 sessions each were organized over the course of 2022, facilitated by 
internal facilitators and which attracted close to 110 senior leaders.
• Moreover, 35 senior leaders went through our individual development process, using an assessment to 
provide personal insights into their leadership style, preferences, traits, and drivers, followed by 
coaching conversations. It gives our leaders an opportunity to reflect on their journey to date, and the 
insights that they gain are valuable for development in their current leadership role and further success 
in Arcadis.
• For key leadership roles that directly lead our business, talent pools exist with potential candidates. In 
2022, we saw an internal successor being nominated as the next CEO and Chair of the Executive Board. 
In addition, of the most senior leadership appointments made in 2022, 66% were internal Arcadians or 
drawn from our new business acquisitions. 
• Emergency replacement plans are in place for the most senior and business-critical roles to mitigate 
risk. These are all agreed with the emergency replacements to ensure this person is willing and able to 
pursue this when needed and includes ongoing and regular contact moments.
• The launch of the Leadership Discovery journey for leadership potentials, which is a defined program 
that facilitates self-reflection and pro-active personal development, connects them with peers and 
builds a strong leadership network for the future. This year 28 leadership potentials started their 
Leadership Discovery journey, a number that is expected to increase in the years to come.

Improving quality of life by respecting human rights 
We believe that treating people with dignity and respect is foundational to being a responsible business. 
Our purpose is to improve quality of life by – fostering an environment that is conducive to respecting 
human rights within our business; contributing to solutions that meet the pressing social challenges of 
our time (through relationships with our supply chain partners, clients and communities). 
We strive to apply the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). Our Human Rights 
& Labor Policy and associated due diligence process are in place to allow us to understand, avoid and 
address harm to people and make a positive impact on society. This includes our own operations and the 
entire value chain. We have the ambition to do this by enabling our people to: 
• do business with respect for human rights and implementing a human rights due diligence process to 
prevent, mitigate, and remediate any negative human rights impacts caused by, contributed to, or 
linked to our business, and 
• bring their full self to work, promoting a human centred, psychologically healthy and safe environment 
underpinned by social justice, diversity, equity, inclusion, and a culture of belonging throughout our 
employee lifecycle. 
In 2022, we worked with our employees, clients, investors, suppliers and other stakeholders to start 
implementing our Human Rights and Labor Policy. This included: 
Arcadians 
•  We focused on training and creating awareness among Arcadians on human rights, what our 
responsibility is and how Arcadians can become active ambassadors in implementing our human 
rights policy. 
•  We conducted a human rights impact assessment of our operations in the Philippines. The assessment 
included a focus on privacy, discrimination, equal and fair treatment, working hours, access to remedy/ 
a grievance mechanism. Follow-up recommendations were provided, and with a taskforce team, we have 
prioritised and set actions for each of the recommendations. Where applicable, actions apply directly in 
the Philippines, surrounding areas and in some cases globally.
Our mission is to improve quality of life by fostering an environment that is conducive to respecting human 
rights within our business and in the relationships with supply chain, clients and communities – contributing 
to solutions that meet the pressing social challenges of our time. 
We do this by enabling people to bring their full self to work, promoting a human centred, psychologically 
healthy and safe environment underpinned by social justice, diversity, equity, inclusion and a culture of 
belonging throughout our employee lifecycle.

Clients 
• Having incorporated human rights criteria in our client go-no-go procedure, we have also developed 
guidance for our account managers on how to assess the human rights performance of our clients. 
Our new human rights methodology, along with training and support for Arcadians and continued 
awareness around these human rights expectations underpins our client approach. 
Procurement 
• Arcadis’ refreshed Supplier Code of Conduct that reflects alignment with our human rights and labor 
policy, is now accompanied by a pre-qualification questionnaire that includes human rights questions to 
assess the human rights performance of our suppliers.
Grievance mechanism 
•  We improved our grievance mechanism by opening our Integrity line to all internal and external 
stakeholders, see page 129. A grievance mechanism is a core UNGP requirement, and we have 
externally reviewed and assessed our integrity line for consistency against the effectiveness criteria 
of the UNGPs. Recommendations are being worked on. 
Communication of Rights
Arcadis has continued its employee consultation on relevant matters whereby it respects the rights of 
works councils as employee representation bodies and the role of works councils and/or trade unions in 
collective bargaining. In particular, we engaged with our European Works Council to discuss and inform 
them on transnational matters that significantly affected employees’ interests across Europe. This 
consultation occurred across a variety of issues and due to employee representation on the council, 
resulted in their feedback contributing to the shape of the overall Arcadis strategic direction. 
In addition, Arcadis actively works with various representation and consultation bodies in countries in 
which they are present. In 2022, 26% of the workforce is represented by a consultation body (i.e works 
council, trade union) and 26% of the Arcadis workforce is covered by a collective labour agreement. 
Overall, the local and European consultation bodies are actively engaged, informed and consulted on 
the three-year company strategy and connected transformation programs.
2022-2025 TENT Commitment – Refugee Talent Program 
Continuing our commitment to TENT in 2022, we pledged to offering employment opportunities to 
65 refugees across Europe over the next three years, as part of our commitment to attracting diverse 
talent and providing an inclusive working environment. Arcadis offers an internship and/or mentorship 
program that provides training, coaching and work experience to support refugees build a new future. 
In 2022, during the ‘Second Dutch Business Summit on Refugees’ , Arcadis renewed its 
commitment to support refugees’ economic integration with (The Tent Partnership for 
Refugees) TENT. This commitment builds on our pledge made at the First Dutch Business 
Summit on Refugees in 2019. TENT, a non-profit organization mobilizes the global business 
community to include refugees.

Collaboration 
We believe that respect for human rights is fundamental to living in a sustainable society and we are 
committed to monitoring and embedding a clear and definable approach to human rights. It is that same 
reason we chose to confront systemic challenges that no actor can alone solve, by collaborating with the 
World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). We have taken an active and frontline 
approach in particular, in the Business Commission to Tackle Inequality (BCTI) – where Peter Oosterveer 
has taken position as a CEO commissioner in an initiative that seeks to tackle inequality and generate 
shared prosperity for all. Our progress is also reflected in the recent assessment of the WBCSD, which 
indicated that we are complaint and significantly ambitious on human rights, DEIB and non-discrimination 
- proving we are on the right path. 
Our mission is to improve quality of life, by promoting an inclusive, diverse, people-centered, accountable, 
and sustainable culture and work environment, where everyone can be their authentic selves.
We want every Arcadian to feel that they belong and can succeed in Arcadis, where differences among 
Arcadians that make them unique are recognized, valued and celebrated. Our approach is simple, we 
believe that by investing in four interventions, we are creating environments that attract, retain, and 
develop Arcadians while meeting diverse client needs and expectations. 
Recognition of our strategy
We are proud of the impact we’ve made, and the significant industry recognition. In November 2022 
both the Financial Times and Forbes ranked Arcadis as Diversity Leaders for 2023. 
• Financial Times - Diversity Leaders 2023: based on independent surveys of employees and our 
commitment to Diversity, Belonging & Human Rights.
• Forbes - World’s Top Female-Friendly Companies 2023: also independently verified based on 
equity such as competitive pay, opportunities for career advancement, flexible working arrangements, 
and more.
 
For the second year in a row, Arcadis has scored a perfect 100 points on the Human Rights Campaign 
Foundation’s Corporate Equality Index (CEI). CEI is regarded as the United States foremost benchmarking 
survey and report measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. 
This year’s index rated 1,271 U.S. based companies. Our score has improved from 95 in 2020.
In 2021 we launched an annual Diversity Representation listening survey, to help us better understand 
who Arcadians are and what they need to feel safe and included at work. Our global Diversity 
Representation survey offers the optional opportunity for Arcadians to provide anonymous information 
about their diverse characteristics and differing perspectives. These valuable insights enable us to better 
understand the nuances of what influences experiences at Arcadis to develop and implement the most 
impactful programs. 
 
We have established and progressed a number of significant programmes during 2022.
Five CEO sponsored global Affinity Groups
In creating five global affinity groups: Access & Neurodiversity, Age Representation, Ethnicity & Heritage, 
Gender, and PRIDE - we have created executive-sponsored forums for employees to represent their needs 
and lived experiences. Our intersectional approach embeds areas such as faith and well-being.
Our global affinity groups span several countries and all business areas and represent a wide and diverse 
spectrum of people. They are actively curating a renewed workplace culture where we can make 
impactful change together. Meaningful results in their first year include: 
•  Sharing and supporting by creating community safe spaces for Arcadians 
•  Celebrating and educating by establishing a digital resource hub, inclusive language guide, I Am 
Remarkable workshops and schedule of monthly webinars reaching over 20,000 Arcadians
•  Advocating for communities by challenging bias in behaviors, processes and existing ways of working, 
language used in training materials and in meetings
•  Consulting and advising by providing strategic input to leadership on decisions that affect employees, 
or spearheading the development of global frameworks such our Social Justice Framework.

Providing a Voice for our Women of Color (WoC) 
Our WoC program, launched in February 2022, aims to understand the intersectional impact that gender 
and ethnicity have on the experiences and career progression of Women of Color in Arcadis. We are using 
these insights to co-create solutions that will lead to an equitable environment where each Arcadian, 
current or future, has access to opportunities to enable them to grow, develop and achieve their full 
potential. This is a first for Arcadis. We are following its success by creating forums that help us identify 
hidden underrepresented talent – feeding directly into our talent pipelines. 
Global Sponsorship Program 
Sponsorship is most often cited as a success factor in corporate careers; however, it is not necessarily 
something that everyone benefits from or has access to. Our new global sponsorship program is designed 
to create the environment for Arcadians from underrepresented groups to access leadership networks 
and support to progress their careers. Launched in 2022, it will be fully implemented globally in 2023.
Diversity spotlight – Pay equity
In 2022, we continued with our work towards ensuring equitable pay across our business, including our 
transparent reporting on our Gender Pay Gap in line with legal obligations in Australia and the UK. In the 
UK our Gender Pay Gap has reduced by 2.2% in year to 19.2% and in Australia our gender pay gap is 
24.1% (2021: 24.2%).
 
We recognize that pay gaps are ultimately affected by representation and are reduced by increased 
diversity at all levels across the business, particularly in senior leadership. Our work to increase 
representation in this area includes our:
• Global Sponsorship Program for under-represented groups (including women and ethnic minorities).
• Collaboration between the Diversity and the Talent Acquisition teams to remove bias from our 
recruitment and progression practices.
• I Am Remarkable global workshops – coaching our people to articulate their value in career discussions
Diversity in Leadership: Supervisory Board, Executive Board and Senior Leaders 
It is essential for us to have diverse leaders with a broad range of skills, a variety of backgrounds and 
diversity of thought. We set diversity targets for our senior leadership group to reinforce our 
understanding that we can only meaningfully support our clients if we ourselves are diverse and reflect 
the communities we work in. Our focus is around: gender, nationality/ geographical provenance, and 
background (education and/or (work) experience). For our leadership targets in line with the Dutch 
Diversity Bill, see the paragraph on specific diversity reporting which is included in the People Metrics 
Appendix on page 280 of this Annual Integrated Report.
As a global company we recognize there is underrepresentation of certain minority groups in our 
workforce around the world. We believe that a focused commitment to implementing targeted practices 
with these groups helps us to create a strong, dynamic company producing the most innovative ideas for 
a competitive edge both locally as well as globally. Over the last couple years, our main focus has been on 
gender equity at a global level and look to extend this to other under-represented areas.

Cultivating Wellbeing 
Fostering purpose and supporting Arcadians to feel physically and psychologically healthy and safe at 
work, creates a more resilient workforce and improves our wellbeing. That is why we have taken a data 
and insight driven approach in 2022 to amplify our global wellbeing and resilience roadmap. We are 
focussed on a preventive approach, amplified in the ongoing promotion of wellbeing initiatives. Our 
wellbeing roadmap focuses on primary intervention at an organisational level through the mitigation of 
workplace hazards which may have a negative impact on the wellbeing of Arcadians. 
Reinforcing our holistic approach across several wellbeing pillars (mental, physical, social, emotional, 
financial and workplace wellbeing), we are establishing our Arcadis Five Ways to Health, Safety, and 
Wellbeing:
Health
A state of good physical and mental health, energy and resilience is achieved and sustained for all. 
Purpose
Improving the quality of workplace wellbeing through engagement, job quality and career 
development opportunities.
Security
By prioritizing work design, social factors at work and the working environment we ensure 
the health, safety, and wellbeing of all Arcadians.
Relationships
Our global way of working requires the development of trusting, collaborative and 
empathic relationships with line managers and colleagues. All Arcadians feel valued, 
supported, and connected.
Belonging
Environments where all employees are respected, accepted, and included. Employees 
identify with Arcadis values, find meaning in their work and feel empowered to bring their 
authentic self to work.
People  
First
With a defined Wellbeing Roadmap in place, in 2022, we proactively moved towards improving the 
wellbeing of all Arcadians by: 
•  Globalizing our employee assistance program reaching an additional 1,600 Arcadians and their family 
members. We have upgraded our offerings which now include emotional and mental support, Cognitive 
Behavioural Therapy, physical support through wellness coaching, practical support including 
dependent care, legal and financial advice and manager assistance.
•  Hosting Global Wellbeing & Resilience Webinars where over 20,000 Arcadians voluntarily attended 
our wellbeing webinars, often featuring guest speakers and additional resources. Engaged colleagues 
benefit from supplemented resources to facilitate continued support, discourse and learning amongst 
teams and even loved ones.

 “ It has been a rewarding experience to work with a forward-thinking 
utility to develop this innovative approach to a sustainable and resilient 
water-management solution. ”
Chris Waters | Principal Engineer
How we are different
We are leading the conversion of a rock quarry into a water supply 
reservoir that will enhance the resilience of the county’s drinking 
water system.
Impact
The transformed quarry can store enough water to meet residents’ 
needs for up to two months, enhancing resilience for the region, 
providing system reliability and mitigating supply issues.

Bolstering drinking water resilience in Loudoun County
Milestone Reservoir, Virginia, US
The
Challenge
The
Solution
The
Impact
Loudoun County has one of the fastest growing populations in the 
United States. People living here, and in much of the Washington D.C. 
metropolitan area, get their drinking water from the Potomac River. 
However, conditions such as drought can jeopardize supply. Conversely, 
too much water – such as after heavy rainfall – also leads to complications 
by increasing the turbidity of the water, which means it then requires more 
effort and more chemicals to make safe for human consumption. Our 
client Loudoun Water provides drinking and wastewater services for more 
than 80,000 households. We’ve partnered with them on a groundbreaking 
project to help safeguard the clean drinking water supply for residents and 
enhance the overall water resilience of the region.
We are leading planning and design efforts to convert a retired rock 
quarry into a water supply reservoir, including a new 40-million-gallon 
per day pumping station to pump water to the local treatment plant. 
The system includes a 300-foot-deep pump shaft and, to optimize water 
quality, three withdrawal tunnels at varying elevations. A series of vertical 
submersible raw water pumps will transfer water from the reservoir for 
treatment. Once the quarry reservoir is online, the pumping station will 
be used to fill the quarry when there is ample water in the river and 
conditions are such that the water is of good quality. During drought 
conditions or periods when water quality is suboptimal, raw water can be 
pumped from the quarry for treatment, instead of directly from the river. 
This innovative water banking approach to managing limited supply is 
the first of its kind in the region.
The construction of the reservoir will transform a retired rock quarry into 
a new water supply source for the Washington DC Metro region. It will be 
large enough to store one billion gallons of water, enough water to meet 
residents’ needs for up to two months, enhancing resilience for the region, 
providing system reliability and helping to mitigate water supply impacts 
during drought periods or as the result of storms or other water supply 
emergencies. When these events occur, the treatment plant can use 
source water that has already been stored in the quarry reservoir in lieu of 
taking it directly from the Potomac River. This approach offers treatment 
flexibility and climate resilience for the region’s water supply needs.

People and culture
The Health & Safety Program is the responsibility of a Global team, led by the Global H&S Director, who 
directly reports to the Global Operations Projects Services Officer (GOPS) accountable for H&S. The 
GOPS Officer reports to the Chief Operating Officer and the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) member 
responsible for Project Services. The Executive Board, Senior Leadership, and all Arcadis staff understand, 
believe in, demonstrate, and communicate the H&S commitments and engage in continuous 
improvement under the auspices of the Global H&S Management System standard, which has been 
designed to harmonize H&S processes across the Company. It focuses on proactive hazard recognition, 
risk assessment, and risk control to prevent accidents, and allows for the nuances of local culture, client 
expectations, and regulations. It includes comprehensive education and training (through internal and 
external seminars, amongst others) to provide employees with the knowledge and tools to enable them 
to eliminate injuries and illness at work and at home. Best practices and lessons learned from incidents 
relating to the workplace and travel are shared via documentation or information systems. In addition, 
by teaming up with an external travel safety, security, and health services company, employees have 
constant access to information on preventive measures to eliminate or minimize risks. 
Effective management (e.g., assessment, mitigation, and prevention) of work-related H&S risks is ensured 
through:
• Prioritization and action plans with quantified targets;
• Involvement of leadership and business managers on a regular basis, as well as engagement between 
H&S leadership and GBA management on at least a quarterly basis;
• Review of work-related incidents (see step six of the principles as described on the next page);
• Conducting internal inspections and consultations by H&S specialists;
• Independent external verification of health, safety, and wellbeing;
• H&S targets are encouraged to be embedded in performance appraisals;
• Safety culture through behavior-based observations and shared information;
• Celebrating successes through safety competition, recognition, and rewards.
The Global H&S Management System identifies and tracks work-related risks through annual risk 
identification and assessment at business level (e.g., tracking incidents). Actual performance is captured in 
a consolidation tool and reported monthly. Data is measured using standard definitions and measurement 
techniques that typically match those of regulatory bodies that are relevant to Arcadis’ operations and 
those of clients. Definitions are explained in the Global H&S Management System standard and the 
H&S performance monitoring and reporting guideline. H&S professionals review the data before 
submission, including assessing comparisons to other operating companies, historical performance, and 
targets and objectives. The aggregate result is presented to the ELT and included in quarterly reporting 
to the Executive Board and Supervisory Board. 
Performance 2022 
Arcadis’ 2022 Total Recordable Case Frequency (TRCF) increased from the prior year (0.15 compared to 
0.14 in 2021). Despite this small increase, 2022 represents one of the safest year since Arcadis began 
collecting Global H&S data in 2004, when TRCF was 1.13. Overall, Arcadis’ TRCF has decreased by 50% 
over the past five years. 
Health and Safety
The health, safety, and wellbeing of employees and stakeholders is central to everything we do at 
Arcadis. The Health & Safety (H&S) Global Vision and Policy focuses on a culture that strives for zero 
incidents using the TRACK process (for an explanation on TRACK, see the box in this section with our 
six fundamental Health & Safety principles).

Comparing 2022 to 2021, the following observations were noted:
• With the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic decreasing, more Arcadis offices continued to open 
and slowly people started returning to their offices. These changing conditions and the switching 
between home office and Arcadis’ office complicate operations and distract from H&S resulting in 
recordable incidents related to both the home and the Arcadis office environment that have been seen 
before the pandemic.
• Arcadis’ core business activities remained substantially the same in 2022 and, as such, the risk of health 
and safety incidents occurring did not significantly change. However, 2022 saw an increase in field 
hours vs. 2021 as more countries saw a return to full access on site for both field crews and managers. 
More time in the field resulted in an increased exposure to higher hazard environments and a small 
increase in recordable incidents.
• More recordable incidents have been recorded due to ergonomic complaints and continued strain on 
specific types of muscles due to repetitive movement. These have been observed by both field crews, 
and people working from home.
• Two recordable incidents have been recorded that were out of Arcadis’ control. On two different 
occasions an Arcadis employee was rear-ended while waiting at a red traffic light. Both incidents 
resulted in recordable incidents. 
Our Lost Time Case Frequency (LTCF) for 2022 (0.05) stayed the same as in 2020 and 2021. Arcadis’ LTCF 
has decreased by 61% over the past five years. There were no appreciable differences in the nature or type 
of lost-time injuries between 2021 and 2022. There were no work-related fatalities in 2022, nor any over 
the preceding five-year period. 
Arcadis’ injury rates continue to remain far below the average injury rates of the publicly available US 
benchmarks for the architecture and engineering industry, which were 0.50 (TRCF) and 0.20 (LTCF) for 
the most recent reporting period (2020). 
Near miss reporting, a key process in helping to prevent incidents, continues to increase (74% above 
reporting in 2021), which is indicative of a continued improvement in hazard recognition and greater 
stewardship for sharing experiences to help prevent future injuries. 
Global H&S objectives for 2022 included all Arcadis leaders level 10 and 11 completing at least one H&S 
stewardship activity per 6 months, leaders level 12 and higher completing at least 1 H&S stewardship 
activity per quarter, and for 90% of all staff performing a documented proactive health and safety action. 
These objectives were included to drive greater health & safety engagement by leadership and staff and 
to encourage further development of our proactive health and safety culture. Engagement by both 
leadership and staff was strong; 90% of leaders were compliant with their H&S Stewardship activities 
(a slight increase from 89% in 2021) and 75% of staff performed a documented proactive H&S action in 
2021 (a slight decrease from 78% of staff in 2021). An additional objective required all projects that take 
place outside of an office environment to have a well-defined H&S Plan (HASP) in place before site 
activities begin; due to the change in reporting via Oracle there was a slight backlog in registering HASP 
plans into the system, however, auditing shows that HASPs are in place.
We also aligned our People First commitment by focusing on the health and wellbeing of our people 
in 2022. ISO 45003, Psychosocial Risk management, was introduced into the revised version of the 
Global Health & Safety Management System Standard. The overall purpose of our program is to develop 
people-centric solutions that improve quality of life for Arcadians. We endeavor to nurture the physical, 
mental, and social wellbeing of Arcadians to create a psychologically safe and heathy workplace where all 
can thrive. Improving employee wellbeing & resilience is fundamental to Arcadis to create the following 
benefits for our employees:
• Happier, healthier, and more engaged employees;
• which in turn benefits Arcadis and our clients through improved performance, productivity, and 
creativity;
• investment in effective health initiatives by directly addressing employees survey feedback;
• being an employer of choice and Great Place to Work, which allows us to attract and retain Arcadians 
because of our sustained focus.

Our approach to wellbeing embodies a holistic view by encompassing physical, social, and mental health. 
The program itself is harmonized and equitable for all Arcadians, and addresses the following 
components:
• Physical wellbeing as it relates to someone’s ability to perform daily activities free of physical 
limitations, in addition to having enough energy levels to function optimally. 
• Social wellbeing as it relates to social connections, a feeling of purpose and meaning, giving to others 
and being grateful.
• Mental or psychological wellbeing to encourage a state of wellbeing in which every individual realizes 
their own potential and can cope with the normal stresses of life.
Objectives for 2023 and beyond
Our Global H&S objectives for 2023 have been defined to further raise awareness with all employees 
and challenge Arcadis leadership to further increase their stewardship of health and safety. For 2023, 
we expect Arcadis management levels 10 and higher to perform at least one H&S stewardship 
activity per quarter (four annually). We also expect 100% of all staff to perform a documented proactive 
H&S action. We will continue to require that all projects that take place outside of an office environment 
have a well-defined H&S Plan in place before site activities begin. These objectives are bolstered by our 
continued commitment to the mental health and wellbeing of all Arcadians. To that end, all countries will 
be expected to develop implementation plans for the ISO45003 requirements that have been built into 
to the updated Global H&S Management System Standard. 
The six fundamental Health & Safety principles
1 Demonstrate Health & Safety stewardship daily Make sure that you and every member of your  
team goes home safely every day, no matter what your role is in the Company.
2 Use TRACK Apply TRACK every day when planning tasks and before starting any task, and use 
TRACK again when conditions change. Our employees use the TRACK process to: 
Think through the task 
Recognize the hazards 
Assess the risks 
Control the risks 
Keep health & safety first in all things
3 Exercise Stop Work Authority It is your responsibility to stop your own work, the work of other 
Arcadis staff, or work under Arcadis control, if you believe it to be unsafe.
4 Practice 'If Not Me, Then Who?' Be accountable for keeping yourself and others around you safe 
by acting immediately to prevent harm. If you see something unsafe (or not right), say something!
5 Undertake Health & Safety Planning Prepare and maintain a Health & Safety Plan for all work 
activities performed outside of an office environment.
6 Report injuries and incidents immediately Report all incidents, significiant near misses, and unsafe 
acts and conditions immediately so that they can be investigated, corrected to prevent reoccurrence, 
and the lesson learned shared.

The
Impact
The production of battery cells for electric vehicles is critical to support 
the transition to more sustainable mobility solutions. According to 
forecasts, demand from automotive producers in Europe will continue 
to increase over the coming years. This calls for more resilience in the 
manufacturing market: fragile international supply chains require a 
massive increase in regional production capacities across the continent. 
ACC Automotive Cells Co. aims to position itself as the market leader with 
a network of new XXL production sites. One of these gigafactories is to 
be built at the long-established Opel production site in Kaiserslautern, 
Germany. It is a complex large-scale project that requires the best 
available expertise in terms of preparation, planning, approval, execution 
and implementation.
With our unique combination of established local presence and 
international expertise, Arcadis is supporting our client ACC in various 
lifecycle phases of the project. For the site clearance phase, we have 
already provided environmental planning, decontamination, 
deconstruction and permit management services. For the new 
construction, we are leading the Project Management Office (PMO) and 
are responsible for the design and engineering of the entire facility. In 
doing so, we combine the successful experience and excellent knowledge 
that our UK team has built with major Gigafactories across Europe with 
our long-standing knowledge of the regional and national, structural 
and legal framework on sites in Germany.
European mobility history will be written in Kaiserslautern from 2025. 
In the final stage of expansion, enough state-of-the-art battery cells 
will be produced in the new Gigafactory to supply over 600,000 new, 
sustainable electric vehicles every year. Thanks to the intelligent 
conversion of an area on an existing industrial site, the ecological impact 
and the sealing of surfaces will be kept to a minimum. This is a major 
project from which everyone will benefit. It is an important driver for 
the regional economy and local labor market, and a milestone for the 
sustainable mobility revolution, marking a substantial step toward a 
more resilient and independent economic system in Europe.

through the commitments we make in our own 
operations and the end-to-end solutions we 
provide our clients, whether that’s developing 
comprehensive sustainability strategies, or 
turning them into action through practical 
solutions we implement on every project.

Sustainability
2022 has been an important building year for sustainability awareness in our sector: the war in Ukraine 
has brought attention to the importance of energy transition, and recent policies, like the Inflation 
Reduction Act in the US, are making the business case for this important transition easier. At Arcadis, 
we have a specific sustainability ambition: improving quality of life by accelerating the transition to 
net zero. This is our crucial decade. It’s time to accelerate to a better world.
Introduction to our pillars
As shown in the prior GBA sections, Arcadis delivers sustainable solutions via its work in four GBAs. 
To further deliver on our ambition, strengthen our sustainability strategy and grow our internal 
capabilities, Arcadis established a central Global Sustainability team organized into four ‘pillars’ of 
focus described below. These four pillars coordinate activities and foster growth across the business 
to achieve shared goals as described by each pillar.
• Future Focus. Work in FF is concentrating on building thought leadership, researching trends, 
establishing strong industry partnerships, developing delivery approaches within our core services, 
and supporting communities of practice around Global Sustainability’s five key themes. 
• GBA Partners. GBA Partners activities serve the business as sustainability integrators, helping the 
business “embed sustainability in everything we do. ” They advise project teams delivering our core 
services and help scale leading practice across sectors and geographies. 
• Education & Engagement. E&E efforts help Arcadians to understand, apply, and communicate our 
sustainability ambition and capabilities to clients and the industry, developing internal capability-
building and external marketing and community programs that engage and empower all Arcadians.
• Impact & Systems. Work in the I&S area focuses on assessing, measuring and reporting Arcadis’ 
footprint and societal contributions, supporting and maintaining the stakeholder-aligned policies, 
tools, targets, partnerships, and risk and opportunity management frameworks. 
It’s time. Given our origins and the fact that improving quality of life has been at the heart of what we do, 
it is only natural that we would evolve into a company driven by our commitment to maximize our impact 
in creating a more sustainable world. Climate change is the biggest challenge we face, and the built 
environment is fundamental to this, accounting for about 40% of global emissions, central to mitigating 
climate change and to building resilience against climate extremes that are already upon us. 
Sustainability Governance 
At Arcadis, sustainability is at the heart of all our activities. Sustainability is embedded in our 
organizational structure at all levels of the organization. To make sure our strategic direction and 
decisions are clear and aligned to the Arcadis strategy, we have several governance bodies that make 
these decisions and cascade information across our business.
The Supervisory Board has a separate Sustainability Committee (SusCo) . The SusCo, assists and advises 
the Supervisory Board around sustainability. Sustainability is defined as the various Environmental, 
Social, and Governance (ESG) topics that demonstrate or measure the Company’s commitment to 
improving quality of life. The SusCo prepares the plenary discussion and decision-making by the 
Supervisory Board on major items within the Sustainability Committee’s scope of work. The task and 
procedures of the committee is outlined in the committee charter, which can be found on our website. 
The present composition of the Sustainability Committee is included in the Supervisory Board report of 
this Annual Integrated Report.
The Sustainability Program is the responsibility of a Global team led by the Chief Sustainability Officer 
who directly reports to the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) member accountable for Sustainability. 
The Global Sustainability Team is supported by the SusCo, and by the ELT which reviews progress made 
in Arcadis’ sustainability program, drives change management, and provides strategic direction as plans 
and objectives are developed.

Sustainability in Remuneration 
Sustainability is further integrated into our business operations through remuneration programs and in 
financing structures. For the past several years, one third of the variable long-term incentives (LTI) of the 
Executive Board and Executive Leadership Team members has been dependent on a sustainability target 
measured by our score on the Sustainalytics ESG (Risk) Rating. In addition, 20% of the variable short-term 
remuneration (STI) of the Senior Leadership Group depends also on a Sustainalytics target score. 
Sustainalytics is a leading independent global ratings and research firm which provides a robust analytical 
framework that addresses a broad range of ESG issues and trends that have a significant and material 
impact on industries and companies.
In 2022, Arcadis has not issued any new sustainability-linked (or ESG-linked) loans or credit facilities. 
Outstanding throughout 2022 were the ESG-linked EUR 150m Schuldschein (issued in October 2020) and 
the ESG-linked EUR 500m Revolving Credit Facility (refinancing done in October 2021). Both are linked to 
(improving) the Management risk score of Sustainalytics.
By sharing our progress, we stay accountable to ourselves, our clients, our stakeholders, and the rest of 
the world. Arcadis complies with the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD 2014/95/EU) by disclosing 
our business model, and information relating to environmental, social and employee-related matters, 
respect for human rights, anti-corruption and bribery matters.

 “ Monitoring vegetation in the Barmah-Millewa Forest has 
been an incredible experience. It was amazing to play a small 
part in a long-term monitoring project and contribute to a 
better understanding of the sensitive wetland ecosystems, 
which our team is passionate about. ”

How we are different
Leveraging specialist knowledge, digital leadership, 
multidisciplinary collaboration, and stakeholder engagement to 
deliver sustainable solutions.

Gathered crucial data to inform environmental policy and 
management for healthier ecosystems and to safeguard this 
ecologically, culturally, and economically significant area.

The
Impact
The Murray River is the backbone of Australia’s largest River Red Gum 
forests and major wetlands. These wetlands and forests are home to 
35 endangered species and 120 different species of waterbirds. 
Unfortunately, extensive human and industrial activities have disrupted 
natural flooding patterns, compromising the health of the river and the 
surrounding environment. The Living Murray (TLM) program, one of 
Australia’s largest river restoration programs, aims to protect and restore 
biodiversity in complex wetland systems within the Murray Darling Basin 
and deliver cultural outcomes for First Nation peoples.
We collected extensive botanical data across different wetland zones, 
monitoring 72 sites in all four seasons over a two-year period. This 
included water depth, water quality, threats and their impact on the site. 
The project established Arcadis as a digital leader, collecting, processing 
and presenting data in a way that had not been done in the 20 years 
since the program’s inception. The project integrated specialist knowledge, 
digital leadership, and stakeholder engagement with TLM’s requirements. 
Undertaking monitoring during COVID-19 lockdown periods 
demonstrated the team’s dedication to the work and organizational 
ability. The data collected, the information gained, and the 
recommendations made have helped decision makers in refining 
environmental policy to stimulate healthier ecosystems and safeguard 
this significant area from the impacts of climate change.
Tribes of the Yorta Yorta Nation have lived in and around Barmah-Millewa 
Forest for up to 30,000 years. The TLM program is helping to restore 
balance to the system by delivering cultural priorities, returning water to 
the environment, and building water management structures to better 
deliver water to the 37,000 hectares of significant forests, wetlands, 
and lakes along the Murray River. It is working with tourism, recreation, 
forestry and farming industries to improve the river and its floodplains 
to sustainably benefit the Australian community for future generations.

Sustainability
In the coming year, we plan to further embed sustainability into our culture and various client project 
focused processes and systems. This includes our client and project selection process, client account 
planning, project planning and monitoring, standard operating procedures for services to clients, 
capturing project knowledge and sharing outcomes and lessons learned.
Helping clients measure impact and decarbonize their projects
The ‘construction ecosystem’ in which we operate (design, material manufacturing, construction, usage, 
and demolition of buildings and infrastructure) has improved quality of life and enabled societal and 
economic growth across the globe. When considering the global challenges of today, however, how we 
have traditionally developed our societies requires drastic revision if beneficial growth is to continue. 
Today, the built environment represents a significant share of global final energy use, energy related GHG 
emissions, and raw material consumption and is a major contributor to our climate challenges. The 
construction of buildings alone is estimated to be directly or indirectly responsible for almost 40 percent 
of global CO₂ emissions from fuel combustion and 25 percent of GHG emissions overall.
Transitioning the built environment to a net-zero state that maximizes impact is a priority action for 
combatting climate change, and an opportunity for Arcadis to accelerate the transition given our 
market involvement. 
The ‘Arcadis 5 Sustainability Themes’ (Energy & Carbon, Climate Adaption, Circularity, Nature & 
Biodiversity and Societal Impact) serve as the framework through which we align our services and 
solutions to turn to the most pressing emerging and future issues for our clients and support them in 
accelerating their own sustainability journey. The Future Focus team (formerly Client Solutions) within 
Global Sustainability supports Arcadis in articulating the vision for a sustainable future for our business, 
and in doing so helps grow our capability to deliver solutions that solve the most pressing emerging and 
future issues facing our clients.
• Future Focus provides practical, research-led insights on emerging and future sustainability issues, 
which serve as a grounding from which the business can build service/ solutions capability to meet 
client needs ahead of the market.
• Using its subject matter expertise and timely insights, Future Focus provides targeted input into 
strategic pursuits, to enhance our value propositions and support our clients in delivering on their 
own sustainability ambition.
• Future Focus activities provide subject matter input into major business frameworks and processes, 
to improve future sustainability governance and activities in line with our sustainability ambition. 
This includes, but is not limited to: the Innoverse, the Arcadis Way, the Key and Emerging Clients 
Program, Go/No-Go frameworks. 
In 2023 the Future Focus team plans to further embed sustainability into our organization, culture and 
projects through the following major initiatives:
• Map out the long-term sustainability vision for priority solutions, and support capability enhancement 
using these insights.
• Assess project impact across a proportion or all of our 5 Sustainability Themes, in collaboration with 
our Impact and Systems team.
Future Focus
Our client businesses are facing multiple global disruptions today, from geopolitical tensions, energy 
insecurity, and both physical and transitional risks from climate change impact. These challenges, as 
well as having to navigate through a post-pandemic recovery, compel us to look to the future and 
best support our client projects by being aware of emerging and future needs.

Project impact measurement through our ‘Project Carbon’ Initiative
In 2022 Arcadis launched a global initiative ‘Project Carbon’ that aims to embed carbon impact 
measurement into Arcadis building and infrastructure projects, to systematically identify and implement 
decarbonization opportunities for our client projects. Project Carbon brings together Arcadis experts 
from across all GBAs, services and solutions to provide their insights into market and client needs, 
innovation opportunities and position Arcadis as a leader in delivering net zero client solutions.
Asset-level decarbonization solutions 
Our broad range of expertise around the globe enables us to take integrated, holistic approaches to 
decarbonization, from spatial planning to environmental research and green building certifications. 
Across our GBAs and solutions, we support clients to decarbonize their assets, programs, and projects.  
For example, we design, engineer and advise on net zero and decarbonization for facilities, roads, ports, 
buildings, stations, data centers, bridges, tunnels and other assets.
Integrating Arcadis five Sustainability Themes into business operations
We focus on five key themes to embed and standardize sustainability in everything we do. The themes 
were developed from the UN Sustainable Development Goals that we prioritize, continuous stakeholder 
engagement and alignment to our own global business structure.
In 2022 we have further integrated the five sustainability themes into our business and our way of 
working. We developed an ambition level framework to map our clients’ ambition per sustainability theme 
in the client opportunities we track and monitor. Pursuit and growth focused Arcadians can view these 
insights through dashboards. With associated training and guidance, we aim to equip Arcadians to deliver 
sustainable outcomes to clients and better respond and act upon client needs. To reinforce the 
conversations around delivering on the client’s ambition, we also enhanced our project handover and 
review process for our pursuit leaders and project managers.

Education and engagement
To deliver on our ambition of improving quality of life by accelerating the transition to net zero, 
Arcadis recognizes that success will require every employee to have the knowledge, skills, and 
behaviors to proactively deliver through the work we do with our clients, through our partnerships 
and through the community activities that Arcadians regularly take part in.
Sustainability education 
The many education programs at Arcadis enable entry points for all Arcadians to learn and practice 
sustainability. Just a few examples: Since 2020, our Basecamp online digital learning platform has included 
the topic of sustainability, covering sustainability basics from sustainability for clients to the impact of 
urbanization. Our Expedition DNA advanced live training also has sustainability at the core, and in 2022 
over 200 rising leaders were immersed in sustainability and completed a sustainable project through the 
program. City Shapers offers early career professionals at Arcadis the opportunity to solve urbanization 
challenges, and in 2022 sustainability was at the heart with over 100 early career Arcadians developing 
sustainable solutions across 16 cities. And in 2022, Roots of Arcadis - a professional development program 
for young Arcadians – engaged over 250 colleagues with guest speakers on sustainability. 
Thought leadership 
More than half the world’s population live in cities. Accounting for 78% of global energy use and 60% of 
carbon emissions (source: UN), cities present some of the world’s toughest sustainability challenges, and 
the greatest opportunities for change. In 2015, Arcadis launched the first Sustainable Cities Index (SCI). 
This pioneering campaign propelled the issue of urban sustainability onto the mainstream business 
and Government agenda, becoming the landmark comparative measure of sustainability in cities across 
the world. 
Fast forward to 2022, the SCI 2022 is the most successful index to date, with over 800 media mentions, 
and falls under the theme of ‘Prosperity Beyond Profit’ , demonstrating that sustainability and prosperity 
have aligned and are now one and the same. Although prosperity historically meant economic productivity, 
tomorrow’s prosperous cities are those that are looking beyond financial performance to the health of 
their natural environment and their citizens’ quality of life.
Sustainability Partnerships 
Collaboration is key to creating the best and most sustainable solutions. The UN Sustainable 
Development Goal number 17 - ‘Partnerships for Goals’ - supports this belief, which we practice at Arcadis 
through active involvement in several global, regional, and local partnerships in which we collaborate with 
other businesses, governments, NGOs, and societies.
World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)
Arcadis continues its membership with the WBCSD, which it has held since 2014. Our Global CEO, 
Peter Oosterveer continues to serve as an Executive Committee member until March 2023. The position 
is then vacant and will be filled by a new candidate at the next ExCo meeting in June 2023. Our CEO 
nominee will be included on the selection list for vacant positions under consideration as part of the June 
meeting. Arcadis is one of 220 members, who collectively account for 20% of the world’s Greenhouse Gas 
(GHG) emissions. Our membership allows Arcadis to learn, collaborate, and advocate with other global 
organizations for progress on the most pressing sustainability issues for our world. Arcadis sits on the 
WBCSD Built Environment and Mobility Pathway Boards, and in 2022 developed thought leadership on 
Climate Recovery at COP27, EV infrastructure, Healthy People Healthy Business, transition to zero 
emissions framework, nature & biodiversity, H2Zero hydrogen and others.

World Green Building Council (GBC)
Arcadis works with several regional councils within the World Green Building Council network, to foster 
collaboration and advocate for a more sustainable built environment. Regional green building council 
memberships include: 
• U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) 
• U.K. Green Building Council (UKGBC) 
• Dutch Green Building Council (DGBC) 
• Green Building Council of Australia (GBCA)
International Coalition for Sustainable Infrastructure 
In 2019, global engineers came together to identify the biggest barriers to infrastructure climate 
adaptation and resilience and to understand how the engineering community could act as a catalyst 
for action. It culminated in a signed declaration to move forward through a ‘Coalition for Sustainable 
Infrastructure’ (ISCI). In 2022 Arcadis, together with ICSI and the American Society of Civil Engineers 
(ASCE), developed an innovation framework for the promotion of resilient and sustainable infrastructure 
from around the world. This framework is outlined in a report, Pushing the Boundaries of Innovation in 
Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure.
Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure 
Since 2013, Arcadis North America has been a charter member of the Institute for Sustainable 
Infrastructure (ISI). Arcadis uses ISI’s Envision rating system to evaluate the social, environmental, and 
economic benefits of infrastructure such as water, power, and transportation. Hundreds of North 
American employees have completed the ISI Sustainability Professional credentialling. Our partnership 
strengthens our commitment to delivering positive business outcomes to our clients while doing the 
right things for our planet and for society.
UN Habitat 
Since 2010, Arcadis and UN-Habitat have worked together to contribute to one of the most urgent 
challenges in the world: sustainable urbanization. UN-Habitat’s mission is to promote socially and 
environmentally sustainable towns and cities by improving the quality of life of citizens around the world. 
Arcadis supports UN-Habitat in facing these urban challenges through the Shelter Program. 
Together, the two organizations have deployed missions providing technical assistance, and organized 
and implemented the annual Shelter Academy to train over 80 mayors and other key local officials 
from more than 60 cities on climate change mitigation and adaptation measures. In 2022, Arcadis 
supported the Urban Thinkers Campus, held during Urban October, and the World Urban Forum, held 
in Katowice, Poland.
Community engagement
Arcadis and our people dedicate time, expertise, and money in communities around the world to improve 
quality of life. Our volunteer-based activities and projects include: Create Today: providing hands-on 
assistance, such as performing riverside clean ups and organizing charity events to raise money or collect 
goods for those in need; Create Tomorrow: helping local communities by sharing our knowledge and 
experience through consulting, technical advice, financial know-how and access to our extensive network; 
and Create the Future: nurturing future talent through educational programs to promote the positive 
impact our profession can have on the world. 
Local Sparks 
Local Sparks is a global community engagement program where Arcadis employees can lead and 
volunteer in their own community impact initiatives. Since Local Sparks launched in 2019, Arcadians can 
participate in three ways: through the Local Sparks Platform (central hub); the Local Sparks Challenge 
(short-term projects); and the Local Sparks Accelerator (long-term projects). 
In 2022, Local Sparks supported 18 Challenge projects and 8 Accelerator Projects, engaging 150+ 
Arcadians from seven different countries. The 2021-2022 round of Accelerator projects completed this 
year, with 83 Arcadians involved in impacting tens of thousands of local community members through 
projects, ranging from digital services to hands on renovation of community spaces and improving 
communities with sustainable practices. Local Sparks continued to support projects from the COVID-19 
Recovery Program. Three Local Sparks workshops hosted over 300 Arcadians to promote program 
opportunities, with one workshop held in collaboration with the Help Ukraine Task Force and another 
with the KNHM Foundation.

Shelter 
Working in partnership with UN-Habitat, the Arcadis Shelter program is addressing one of the world’s 
most urgent sustainability challenges: urbanization. Since 2010, Arcadians have supported 129 UN-
Habitat projects in more than 30 countries, improving living conditions for some of the world’s most 
vulnerable people. In 2022, 52 Arcadians provided pro-bono expertise to implement primarily virtual 
missions, but we were also able to perform the first in-country mission in almost three years. Eleven 
workshops were held to introduce more than 1,200 Arcadians to the Shelter Program and to share lessons 
learned during missions. 
Ukraine Task Force
At Arcadis, treating all people with dignity and respect is aligned with our company’s core values. 
This means we strive to act and support others suffering hardship or human rights abuse, ultimately 
helping to contribute to a more sustainable, inclusive, and equitable world. 
In response to the war in Ukraine, we established a task force and donated over €1 million to UNICEF, 
Polish Humanitarian Action (PAH) and the Red Cross to raise much needed funds to provide food, water 
and psychological support to the most vulnerable groups. This included elderly people, women, and 
children, who have been displaced or are pinned down in bomb shelters across Ukraine. These 
organizations also provide first aid and medical kits, personal protection gear and other emergency 
humanitarian supplies to these shelters, as well as to hospitals in the combat zones. 
We have seen overwhelming response from Arcadians in Poland, Romania and across the world who are 
showing support to displaced children and families, whether opening their homes or delivering supplies 
to the border, supporting through financial donations or helping to find skilled jobs in our business for 
those whose livelihoods have been violently uprooted by this tragedy. Together, we have expanded our 
refugee hiring and our global Community Engagement programs to support these efforts and the people 
of Ukraine.

Global Sustainability Business Partnering 
To support the business in effectively translating the Arcadis Global Sustainability Strategy into business-specific 
insights, breakthrough targets, and actions plans, the Global Sustainability Business Partners’ activities help 
teams acquire the sustainability knowledge and behaviors necessary to make them effective change agents 
within the industry. Working with key stakeholders in the Growth and Operations teams, the focus is to embed 
sustainability into all client activities – client engagement, bids and projects.
During 2022, and through engagement across the business, the GS BP team have identified immediate 
needs to support client facing and service delivery teams. Collateral has been developed to address these 
immediate needs including a number of ‘How-to Guides’ . For example, ‘How to Start a Sustainability Client 
Conversation’ and ‘How to Integrate Sustainability into a Bid’ . 
 
A key ambition for 2022 was to better define what sustainability means to people in Arcadis, where the 
capability sits, and to identify points of contact. The Growth team had identified a specific need to know 
who to go to for specific sustainability topics. The GS BP team have built a map of the Arcadis 
Sustainability Ecosystem which includes key points of contact for different sustainability themes. 
 
The GS BP team have working closely with the Global Service Directors during 2022 to establish key 
sustainability themes and priorities for each service area. This has included development and facilitation 
of leadership workshops and trainings for groups from Core Service areas and the development of a 
sustainability capability pilot for Project Managers working with clients in the Financial Services sector. 
 
During Q4 2022, the GS BP team worked with the GBAs on an engagement approach for 2023, which will 
improve embedding sustainability in client projects and help GBAs prioritize activities. Sustainability 
Roadmaps for each GBA were developed during Q4 2022 to support engagement.

 “ WELL is an exciting development for our industry, putting the 
emphasis not just on how we create sustainable places that benefit 
the planet, but also benefit those people who use them. ”
Martijn Goossens | WELL accredited professional & design engineer
How we are different
Using the WELL Building Standard to design a place that promotes 
high levels of health and wellbeing, creating optimal conditions for 
students and academics.
Impact
The first WELL certified university building in Europe, aligned to 
the university’s own sustainability aspirations and academic 
research.
1 ,000 students + 20 staff 
benefiting from the new facilities
The
Challenge
The
Solution
The
Impact
Maastricht University is a popular destination for students and scientists 
looking to progress their academic careers. It has been growing for many 
years and now has more than 21,000 students and almost 5,000 staff. But 
to meet future demand the university needed to expand. Acquiring the 
Tapijnkazerne – a neighboring former army barracks – meant there was 
scope to provide much needed capacity for an additional 1,000 students 
and 20 staff, but the site’s aged design and accommodation were not 
consistent with the university’s strategy for sustainability, or their 
aspirations for the student and staff experience. Furthermore, there 
was an appetite from the university to push the boundaries and create 
an exemplar that encapsulated the teaching and research prowess of 
the faculty. 
Our WELL-accredited professionals partnered with the design team and 
contractors to support the implementation and validation of WELL Building 
measures. Given the Tapijnkazerne’s listed status, we had to be sympathetic 
to the original design. For example, modifications were made to improve 
(rather than replace) the original ventilation. This saw 'intelligent' controls 
installed to continuously measure air quality, adjusting to enhance and filter 
air according to the number of people. Light was also a consideration, with 
calculations and daylight simulations prior to construction to optimize 
design and ensure compliance with the highest European standards. Heating, 
ventilation, and air conditioning were designed to focus on ‘thermal comfort’ , 
while sound-limiting interventions were made to aid concentration and 
focus, including sound-insulation to listed windows, and sound mapping to 
create acoustic barriers between zones. 
Maastricht University has become the first university in Europe to meet 
the WELL Building Standard. It is this focus on human sustainability, 
performance and productivity that most closely resonates with the 
Faculty’s own research agenda, supporting their existing staff and

Impact and systems 
Impact and Systems supports embedding ESG considerations into our operations and value 
chain, assesses our own impact, reports on sustainability-related performance and sets global 
policies related to sustainability. In line with our ambition to improve quality of life to accelerate 
the transition to net zero, we are committed to operating our company in a way that reduces 
greenhouse gas and waste emissions in our operations while enhancing biodiversity.
Net Zero Commitment
In September 2021, Arcadis announced a commitment to accelerate reductions to achieve net zero faster 
within the company’s global operations (Scopes 1-3). This step is part of the ambition the company set 
out in its three-year strategy to build on Arcadis’ pioneering heritage and maximize its impact by 
reinforcing sustainability at the heart of client solutions, business operations, and the communities of 
today, tomorrow and the future.
Arcadis supports the aims of the Paris Agreement and Glasgow accords and has committed to reduce 
Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 74% per full time employee by 2035 from a 2019 base year. Arcadis also 
commits to reduce Scope 3 GHG emissions 74% per full time employee by 2035 from a 2019 base, 
focusing on business travel, fuel & energy related activities, commuting and working from home. 
Additionally, Arcadis committed to increase annual sourcing of renewable electricity from 6.8% in 2019 
to 100% in 2022 and achieved that target. In addition, Arcadis sourced renewable electricity certificates 
for the first time covering the electricity consumption of its company-owned/ leased vehicles, employee’s 
private vehicle consumption for business travel and commuting purposes, and for the estimated 
electricity consumption for work from home situations for its employees.
In addition, as an interim step to net zero, we invest in high quality Gold Standard and VCS certified 
offsets for our Scope 1 and 2 emissions and key Scope 3 emissions that protect and restore ecosystems 
in Cambodia and improve quality of life and abate emissions by providing cookstoves in India to help 
mitigate climate change.
To do this, we have established a science-based target for our global operations (Scopes 1-3 emissions) 
with a near-term target aligned with a 1.5°C pathway and a commitment to net zero, approved in 
February by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi), a partnership of four leading NGOs that collectively 
validate organizational greenhouse gas reduction targets. Since then, Arcadis has grown through 
acquisitions and has updated its scope 3 inventory, triggering the need to apply to SBTi for approval 
again in 2023. In addition to the preparedness this will bring our organization regarding adapting to 
and mitigating the effects of climate change, we are confident that the development of our own net zero 
transition plan will also help to maintain and improve our top-quartile performance as ranked by our 
core rating agencies and contribute to key insights we will share with our clients.
Furthermore, we have begun evaluating our own biodiversity footprint and establishing targets related to 
our operations’ impact on biodiversity. Arcadis has joined the Science Based Targets Network Corporate 
Engagement Program, a group of companies, consultants, industry coalitions and financial institutions 
helping the Science Based Targets Network to develop science-based targets for nature. 
At Arcadis we quantify and track our Energy, Climate & Biodiversity KPI by calculating our carbon 
footprint for our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions (MT CO2 per FTE). The target for this KPI aligns with the SBTi 
1.5°C pathway. Our 2022 estimated carbon footprint is presented in the Emissions and Environmental 
Management section of this report. The efforts in place to reduce our emissions are described in the 
section Net Zero Commitment.

The Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary (KSWS) helps restore and protect the home of over 950 wild species, 
including 75 globally threatened species. The project is vital in the preservation of the region’s vulnerable 
wildlife, and the sustainable development of its local communities through securing of legal title to their 
traditional lands. Working with the Fair Climate Fund, Arcadis has been investing in 136,700 of the forest’s 
carbon credits in the past three years (2020-2022), saving approximately 110.5 hectares of protected 
forest land – an important step in our journey to mitigate climate change. The contribution will also 
positively impact Keo Seima’s indigenous people through support in the land titling process, as well as 
sustainable management of the forest, protecting it and its wildlife against the imminent threats of 
deforestation and forest degradation.
Annually our Dutch operations invests in cookstoves, helping families in the India countryside. The project 
saves energy and supports local employment since the ovens are fabricated and serviced locally. Since 
this project is closely related to the carbon footprint of Arcadis, the 2022 investment in cookstoves will be 
determined once the final footprint is published. Please visit our website for updates.
Emissions and Environmental Management 
Since 2010, we have consistently reported on our global emissions and energy consumption, based on 
the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol. This initiative is implemented and monitored via our Global 
Environmental Management System Standard (EMSS). By using this standard, each entity has flexibility 
regarding how to approach their roadmap to achieve their net zero targets and reduce environmental 
impact, but all entities consistently report progress using the Global Standard as a minimum requirement. 
In the Global Standard, Arcadis requires entities to report on metrics that were determined “material” to 
our organization’s environmental impact. For more information refer to the Stakeholder Dialogue section 
in this report. Metrics are compiled globally and summarized herein; additional details are published 
publicly via the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). Carbon footprint data are reported locally to 
sustainability professionals, who review the data. This review includes a comparison to other entities 
and historical performance. Before data is released in our Annual Integrated Report (AIR) it is third party 
verified. Currently, 68% of Arcadis entities run a certified ISO 14001 Environmental Management System 
(EMS); although each entity is required to run an EMS, the system does not have to be certified.
Since the release of our annual report occurs before full year energy consumption data is available, the 
energy consumption and carbon footprint presented in the following tables are estimations based on 
measured data from January to November 2022. The most up to date releases regarding information 
regarding energy consumption and carbon footprint will always be posted on our website. 
The scope 1 and 2, and select scope 3 emissions for 2022 will be offset as soon as we will have finalized 
our full year reporting cycle.

In February 2022, our science-based target was approved by SBTi. Since that time, Arcadis acquired 
several companies (including IBI and DPS). Furthermore, in 2022 we conducted a detailed review of both 
the relevance of all scope 3 categories to our business and our methodologies for calculating relevant 
categories. As a result of this review, we have expanded our inventory to include additional scope 3 
categories to align with leading practice. Due to these changes, we plan to resubmit our GHG reduction 
target to SBTi for approval and have started this process with SBTi.
The companies Arcadis acquired in late 2022 are out of scope for all emission calculations presented here. 
Excluding these acquisitions, we have calculated and are reporting the results for the GHG emissions 
related to scope 3, categories 1, 2 and 5 for the first time. For the preliminary GHG emissions shown here, 
we have calculated these additional scope 3 categories (1, 2, 3, 5 and 7) for the years 2021 and 2019. 
For 2020, we are using the arithmetic average of 2019 and 2021, for 2022 we use actual figures. We will 
publish our final 2022 GHG emissions in Q2 2023 with updated values for both historic as well as 2022 
final figures.
To reduce our electricity-related emissions, we have purchased green electricity via certificates ((i) 
RECs & GOs) for all offices which do not yet have direct green electricity contracts to cover 100% of our 
office electricity consumption. For the first time, we have additionally purchased certificates covering the 
electricity consumption of our electric company-owned/ leased vehicles, electric private vehicles used for 
business travel, as well as for the electricity for working from home (workstations + lighting) and for 
employee commuting with electric vehicles.

For scope 3 category 3 - Fuel-and-energy-related activities (not included in Scope 1 or 2), consumption is 
captured in our NFR platform by each country and calculated according to the mapped emission factors 
(from Defra and IEA, see separate section in glossary). 
For scope 3 category 6 - Business travel, data is collected by an external provider, Thrust Carbon, directly 
from our travel agencies, and in cases where travel is not booked via these providers either data is 
completed using local reporting tools or via estimates. Business travel includes emissions from private 
vehicles, air travel, public transportation, rental/ hired vehicles, and taxis.
For scope 3 category 7 - Employee commuting incl. working from home (WFH), data was collected via a 
global employee survey (overall response rate of 31% that was scaled based on headcount). Then, 
emissions were calculated outside our NFR platform using the same Defra emission factors for employee 
commuting by transportation type and fuel type. For WFH emissions, we calculated the average WFH 
days per country from our survey data and applied the country-specific emission factors by Ecometrica. 
Ecometrica provides factors for emissions per homeworker-day from their global homeworker model 
(https://ecometrica.com/knowledge-bank/insights/the-ecometrica-homeworker-methodology).
For our scope 1 and 2, consumption is captured in our NFR platform by each country and calculated 
according to the mapped emission factors from Defra v11 (09/2022) and IEA v5 (12/2022), see separate 
section in glossary.
Our US electricity-related emissions had been calculated using prior Defra factors which still represented 
the US grid mix of the year 2015. This has been updated for our 2021 and 2022 scope 2 values with the 
newest available factors from IEA v5 (12/2022) which represent the US grid mix of the year 2020. This 
update affected only our scope 2 (location-based) figures, which are now 21% lower (for 2022) and 26% 
lower (for 2021).

Since 2017, Arcadis has participated in KLM’s Corporate Biofuel program. Through this program, Arcadis 
pays a surcharge to the airline that covers the cost difference between sustainable biofuel and traditional 
kerosene. A large-scale shift to sustainable biofuel has the potential to decrease carbon emissions from 
the airline industry by up to 80%. Participating in this program helps us demonstrate demand for more 
sustainable business travel options.
Detailed methodology
Addition to our indirect emissions (scope 3): For the first time we are reporting emissions for scope 3 
category 1 (Purchased goods and services), category 2 (Capital goods) and category 5 (Waste generated 
in operations). We have used a spend-based methodology and EEIO factors to calculate these emissions 
and the spend data was provided by our Finance function.

Arcadis divested a few countries’ operations, and where no data could be retrieved because of the 
divestment, missing data was completed with the average of the previous months of 2022 if available or 
else with the arithmetic average of the whole year 2021. 
For our global KPIs, absolute emissions have been divided by the FTEs to calculate the intensity figures 
(GHG emissions per FTE).
Pledge to Race to Zero
To further reiterate our commitment to becoming a Net Zero company, Arcadis continues to participate 
in the Pledge to Net Zero. Through this commitment, we joined the Race to Zero, a UN backed global 
campaign aimed to rally leadership and support from businesses, cities, regions, investors to take action 
to shift to a decarbonized economy that prevents future threats, creates jobs, and unlocks inclusive, 
sustainable growth.
Ratings and Recognition 
In line with our Global Sustainability Policy, Arcadis measures, monitors, and communicates its 
sustainability performance in a manner that is transparent and responsive to the needs of stakeholders. 
Progress is reflected in several Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance benchmarks 
and assessments, including Sustainalytics, CDP, MSCI, ISS and EcoVadis. We take a pro-active approach 
in disclosing our policies, programs, actions and results. We welcome feedback from these ESG rating 
agencies on our journey to continuously improve and maximize our positive impact to society, through 
the projects we undertake for our clients, in our own business operations and through the way we engage

Sustainable procurement 
Responsible and sustainable procurement has been recognized as a material theme for Arcadis.
We are further developing our Sustainable Procurement Program and building an impact-based 
approach. In 2022, these developments included, but were not limited to:
• A small-scale Supplier Sustainability Collaboration Pilot as a basis for larger scale collaborations. 
This pilot paved the path to larger scale deep diving on points 2 and 3.
• Reviewing and reducing our greenhouse gas impact through our supply base. Further development of 
our Scope 3 analysis, reporting, and reduction focuses on purchased goods and services. A Supplier 
Collaboration program on reduction of our Scope 3 impact is being developed1. 
• Growing our phased Human Rights approach based on our Human Rights policy and roadmap 
addresses the supply chain in alignment with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and 
Human Rights.
• Risk assessments on procurement category level help us identify possible environmental and human 
rights risks. Measures for risk mitigation include: 
 – internal training of our (procurement) community for higher awareness; 
 – engagement of AI-monitoring services help us to trace potential non compliances in our supply base; 
 – the extension for suppliers to raise concerns through an Integrity Line.
Training of our international procurement community to familiarize key stakeholders in this community 
with external sustainability developments and internal tools. 
 
Core principles that guide Arcadis’ Sustainable Procurement practices are represented in our publicly 
available Arcadis Global Procurement Policy Statement and the Arcadis Global Supplier Code of Conduct, 
which outlines the collaborative approach we aim for with our supply base. It also details Arcadis’ 
expectations that suppliers need to meet regarding ESG topics. 
To strengthen our approach, we follow ISO20400 guidelines for the planning and implementation of 
sustainable procurement and the Arcadis Risk & Control framework regarding Third Party Management 
includes internal guidelines to engage with suppliers.

The
Impact
Western Sydney’s diverse population of more than two million is expected 
to increase by 46% over the next 20 years. To accommodate for future 
growth and the region’s rising aviation needs, the Western Sydney 
International Airport is set to deliver simple, smart, and intuitive 
experience for travelers and be a catalyst for long-term development, 
opening up new employment and economic opportunities in the 
Western Sydney corridor. Opening in 2026, this is the first new greenfield 
international airport in Australia since Melbourne Airport opened in 1970.
Arcadis is bringing technical expertise and knowledge from Australia 
and globally. The construction of the project is split into several major 
contracts. Arcadis was involved in the Bulk Earthworks contract as part 
of CPB Contractors and Acciona Joint Venture, which is the first major 
package for construction. Following the success of our initial work, we 
continued to provide cutting-edge detailed design in a Joint Venture with 
Aurecon and partner NACO for the Airside Civil and Pavement works that 
form the foundation of the new airport. To achieve our sustainability and 
environmental targets, Arcadis was instrumental in developing pavement 
materials made using recycled materials. Digital engineering is a vital 
component. Federating various 3D models, which is unique for this 
project, saves significant processing time, reduces risks, and mitigates 
errors, helping to improve quality and safety. 
As the detailed designer, together with our JV partner, Arcadis is 
completing the cutting-edge detailed design of the airside package, 
including the runway, roads, taxiways, pavement, utilities, and water 
systems. Western Sydney International Airport will provide a seamless 
experience for passengers thanks to smart technologies and services. 
Focusing on operational efficiency and reliability makes flying fast, easy, 
and smooth. Aside from opening thousands of employment and business 
opportunities for locals in the Western Sydney corridor, the airport will 
also stimulate the development of new and modern infrastructure, such 
as motorways, train lines, and roads, shortening travel time and increasing 
safety for generations to come.

Disclosures related to environmental matters
Our progress is reflected in several Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance 
benchmarks, including Sustainalytics, CDP, MSCI, ISS and EcoVadis. We take a pro-active approach in 
disclosing our policies, programs, actions and results. We welcome feedback from these ESG rating 
agencies on our journey to continuously improve and maximize our positive impact to society, through 
the projects we undertake for our clients, in our own business operations and through the way we engage 
with people and communities.
Environmental non-compliance
Our efforts in sustainability are guided by the UN Sustainable Development Goals and by the
Arcadis General Business Principles (AGBP) which set guidance for our business decisions and actions
throughout the world at all levels and apply equally to company actions and to individual behavior of
all our employees in conducting Arcadis’ business.
In 2022 there has been no environmental violation or notice of violation from a regulatory environmental 
authority where a monetary civil penalty of an amount higher than €10 K was imposed on Arcadis.
Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)
TCFD disclosures assess the risk and opportunities for Arcadis related to climate change. In 2022, we 
carried out both qualitative and quantitative Climate Scenario Analysis (CSA). The CSA outputs have 
helped us to assess climate-related physical and transition risks and opportunities for the business. The 
insights generated from the CSA will help us set a course of actions for next year. The complete TCFD 
disclosure is presented in the section Additional Information at the end of this report.
In line with our Global Sustainability Policy, we measure, monitor, and communicate our sustainability 
performance in a manner that is transparent and responsive to the needs of our stakeholders. 
Arcadis EU taxonomy disclosure
Context
According to the Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (the “Taxonomy Regulation”), Arcadis is subject to disclosing 
the share of its economic activities, for the period ending on 31 December 2022, in terms of sales revenue, 
capital expenditures and operational expenditures that are taxonomy eligible and taxonomy aligned 
under at least one of the two published environmental objectives defined by the European Commission. 
Today, the two published environmental objectives are the climate change mitigation and climate change 
adaptation objectives. In the future, the disclosures will be extended to cover all the six environmental 
objectives. According to the EU Commission, today's criteria cover the economic activities of roughly 40% 
of EU-domiciled listed companies, in sectors which are responsible for almost 80% of direct greenhouse 
gas emissions in Europe.
An economic activity is taxonomy eligible if it is part of the list of activities described by the Delegated 
Acts to the Taxonomy Regulation, corresponding to the activities identified by the European Commission 
as likely to substantially contribute to one of the following environmental objectives: 
• Climate change mitigation
• Climate change adaptation
• Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources
• Transition to a circular economy
• Pollution prevention and control
• Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems

An economic activity is qualified as taxonomy aligned where that activity:
• Substantially contributes to one or more environmental objectives, by meeting the specific technical 
criteria detailed in the Delegated Acts to the Taxonomy regulation;
• Does not cause any significant harm to the other environmental objectives, meeting the applicable 
“Do No Significant Harm” criteria described in the Delegated Acts to the Taxonomy regulation;
• is carried out in accordance with minimum safeguards and complies with the OECD Guidelines for 
Multinational Enterprises and UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights including the 
principles and rights set out in the eight fundamental conventions identified in the Declaration of the 
International Labour Organisation on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the International 
Bill of Human Rights.  
31 December 2022 reporting
Eligible activities
Arcadis conducted a detailed analysis of its activities to identify those that correspond to activities 
described in the two published Delegated Acts around climate change mitigation and climate change 
adaptation. 
This analysis was carried out jointly by the Global Accounting Officer responsible for the disclosure of the 
annual integrated report, the Global Growth Finance Director of GBA Mobility, and the Non-Financial 
Reporting Director. 
Eligibility Assessment Methodology
Arcadis, being one of the world's leading companies delivering sustainable design, engineering, and 
consultancy solutions for natural and built assets, has an important place in the value chain. Arcadis’ 
services enable other companies to be more sustainable, as in the example of construction or 
maintenance works. Since Arcadis is almost never engaged in the latter activities, the actual list of 
relevant taxonomy activities to Arcadis is very narrow. It is important to note that although Arcadis is 
having Sustainability in the core of their strategy, many of the advisory activities such as Project and 
Program management, Design and Engineering, Contract Solutions, Commercial and Procurement 
strategies, and many more do not fit in the EU Taxonomy, as Arcadis does not carry out the actual 
construction works.
Though Arcadis’ designs and plans are key to determining whether the environmental objectives are likely 
to be achieved for its clients, due to Taxonomy eligibility requirements, this work often does not accrue 
under the final eligible economic activity totals. 
Arcadis classifies its value propositions through Solutions. At project start, projects are tagged in the ERP 
system which allows categorization of each project by Global Business Area, by Solution, and or by type of 
Service. Each Solution at Arcadis has been screened in joint efforts with the Solution leaders, in order to 
identify possible eligible activities. Where necessary, further detailed analysis took place with help of e.g. 
project managers, finance staff and other relevant stakeholders. Each Solution in which eligible activities 
were found, is briefly explained below. 
Rail Solutions 
All projects under the Intelligent Rail Solutions are mostly Design & Engineering (D&E) projects for 
railways, subways, bridges, tunnels, stations, terminals, or rail service facilities. The total turnover 
associated with the list of projects inside this Solution is found eligible under activity “6.14 Infrastructure 
for rail transport” in the Climate Mitigation objective. No CAPEX nor OPEX (according to the taxonomy 
definitions) dedicated to Intelligent Rail projects have been identified.

The Climate Adaptation Solution ensures communities continue to thrive in the face of climate 
uncertainty by providing full climate adaptation measures across the life-cycle of any asset – from risk 
mapping, vulnerability assessments, and community-based resilience plans to the design and engineering 
of flood defense systems and stormwater infrastructure. The Solution works with framework contracts, 
that often have a time horizon over several years and cover a wide variety of technical consultancy 
services, which are all dedicated to adaptation to climate change, making the Solution eligible under 
activity “9.1 - Engineering activities and related technical consultancy dedicated to adaptation to climate 
change” in the Climate Adaptation objective. No CAPEX nor OPEX (according to the taxonomy 
definitions) dedicated to Climate Adaptation projects have been identified. 
Environmental Restoration Solution 
A comprehensive assessment of projects under “Environmental Restoration” Solution have been 
performed against descriptions of several taxonomy activities. The assessment led to identifying 
two eligible projects relating to the improvement of wetland functions located on land matching 
the international definition of wetland under activity “2.1 Wetland Restoration” . No CAPEX nor OPEX 
(according to the taxonomy definitions) dedicated to Environmental Restoration Solution projects have 
been identified. 
Net Zero Facilities & Sustainable Communities Solution 
Assessment of the “Net Zero Facilities & Sustainable Communities” Solution have led to confirming the 
eligibility of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) projects. All MEP projects fall under technical 
consultations (energy consultations, energy simulations, project management, production of energy 
performance contracts, dedicated trainings) linked to the improvement of energy performance of 
buildings and thus are eligible under activity “9.3 Professional services related to energy performance 
of buildings” in the Climate mitigation objective. No CAPEX nor OPEX (according to the taxonomy 
definitions) associated with MEP projects have been identified.
Non eligible activities
• Non-Eligible Activities
• The assessment covered all the Solutions with likely eligible activities generating Turn Over (TO) or 
engaging a CAPEX or OPEX. No further taxonomy eligible activities have been identified. 
Individual Measures 
Our eligibility screening has covered individual measures involving TO, CAPEX, or OPEX and that are 
rather managed at group level. The assessment has led to identifying activities “6.5 Transport by 
motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles” and “7.7 Acquisition and ownership of 
buildings” . Leased vehicles accounted for under IFRS 16, as well as all KPIs related to leased buildings 
are eligible. 
Recent acquisitions
Arcadis has acquired companies during 2022, notably IBI Group, September the 27th and DPS Group 
December the 1st. IBI and DPS revenues, OPEX and CAPEX are included in the denominator of the 
calculations for Eligibility and Alignment. IBI and DPS leased assets have been identified as eligible and 
included in the numerator of the CAPEX KPI. Turnover of acquisitions could not be reviewed in the short 
period of time, in result is considered not eligible. Aside from that, turnover of acquisitions in the months 
being part of Arcadis was not having material impact on the total revenue of Arcadis. No material impact 
on the eligible turnover nor the eligible OPEX was identified in relation with these acquisitions. In 2023 an 
in-depth review of their activities will be done to assess whether they should be considered as eligible.

Analysis of the alignment of the activities
A thorough analysis of the technical screening criteria has been performed for all eligible activities based 
on a comprehensive data analysis covering all concerned projects. The assessment involved Solution 
leaders, country controllers, and project managers overseeing eligible projects. All substantial criteria, 
alongside DNSH criteria listed in Annex 1 of the EU Regulation 2021/2139 were examined for all eligible 
activities.
(6.14) Infrastructure for rail transport
All substantial criteria have been examined, while DNSH criteria related to circular economy and pollution 
have been judged non-applicable for activity (6.14) given that Arcadis is a Design & Engineering firm never 
involved in actual works. Arcadis, consequently, does no significant harm to the transition to a circular 
economy nor to pollution prevention and control. 
(9.1) Climate Adaptation
All activities in this business were screened against the substantial contribution criteria and were found to 
be in line with all alignment requirements, since the main purpose of this solution is to offer nature-based 
solutions, such as flood prevention, restoration of biodiversity loss and integration of green areas in cities, 
to adapt to climate change in densely populated and affected areas. Only one criterion concerning 
architectural services was considered as “non applicable” , since no projects offer services in architecture. 
In addition to being key parts of the design process, all projects respect stringent local regulations on 
environmental impact assessments and water quality assessments, as required by DNSH 3 (Sustainable 
use and protection of water and marine resources).
(9.3) Professional services related to energy performance of buildings 
All MEP projects in Arcadis involve technical consultations (energy simulations, & project management) 
linked to the improvement of energy performance of buildings. For activity (9.3), according to (Annex 1) of 
the EU Taxonomy, all DNSH criteria are non-applicable except for the Climate Change Adaptation. 
(7.7) Acquisition and ownership of buildings
For buildings to demonstrate compliance with the substantial contribution criteria, adequate evidence 
was examined to prove that the buildings have at least an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) class A, 
or as an alternative that they are within the top 15% of the national or regional stock. For projects based 
outside the EU, and for EU countries with no solid national classification, the analysis was based by using 
the French threshold. For activity (7.7), according to (Annex 1) of the EU Taxonomy, all DNSH criteria are 
non-applicable except for the Climate Change Adaptation.
(6.5) Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles
All leased fleet vehicles with CO2 emissions lower than 50kgCO2/km (electric and hybrid (PHEV) vehicles) 
were considered meeting the substantial contribution criteria. Screening of the circular economy DNSH 
was conducted regarding end of life use and waste management, while all European vehicles are 
compliant with EU directives regarding eco-design and pollution prevention. 
Adaptation to the climate change
A climate risk and vulnerability assessment has been performed to assess the materiality of the physical 
climate risks on the Arcadis’ activities. The assessment covers Arcadis’ assets located in all countries. 
Climate perils are classified by level of sensitivity based on scientifically calculated hazard scores, and 
displayed by number of impacted employees, and by impacted project net revenues. An assessment of 
adaptation solutions that can reduce the identified physical climate risk has been performed. Arcadis is 
not considered as vulnerable to the climate change hazards as the activity is spread in a wide variety of 
geographies, allowing a risk diversification. Furthermore, home office and remote working is easy to put in 
place in case of a climatic hazard. It has been conclude that DNSH2 is respected over all Arcadis’ activities.

Non-Financial reporting
Delivering on our sustainability purpose and commitments, requires that we continuously improve our 
Non-Financial Reporting capabilities. 
A program has been set up for that with focus on improving the integral governance over non-financial 
reporting, as well as introducing a global sustainability data management platform. 
Towards 2023, the program is continuing to improve timing and quality of reporting, as well will have the 
focus on further implementation of EU Taxonomy as well as new and upcoming legislation such as CSRD. 
The focus of the program will also cover the selection of non-financial KPI’s and metrics. These KPI’s 
should fully fit into our sustainability targets to be defined in our new 3-year strategic cycle, that in its 
turn will be based on the updated materiality analysis.

Our objective is to create value by optimizing existing technology, partnering with best-in-class technology 
companies, investing in start-ups and being curious about technology advancements. We deliver value to our 
clients through collaboration and the strong relationships between our technology experts, subject matter 
experts, innovation practitioners and chosen partners. We invest to enhance the skills of Arcadians, empowering 
them to create enduring solutions that leverage the best technology that meet our client's greatest challenges.
Delivering on Innovation & Ecosystems mission
Our 2022 mission was to develop and launch new digital solutions into the market and to establish new 
ecosystem partnerships that deliver value to Arcadis clients. Throughout 2022 we explored some of the 
most pressing challenges our clients are facing, we implemented agile methodology to validate and 
rapidly test those business ideas and creating minimum viable products. We developed our ecosystem 
partnerships, leveraging Arcadis’s technical know-how and investing in the development of innovation 
skills that has led to the launch of new digital solutions.
Progess made in 2022
In 2022 we sharpened our focus on where we invested our time and resources while continuing to be a 
digital leader and push the boundaries of our solutions. The Global Innovation and Ecosystems team has 
worked with each Global Business Area on key projects that focus on digitalization and the development 
of new solutions and new business models, including Software as a Service. 
1.  Optimize: We continued the digitalization of our global services and solutions, standardizing and 
automating across our core service areas of Design and Engineering, Program and Project 
Management, Environmental Services, Cost and Commercial Management and Asset Management. 
To better leverage our development resources and maximize return on investment, Arcadis

The Challenge
Large (infrastructure) projects with high information, organizational and stakeholder landscapes 
complexities , demonstrate a high risk of failing to meet clients’ expectations. This is often caused 
by unclear scope definition, lack of demonstrable assurance and misalignment with desired project 
end goals.
The Solution 
With Systematic Assurance (SA), Arcadis has a proven and scalable solution for MBSE, that uses 
linked-data technology and open-source information exchange, differentiating it from other solutions 
in the market and supports information exchange within the supply chain.SA MBSE is a design 
methodology and process, supported by tooling that provides a single source of truth for all project 
stakeholders, accessible through a user friendly and online platform.
The Impact
• Increased Project Margin through increased efficiency
• Client satisfaction increase, reduction of rework
• Sales differentiator (in US and Australia) 
Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)
The Challenge
Lack of a centralized way to manage the development, storage and monitoring the usage of automation
scripts for design and engineering modelling. 
The Solution
A centralised cross GBA Design & Engineering operations portal that will capture and show regularly
what design automations are being used by the business and have a means to correlate this to real
world project resourcing, and relative to D&E project revenues. 
The Impact
• Understanding of available automation tools and experience lead to efficiency
• Cost savings will increase project margin
• Improve client experience

proactive asset management through a new digital solution. 
The Challenge
Due to the ineffectiveness and cost of current technologies and methodologies, bridge owners and
operators struggle to inspect their assets frequently enough, which sometimes results in fatalities,
network disruptions and costly damages.
The Solution
We help asset owners to avoid bridges failure by proposing an efficient and non-invasive inspection and
defect detection. We use new technologies like drones combined with AI technologies, automation and
Arcadis' expertise which leads to an integrated Asset Management service.
The Impact
We help our clients to reduce the number of injuries and fatalities, and disruptions in the transport
network, while increasing the efficiency of inspection, data collection, opex and capex for asset owners.

Asset Generator (AG) 
Capital planning and early design stage processes are often inefficient and complex resulting in 
additional time to deliver outcomes and additional risk. Asset Generator is a Web/Cloud based tool to 
develop built asset masterplan layouts and imagery. This automated design tool will speed up the 
design process and developing planning documents. You can upload your own files from your local 
storage or from another BIM360 site or you can design your own asset by uploading a standardized 
design spreadsheet to the AG site, which uses Autodesk’s cloud-based tools. This file can then be 
modified as the design progresses towards completion.
 
 
Accelerate through Ecosystem Partnerships 
When we create new solutions for our clients it is very rare that we can deliver an end-to-end solution as a 
single organisation. Understanding where innovation is happening, where new start-ups are forming and 
where we can co-create value with our clients and our peers help us to focus on the right organisations to 
partner with. In 2022 we have formed new partnerships that have accelerated the development, launch 
and scaling of digital solutions and the enhancement of some existing solutions.
Object Type Library (OTL) 
Customers use varying definitions for assets as well as hierarchy of objects when designing projects. 
This can create ambiguity in project information, hinders collaboration and increases cost during 
project delivery. To help we have created Object Type Libraries (OTLs) for key asset types. By doing so, 
structuring project data, ensuring consistency of information and being able to reuse data and design 
specifications. The impact is improved project margins through increased efficiency, connection 
between design, cost, and sustainability and the ability to capture valuable benchmark data throughout 
the life cycle.
 
 
Building on our strong relationship with Microsoft, we engaged in the Microsoft Customer as a Partner 
program. In 2022, this has delivered several benefits. Microsoft validated our approach to innovation and 
provided positive feedback as well as coaching on areas for improvement. We were able to test and 
validate some of our projects in incubation and further explore different business models and 
commercial strategies. Specifically, we used this program to aid the development of a new digital twin 
solution that has enabled us to test and open new channels to market.
Explore, test, launch, scale: new Digital Solutions for clients
Creating new digital solutions through business model innovation is challenging, not least because of the 
sheer complexity, diversity, and variability of the challenges that we help our clients to solve. In 2022, we 
have continued to explore new opportunities for business model innovation whilst focusing on 
operationalizing and scaling digital solutions created in 2021.
Smart DD 
To enhance our leading position in transaction advisory, Arcadis has developed a new digital platform 
called Smart DD to support the delivery of technical due diligence services. This helps to mitigate 
transaction risks and identify value creation opportunities for our real estate investor clients. From 
single assets to large portfolio acquisitions, the Smart DD platform provides clients with a consistent 
experience, able to accommodate commissions involving multiple geographies and assets. This enables 
teams to deliver more efficiently and meet timescales. The platform was launched in 2022 and 
expected to support 1,500 transactions pa with a target of 3,700 transactions once three new modules 
are launched in 2023.

Transport Strategy Optimizer (TSO) 
Our mobility clients face many challenges, from climate change to safety. They look for a way to 
balance these complex goals with budget to identify the appropriate investment priorities. Arcadis has 
launched an innovative AI-solution called Transport Strategy Optimizer which helps our clients to 
prioritize their investments while allowing a more collaborative decision-making process. This is 
available as a SaaS product, as well as an integrated part of Arcadis’s solutions. In 2022, two pilots have 
been run in the UK, and the tool is now being used to help Birmingham City Council develop their local 
transport plan.
 
 
Investment in Digital Twins: A New Solution for Non-Revenue Water 
Non-revenue water loss is a persistent problem in municipal water. The need to better manage – 
including identifying and solving non-revenue water loss – is critical in a water constrained environment. 
We have developed a digital twin proof of concept to reduce water leakage, resulting in lower customer 
charges, less use of chemicals and a reduction in water and energy use. Our solution can identify leaks 
to support in the reduction of lost water. Based on a Microsoft Azure platform, we have created several 
algorithms that ingest data from multiple sensors, hydraulic and network models to identify leakage. 
The outcome will be more clean water reaching those who need it, better understanding of measures 
to reduce leakage for water companies. 
 
 
Developing and scaling Field Now®
In 2021, we launched FieldNow – an electronic tool to collect field data. In 2022, we have added new 
features to enable greater adoption into Arcadis projects. Work has been completed to create new 
modules (e.g. soil and sediment sampling) which have accelerated our ability to build end-to end 
workflows, including our digital site characterization solution which streamlines the delivery of PFAS 
remedial investigations. Over 50 projects were onboarded to our new FieldNow® solutions in 2022. 
 
 
Our model for Innovation and Digital Investments 
In 2022, we matured our governance model for Innovation and Digital Investments. We introduced 
The Innoverse to replace Quick Launch as our Innovation Framework to source ideas and opportunities, 
channel ideas to the right decision makers, enable transparent tracking of ideas and opportunities and 
communicate the status at any given point in time. Through The Innoverse we enable different types 
of innovation:

Delivery through Agile
For the creation of new digital solutions, we introduced Agile Principles & Methodology to enable faster 
decision making and greater autonomy to the Global Business Areas. Agile has enabled us to create new 
ideas and respond to change. It provides us with a way of dealing with, and ultimately succeeding, in an 
uncertain and turbulent environment. We follow established methodologies, such as Scrum, to drive 
our automation and digitalization efforts. Agile creates a paradigm shift compared to the traditional 
waterfall approach.
  
During 2022, we created a community for Agilists across the organization, with over 200 members joining. 
We created a Product Owner Community of Practice with over 100 members. This community is focused 
on practical, hands-on training to improve how we deliver in our product-focused roles. We were able to 
share how we have successfully used them when developing products.
1 As not all projects can be executed in a BIM environment, and because of the type of work or client demands, 100% is not achievable
Delivering on our Technology mission
Our 2022 Technology mission was to provide effective technology that empowers Arcadians to deliver 
high value services and solutions to our clients, that will ensure that Arcadis thrives in an increasingly 
digitally driven business environment. Throughout 2022 we have transformed our classic IT support 
organization into a Global Technology team that drives the digital transformation of Arcadis by creating 
value through technology. 
Digitization
In 2021, 78% of our Design & Engineering projects used BIM (Level 2) to deliver projects for our clients, 
demonstrating close to complete digitization of our professional delivery processes1. In 2022 the focus 
switched away from measuring percentage use of BIM and towards Standardization and Automation.
IT Service Management
In 2022 we implemented a new, industry-leading IT Service Management system called ‘Helix’ . This will 
improve the automated management of our IT environment, improving operational excellence and 
decreasing risks. Helix is expected to free up our IT support staff allowing them to improve support to 
our staff, resulting in higher productivity and decreased operational risks. In 2023 we will focus on the 
continued automation of our support and services and broaden the use of Helix beyond Technology.
Citizen Development
According to Gartner, the use of low- and no code platforms for rapid application development or high 
productivity development, will grow significantly in coming years. This is driven by the shortage of 
professional developers and the increased accessibility and power of low- and no code platforms. In a 
project-based organization like Arcadis, these platforms will deliver even more value as they provide an 
alternative for the automation of specific project-based client-needs which are difficult to automate with 
professional scalable solutions. There for we formalized this approach in our Citizen Development 
program to accelerate the value creation in our projects.

Digital leadership
To help accelerate the use of low- and no code platforms in a safe way, we provided targeted training to 
40 key Citizen Developers in 2022. We also organized a low-code hackathon, established a core support 
team, and established an easy-to-understand engagement model to help the business understand when 
Citizen Development is appropriate and when professional development or a fusion team approach 
(business working together with technology experts in one team) is needed. 
Cloud
In 2022 Arcadis transitioned most of its IT Infrastructure to the cloud (both networking and hosting). 
This increased the scalability of our global IT infrastructure for both core IT services and SaaS products. 
The largest portion of our infrastructure costs are now allocated on a “pay-as-you-go” basis. We started 
to automate the provisioning of development environments including DevOps tooling like automated 
testing on Cyber security which will further increase the scalability of our solutions.
ERP Implementation 
To be able to operate as a global company, we are streamlining our ERP environment on a global scale. 
In 2022, we migrated Continental Europe and the GEC’s to Oracle Cloud. We also completed 10 major 
enhancements (implementation of organizational changes or new modules). With this, the Oracle 
implementations are nearing completion and we will start to increase focus on improving Oracle 
performance and user experience. In line with this intent, we finalized more than 1,500 minor 
improvements in 2022 which resulted in a 47% reduction of IT tickets over those submitted in 2022. 
Information Security 
The increase of digitalization implies an increase of cyber risk: the more we depend on information 
technology and industrial control systems, the more impact it has on our organization and our clients 
when these systems are not available or do not work properly. For this reason, we have further invested in 
Information Security in 2022. 
We strengthened our security incident response capabilities, so we are able to react more quickly when an 
incident occurs and limit the potential impact. We continued to improve our capabilities to identify and 
detect risks and anomalies in line with industry standards and we executed cyber-attack exercises to test 
our detection and response capabilities. In 2022 we paid special attention to educate all our people across 
the world to recognize phishing emails and other malicious attempts and make sure they understand how 
to respond.
We were able to renew our ISO27001 and Cyber Essential Plus certifications in 2022 and prepared to 
expand the scope of these security certifications in 2023.

 “ When it comes to selecting projects for offsetting, additionality 
is key. This means focusing on projects where we can be sure the 
investment will make a significant difference. ”
José Neto | Environmental coordinator
How we are different
Detailed, early assessment of carbon offset projects in line with 
international standards supports better decision-making.
Impact
Chosen projects will be those that have maximum impact when it 
comes to preserving biodiversity and reducing the impact of 
climate change.

The
Impact
Carbon credits are an important mechanism in the drive to reduce 
harmful greenhouse gases. For companies whose goal is to reduce overall 
carbon emissions, an offset program can be a vital element and key 
interim step on the path towards net zero. This was the case for our client; 
who was looking for certified and globally recognized projects that would 
make the most difference. The focus was the Amazon; the world’s largest 
tropical rainforest and home to more than 10% of the planet’s 
biodiversity. Arcadis was tasked with assessing the feasibility of 
implementing different types of AFOLU (Agriculture, Forests and other 
land use) offsetting projects in the region, based on forest preservation 
and the recovery of degraded areas and ensuring projects were selected 
in line with internationally accepted standards. 
We began by evaluating three options for carbon credit projects that 
could be developed in the region: i) Avoiding Planned Deforestation 
and/ or Degradation (APDD); ii) Avoiding Unplanned Deforestation 
and/ or Degradation (AUDD) and iii) Afforestation, Reforestation and 
Revegetation (ARR). When selecting a project, it’s important providers 
adhere to either the Gold Standard, Verified Carbon Standard 
(VCS)/ VERRA, or similar REDD+ local standards. This means we can be 
sure the kind of projects selected to be developed will also benefit local 
populations. We therefore deepened our analysis in line with VC/ VERRA, 
reviewing 14 methodologies that could be linked to the three project 
options before carrying out a strategic analysis to define which would 
best meet the client’s objectives. 
Our analysis enabled us to table all the requirements the client needed 
to consider when choosing carbon credit projects, including a matrix 
weighing the different project options and any associated risks. In this way, 
we have been able to support our client in making an informed decision 
about which carbon offsetting projects they should pursue. The result is 
not only the preservation of vital biodiversity in the region, but we have 
also given our client peace of mind that they have done everything 
possible to ensure their investment will have maximum positive impact 
in the region.

We have also made significant progress in optimizing our portfolio and focusing our efforts on 
geographies where we see the most attractive opportunities. This has resulted in the divestments of 
operations in Thailand, Czech Republic, Slovakia. Singapore, Malaysia, our Design and Engineering 
business in Hong Kong, Switzerland and our environmental restoration business in France. 
With the integration of our acquisitions well underway we are not only on track to extract cost synergies, 
but are also seeing many new opportunities to better serve our clients, including from our enhanced 
architecture and urbanism offering within the Places GBA, our new process technology advisory and clean 
room capabilities from DPS and our recently launched fourth GBA Intelligence. With the continued strong 
client demand we are experiencing combined with the pipeline of private and public sector opportunities 
and our financial discipline, we are on track to deliver on our strategic targets in 2023.
Financial performance 2022:
• Record net revenue at €3,019 million; organic growth of 8.9%1 
• Record backlog at €3,119 million; pro forma organic backlog growth year-on-year of 8.9% 
• Operating EBITA margin improved to 9.8% (2021: 9.6%) 
• Net Working Capital and DSO remained strong at 10.7% and 63 days 
• Sound free cash flow generation of €173 million (2021: €234 million) 
• Proposed dividend growing 6% to €0.74 per share (2021: € 0.70) 
We strengthened our portfolio in 2022 by the acquisitions of IBI, DPS, HydroNET and Giftge Consult. Through these 
acquisitions, we not only significantly grow our presence in North America and Europe, but we will also be in the position to 
provide complementary client services and solutions in high growth markets, including life sciences, semiconductors, and 
industrial manufacturing. As we look ahead to 2023, our focus is on fully embedding the acquisitions into our four Global 
Business Areas, and the shaping of our fourth GBA Intelligence.
Direct economic value generated
Gross revenues for the year amount to €4,029 million. Net revenues totaled € 3,019 million and increased 
organically by 8.9%. Growth was driven by all GBAs, with Resilience and Mobility being exceptionally 
strong in North America and the UK. The acquisition impact was 4.5%, mainly related to IBI, as this 
acquisition was formally closed on 27th of September 2022. The currency impact was 4.7%.
Direct economic value distributed
The basic Earnings per Share (EPS) for 2022 amounted to €1.53 (2021: €1.88). Earnings per Share based 
on Net Income from Operations amounted to €2.26 (2021: €1.96). See note 13 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements for further details.
Arcadis’ dividend policy is aimed at dividend stability and a pay-out of 30-40% of Net Income from
Operations, to provide shareholders a respectable dividend yield, to maintain a healthy financial structure,
and to retain sufficient earnings in order to grow both organically and through acquisitions. In line with 
our policy, a dividend of €0.74 per share (2021: €0.70) is proposed, being 33% of Net Income from 
Operations.
Backlog and order intake
As of 31 December 2022, backlog, expressed in expected net revenues, reached a record high level 
of €3.1 billion (2021: €2.2 billion) reflecting a book-to-bill ratio of 1.03. The group secured €3.0 billion 
order intake during the year and added €494 million of backlog from IBI and €460 million from DPS. 
The organic backlog growth was 4.2% and 8.9% pro forma, as the IBI backlog grew by 10% in 2022 
and the DPS backlog by 34%. 1 Excluding the impact of currency movements, acquisitions, divestments, or footprint reductions (such as the Middle East)

€295 million (2021: €246 million1). The operating EBITA margin improved to 9.8% (2021: 9.6%), driven 
by a year-on-year improvement in Places, mostly in the UK and the US.
Non-operating costs were €62million (2021: €9 million) and include transaction costs related to the 
three recently announced acquisitions, a net loss on divestments of operations in Singapore, Malaysia, 
Hong Kong (Design & Engineering business), Switzerland and France (Environmental Restoration 
business) and restructuring costs. 
Personnel costs
Personnel costs were €2,363million, a 18.3% increase compared to the previous year (2021: €1,996 
million1. Our global total workforce was 35,570 up 21.6% versus last year (29,236) mainly driven by 
the acquisitions.
Other operational costs
Other operational costs were €298 million (2021: €240 million1 and increased due to a normalization 
of travel costs post-COVID and acquisition related consultancy services.
Net finance expense
Net finance expenses increased to €24 million (2021: €19 million). The interest expense on loans and 
borrowings of €14 million (2021: €11 million) increased due to higher average gross debt to finance 
the acquisition of IBI Group and DPS Group and higher interest rates.
Results for associates and joint ventures
Income from associates was €1.6 million (2021: €11 million). In 2021 an exceptional income was included 
due to a favorable outcome of a commercial arbitration.
Income taxes
The underlying income tax rate was 31.3% (2021: 25.1%) and was impacted by, amongst other things,  
non-deductible costs and non-deductible losses on divestments. 
Net income from Operations
Net income from operations increased by 15% to €202 million (2021: €175 million) or €2.26 per share 
(2021: €1.96).
Balance sheet performance 
Year-on-year, the balance sheet total increased to €3,852 million (2021: €2,736 million) mainly as result 
of the acquisitions. 
(Net) Working Capital and Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)

Cash and cash equivalents at year-end amounted to €273 million (2021: €351 million).
Equity
The movements in total equity are summarized in the Consolidated statement of changes in equity 
on page 170.
Loans and borrowings
Net debt increased to €1,005 million (2021: €168 million), driven by the additional loans for 
the acquisition of IBI and DPS. The average net debt/ EBITDA ratio increased to 1.6 (2021: 0.8).  
The proforma net debt/ EBITDA ratio at year-end was 2.2 (2021: 0.5), well within our strategic target 
range of 1.5x to 2.5x.
Financial covenants
The leverage covenant for the €500.0 million syndicated Revolving Credit Facility and the remaining 
Schuldschein loans prescribes that the average net debt to EBITDA ratio is not to exceed the maximum 
of 3.5, which is confirmed to the Lenders twice a year. This leverage covenant is aligned to IFRS 16. 
At 31 December 2022 the average net debt to EBITDA ratio calculated in accordance with the credit 
documentation of the Schuldschein loans and the €500.0 million syndicated Revolving Credit facility 
is 1.6. No other financial covenants exist for these credit facilities. 
All outstanding Schuldschein loans and the syndicated Revolving Credit Facility do not longer contain 
an interest coverage ratio. 
Cash flow performance
Free cash flow generation during the quarter was €146 million generating a full year free cashflow of 
€173 million (2021: €234 million). Higher capex, financing cost and normalization of working capital levels 
contributed to the lower free cash for the year. Net debt increased to €1,005 million (2021: €168 million), 
driven by the additional loans for the acquisition of IBI and DPS.

Focus and scale
In 2022, we witnessed a further reduction in both the number of below target margin projects as well as 
their collective impact to performance. The improvements were widely dispersed and evident across all 
business areas. As with previous years, the number of negative surprises in project performance also 
declined in 2022. Efforts to instill the importance of structured reviews, transparency of issues, 
effectively managing scope changes, and engaging senior leadership for assistance when warranted 
have proven highly effective as has a close collaboration with growth teams to ensure effective 
handover at contract award.
Building upon the initial success of the MEPC program, our refreshed program entitled Make Every 
Project Count Plus (MEPC+) continues as one of our Strategic Transformation initiatives. A network of 
Project Delivery and Performance Managers is empowered to identify and embed improvements based 
on the insights of MEPC+ and is supported by Finance, Legal, and Risk Management functions to 
leverage the entire breadth of the company’s expertise. Given the benefits of the program, it will 
continue in 2023, with a focus on supporting further development of Project Management capability 
and additional standardisation and automation of systems, tools and work processes.
Make Every Project Count 
The Make Every Project Count (MEPC) program, which aims to significantly improve project financial 
performance by aligning our people, behaviors, processes, and systems with The Arcadis Way continued in 
2022 as it remains a fundamental lever to drive improvement in our financial performance and deliver our 
Capital Market Day commitments.

One Arcadis Brand
Our brand is how our company is represented in our markets. It’s what sets us apart from the competition. 
It’s the promise that we make to stakeholders, whenever and wherever we interact with them. The Arcadis 
brand manifests itself in how we design solutions, products, and services. It is also how we attract and 
retain talent.
Over 2022 we continued to grow the Arcadis brand. As part of our business transformation, we have 
established a Global Brand and Marketing Campaigns team, which is specifically focused on developing 
content that demonstrates how Arcadis delivers on its brand purpose: improving quality of life. We gauge 
the success of our brand efforts through brand strength and brand awareness measurements, compared 
to our competitors and we also measure the effectiveness of our thought leadership program, which is 
closely connected to business opportunities.
In 2022, the Arcadis brand was valued at 479 million dollars (USD), an increase of 20 million from the year 
before. This means our company has the fifth highest brand value within our competitor set. Our efforts 
to enhance the Arcadis brand can also be seen in the success of our award-winning brand campaign: The 
Arcadis Sustainable Cities Index 2022: Prosperity Beyond Profit. This was honoured as Best International 
Campaign by B2B Marketing Awards.

 “ This innovative method of creating new platforms or 
extending existing ones has the potential to make a 
significant contribution to the reduction of the carbon 
impact and to accelerating the design and build process. ”
Thomas Meirion | Account Director for Network Rail
How we are different
We helped develop a low-carbon, Footprint Modular Platform, 
which is comprised of rubber blocks made from recycled tyres.
Impact
The modular platform can save many tons of carbon emissions, 
while allowing the UK to ramp up its rail capacity.
25 tons
of CO2 saved per 36 meters of platform
A new, low-carbon method 
for building rail platforms
The Footprint Modular Platform, UK
The
Challenge
The
Solution
The
Impact
International targets to keep global warming below 1.5C can only be 
achieved through a shift in how we travel. However, transport authorities 
face a challenge when it comes to encouraging residents to leave their 
car at home and use public modes of transport, like trains and trams. 
To succeed, the rail network will need to be expanded to deal with a 
rise in demand, and this includes more frequent and longer trains. 
To accommodate longer trains, existing infrastructure therefore also 
needs to be upgraded, with the construction of many new platforms 
and the extension of existing ones. But building these platforms can be a 
lengthy and disruptive process, generating a significant amount of carbon 
emissions that are often embodied in building materials such as concrete 
and steel. 
Arcadis experts helped Scott Parnell Ltd develop an innovative 
sustainable alternative to standard platform construction: the Footprint 
Modular Platform. This new type of platform is the result of a 
collaboration between Footprint Civil Solutions (promoter), Rosehill Rail 
(manufacturer), Scott Parnell (distributer), and Arcadis (designer). The low 
carbon platform is comprised of individual blocks, which are made from 
recycled tyre rubber. The blocks are relatively lightweight and therefore 
easy to transport and set in place. Furthermore, because the Footprint 
Modular Platform is made according to Network Rail’s specifications, it 
can be used right across the UK.
The Footprint Modular Platform has a significantly smaller carbon footprint 
than platforms made with traditional materials. A 36-meter platform, made 
using this new approach, saves 25 tons of carbon emissions. Additionally, 
the rubber blocks can reduce installation time. This is because construction 
is less contingent on the weather, unlike laying concrete. Secondly, off-site 
modular manufacturing enhances consistency and quality of the 
components, decreasing the risk of delays. And third, the lightweight 
components are easier to handle and quicker to install, without needing 
heavy lifting equipment. This innovative method of establishing new 
platforms or extending existing ones has the potential to help increase 
UK rail capacity. And this in turn will stimulate more people to use public 
transport instead of single-owner vehicles, contributing to lower carbon 
emissions and a cleaner environment.

Governance & Compliance Operating responsibility
Composition of the Executive Board
Peter Oosterveer was appointed Chief Executive Officer 
and Chairman of the Executive Board of Arcadis NV in 2017. 
He successfully led the company in achieving its 2018-2020 
strategic goals, strengthening its balance sheet, significantly 
reducing the voluntary turnover and closing out several 
legacy issues. Additionally, he led the company to become 
a frontrunner in using data and digital platforms, and an 
industry leader in delivering sustainable solutions to client 
challenges.
At the end of 2020, Peter unveiled Arcadis’ corporate 
strategy for 2021-2023: Maximizing Impact. In it, Arcadis 
has committed to addressing global mega trends like 
Climate Change, Urbanization, and evolving Societal 
Expectations, by making sustainability the common thread, 
by preserving and expanding its digital leadership, and by 
focusing on the global delivery of scalable solutions. This 
strategy is underpinned by Peter’s conviction that by 
embedding sustainability into all that Arcadis does, the 
company can further improve its financial performance, 
while having an outsized, positive impact on the environment 
and helping to create resilient communities. A significant part 
of this impact will be created through Arcadis’ commitment to 
be Net Zero. 
Before joining Arcadis, Peter worked at Fluor Corporation 
which he joined in 1988 as Controls System Engineer. Peter 
led Fluor’s global SAP implementation, worked as General 
Manager for the company in the Netherlands and ultimately 
became part of Fluor’s Corporate Leadership Team, working 
in the United States, initially as President of Energy and 
Chemicals and from 2014 as Chief Operating Officer.
Prior to his career at Fluor, Peter worked for Hoogovens 
IJmuiden (now Tata Steel) and Alpha Engineering. Peter 
Oosterveer is also a former Director of the US-China Business 
Council and a former Director of FMC Technologies.
Peter has a bachelor’s degree in information technique 
from the HTS Leeuwarden. 
1 In October 2022, Peter Oosterveer announced his retirement per the end 
 of the AGM in May 2023
Virginie decided to join Arcadis partly because of 
the inspiration she took from discovering the many 
innovative projects the company does that create a 
tangible, positive impact on the world. In her role as 
Chief Financial Officer, Virginie is tasked with ensuring 
the company’s financial stability and growth, so that 
Arcadians can continue focusing their creativity and 
expertise on improving quality of life. 
Virginie started her career in 1997 as an external 
auditor and spent more than ten years at Arthur 
Andersen and Ernst & Young (now EY), before 
joining the French television broadcaster Canal+ 
as Compliance Officer for Accounting Standards.
Virginie held several finance positions at Technip, and 
then TechnipFMC, where she became Group Deputy 
Chief Financial Officer and a member of the Senior 
Leadership Team. Directly before joining Arcadis, she 
was the Chief Financial Officer of the publicly listed 
company Gemalto and led the defence process of that 
group in 2017, which resulted in the acquisition of Gemalto 
by the Thales Group.

and management from Toulouse Business School.

Corporate Governance report
Corporate Governance report
Arcadis is committed to the principles of good governance: integrity, transparency, accountability, and proper 
supervision. It has complied with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code since it was first introduced in 2003, with 
few deviations. On 20 December 2022, the Dutch Corporate Governance Committee (the ‘Committee’) presented 
a revised Corporate Governance Code with an increased focus on sustainability, diversity and inclusion.  
Listed companies have until 31 December 2023 to implement any changes resulting from the new Code. 
Arcadis will work with internal stakeholders to implement changes required to company policies and 
processes, if any. Arcadis will report on its compliance with the principles and best practices of the new 
Code in our Annual Report 2023. In line with the Committee’s recommendation, Arcadis will include 
compliance with the new Code as a separate item on the agenda of the General Meeting of Shareholders 
(the ‘General Meeting’) in 2024.
The core topics of the Corporate Governance Code are all explicitly addressed in various chapters of this 
Annual Integrated Report. For example, diversity in the Executive Board, Executive Leadership Team and 
Supervisory Board is addressed in this Corporate Governance report on pages 121 to 123. Long-term 
value creation within Arcadis is addressed on pages 18 to 23 in the Executive Board report. Our company 
culture is discussed in the section People and culture starting on page 48. The section on Enterprise Risk 
Management can be found on page 131. An overview of the corporate governance structure of Arcadis in 
2022 is provided below. Arcadis applies all principles and best practice provisions of the Corporate 
Governance Code, with one historical exception. This is described on page 125. For additional information 
about corporate governance at Arcadis, please visit our website.

Organizational structure
The Executive Board is entrusted with the management of Arcadis NV (the ‘Company’), under the 
supervision of the Supervisory Board. The Executive Leadership Team is accountable for the successful 
delivery of all components of the strategy. Since 2003, Arcadis NV has been an international holding 
company. Members of the Executive and Supervisory Boards are appointed and dismissed by the General 
Meeting. The General Meeting can amend the Articles of Association if and as proposed by the Executive 
Board, with prior approval of the Supervisory Board and the Arcadis Priority Foundation. Such a decision 
requires a majority of at least three-quarters of the votes cast in a meeting in which at least three-
quarters of the issued share capital is represented. If the quorum is not met, a second meeting is required, 
in which the resolution can be adopted by a majority of at least three-quarters of the votes, regardless of 
the share capital represented in the meeting. 
Executive Board
The Executive Board consists of the CEO and the CFO. The Executive Board is responsible for the 
management of the Company as well as the continuity of the Company and the Company’s goals, 
objectives, long-term value creation strategy, policy, and results. 
The General Meeting appoints the Executive Board members. For every appointment, the Supervisory 
Board is entitled to make a nomination. The General Meeting can overrule a binding nomination by the 
Supervisory Board by a resolution adopted by a majority of at least two-thirds of the votes, representing 
more than half of the issued share capital. On a non-binding nomination, the General Meeting decides by 
simple majority. The General Meeting can dismiss an Executive Board member. Such a decision, other 
than proposed by the Supervisory Board, requires at least two-thirds of the votes, representing at least 
half of the issued share capital. The Supervisory Board appoints one of the members of the Executive

Board as Chair and determines, in consultation with the Executive Board, the division of tasks. The 
composition of the Executive Board and information about its members is provided on page 116 of 
this Annual Integrated Report. 
Executive Leadership Team
Per year-end 2022, the Executive Leadership Team consists of the CEO, the CFO and five executives 
including the Chief People Officer, the Chief Operating Officer, the Chief Growth Officer, the Chief 
Innovation Officer1 and, since 1 December 2022, the Chief Transformation Officer. The composition of the 
Executive Leadership Team and information about its members is provided on page 117 of this Annual 
Integrated Report. The CEO determines the number of members of the Executive Leadership Team with 
approval of the Supervisory Board. The members of the Executive Leadership Team who are not Executive 
Board members are appointed and dismissed by the CEO, subject to approval of the Supervisory Board. 
At least once a year, the Executive Leadership Team evaluates its own functioning as a whole and that of 
individual members. At least once a year, outside the presence of the Executive Board and the Executive 
Leadership Team, the Supervisory Board evaluates the functioning of the Executive Leadership Team, the 
Executive Board and that of the individual Executive Board members and discusses the conclusions that 
must be attached to the evaluation, also in light of succession planning. 
Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board supervises and advises the Executive Board and the Executive Leadership Team on 
the performance of its tasks and supervises the overall development of the Company and its affiliates. In 
doing so, the Supervisory Board is guided by the interests of the Company and its stakeholders. Pursuant 
to the Articles of Association of the Company, the Supervisory Board consists of at least three members. 
Members are appointed by the General Meeting. For every appointment, the Supervisory Board is entitled 
to make a nomination. The General Meeting can overrule a binding nomination of the Supervisory Board 
by a resolution adopted by a majority of at least two-thirds of the votes, representing more than one-third 
of the issued share capital. In the case of a non-binding nomination, the General Meeting decides by 
simple majority. The General Meeting can dismiss a member of the Supervisory Board. Such a decision, 
other than proposed by the Supervisory Board, requires at least two-thirds of the votes, representing at 
least one-third of the issued share capital. The Supervisory Board appoints one of its members as Chair 
and one as Vice-Chair2. In the case of an appointment or reappointment of Supervisory Board members, 
the Supervisory Board profile is taken into account. Members are appointed for a maximum period of four 
years. Pursuant to best practice provision 2.2.2 of the Corporate Governance Code, a Supervisory Board 
member may be reappointed once for a second maximum period of four years, and subsequently for a 
maximum period of two years, which reappointment may be extended by a maximum of another two 
years. In the event of a reappointment after eight years, reasons will be given in the report of the 
Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board has established the following committees from among its 
members: an Audit and Risk Committee, a Selection Committee and a Remuneration Committee and 
 – since 2020 – a Sustainability Committee. The task of these four committees is to assist and advise the 
Supervisory Board in fulfilling its responsibilities. The tasks and procedures of the committees are 
outlined in their charters, which can be found on our website. The composition of the Supervisory Board 
in 2022, its committees, and information about the Supervisory Board members are provided on pages 
118 and 119 of this Annual Integrated Report.
At least once per year, outside the presence of the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board evaluates 
its own functioning, the functioning of the Supervisory Board committees, and that of the individual 
Supervisory Board members, and discusses the conclusions that are attached to the evaluation. 
Diversity in the Executive Board, Executive Leadership Team and Supervisory Board
Arcadis believes that diversity and inclusion should extend to all areas of its organization3. Arcadis 
believes that the organization gains from a broad range of skills and a variety of backgrounds. Based 
on the nature and complexity of the Arcadis business, the markets in which Arcadis operates, and the 
diversity of the client base of Arcadis, Arcadis identified the diversity aspects of gender, nationality/
geographical provenance, and background (education and/or (work) experience) as being most relevant 
for Arcadis and its business. Based on these diversity aspects, several diversity targets have been 
identified for the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board and the Executive Leadership Team. The 
following paragraphs describe these specific diversity targets and their implementation and results 
against the targets. Going forward, Arcadis will continue to identify and search internal and external 
candidates for positions in the Executive Board, the Executive Leadership Team and the Supervisory 
1 Stephan Ritter (Chief Innovation Officer) announced his departure from Arcadis in January 2023.

Board from a variety of backgrounds, whilst at the same time not compromising quality, expertise, and 
experience. In the event that a global recruitment firm is engaged, Arcadis gives search instructions in 
line with the diversity policies. 
Gender – targets & outcome
The Supervisory Board lead from the top and set the following gender diversity targets: for both the 
Executive Board and the Executive Leadership Team at least 30% shall consist of women, and at least 
30% shall consist of men. Likewise, for the Supervisory Board at least 30% shall consist of women, and 
at least 30% shall consist of men. Per year-end 2022, the Executive Board consisted of one woman (50%) 
and one man (50%). Per year-end 2022, the Executive Leadership Team consisted of four women (57.1%) 
and three men (42.9%). The Supervisory Board consisted of four men (66.7%) and two women (33.3%). 
With this Arcadis achieved its gender diversity targets.
Measures we take to ensure gender diversity
We review all board and leadership composition by giving special attention to female applicants. This 
has helped us reach our diversity goal of 30% women at board level. Maintaining this balance is one of 
the main foundational aspects of our diversity strategy. We have set our global gender target for female 
leadership (Arcadis level 12 and above) at 22%. To support this, we have a commitment that all advertised 
senior management roles (Arcadis level 12 and above) have a diverse shortlist (at least one female and 
one male candidate on the shortlist) and at least one male and one female interviewer. In a male 
dominated industry we focus on developing our female talent from entry level to board level, thus adding 
diversity of thought and understanding of society in our design, client approach and decision-making.
Nationality/geographical provenance – targets & outcome
Arcadis is active in many countries worldwide. We therefore intentionally ensure our leadership reflects 
the experiences (by geography) of our colleagues, clients and partners. Our focus is to build on the 
diversity of thought and experience across all our leadership teams, recognizing that we can also be more 
diverse in the societies we represent. For 2022, Arcadis set the following targets in terms of nationality/
geographical provenance. In the Executive Leadership Team, nationalities from at least three geographical 
regions where Arcadis is active shall be represented. In the Supervisory Board, at least three geographical 
regions where Arcadis is active shall be represented. Based on the composition of the Executive 
Leadership Team and the Supervisory Board in 2022, Arcadis met these diversity targets. 
Background: education and/or (work) experience – targets & outcome
We believe that Arcadis benefits from the comprehensive backgrounds within our Executive Leadership 
Team and Supervisory Board. Our experience of balancing a focus on our people and culture with 
developing client relationships and deep technical knowledge allows us to have a balanced and 
considered approach across the spectrum of our work. The background target for the Executive 
Leadership Team requires that at least three members shall have experience in the global design, the 
engineering and/or the consulting industry or an industry adjacent thereto. Arcadis met this target in 
2022 as seven members of the Executive Leadership Team have this type of experience. The background 
target for the Supervisory Board consists of two requirements. The first requirement, which also follows 
from the Dutch Decree Establishing Audit Committees, is that at least one member of the Supervisory 
Board shall have a financial background. As three of the six Supervisory Board members have a financial 
background, Arcadis met this requirement in 2022. The second target set by Arcadis requires that at least 
one member of the Supervisory Board shall have experience in the global design, the engineering and/or 
the consulting industry or an industry adjacent thereto. This target was also met in 2022 with six 
members having this type of experience.

General Meeting of Shareholders
At least once a year, Arcadis NV convenes a shareholder meeting. Meetings are convened by the 
Executive and/ or Supervisory Board. Meetings can also be convened at the request of shareholders 
jointly representing at least 10% of the Company’s issued share capital if authorized by the relevant 
Dutch court. Shareholders who hold at least 3% of the issued share capital have the right to propose 
an item for inclusion on the agenda. The Company will in principle include the item on the agenda if it 
receives the substantiated proposal clearly stating the item to be discussed, or a draft resolution, in 
writing at least 60 days prior to the meeting date. Each shareholder is entitled to attend shareholder 
meetings in person or be represented by written proxy and to exercise voting rights with due observance 
of the provisions in the Articles of Association. Each outstanding share entitles the holder to one vote. 
Resolutions are adopted by simple majority unless the Articles of Association or the law provide(s) 
otherwise. Arcadis advocates active shareholder participation at shareholder meetings. 
Since 2007, the Articles of Association allow for communication and voting by electronic means. For more 
information about the powers of the General Meeting as well as the Company’s Articles of Association, 
please visit:
www.arcadis.com/en/about-us/governance
Share capital
The authorized share capital of Arcadis NV consists of ordinary shares, cumulative financing preference 
shares, priority shares, and cumulative preference (protective) shares, each with a nominal value of €0.02. 
At year-end 2022, the total number of ordinary shares issued was 90,442,091 Currently, only ordinary 
shares and 600 priority shares have been issued. See note 26 to the Consolidated financial statements 
for further details. Priority shares and cumulative preference shares have an impact on the governance 
of the Company.
Priority shares
The 600 priority shares, held by the Arcadis Priority Foundation (Stichting Prioriteit Arcadis NV), 
entitle the holder to a right of approval regarding certain important decisions. These include the issuance, 
acquisition or disposal of shares, amendments to the Articles of Association, dissolution of the Company, 
as well as certain major co-operations, acquisitions, and divestments. Pursuant to the articles of 
association of the Priority Foundation, the Priority Foundation Board is comprised of two members of 
the Executive Board, one member of the Executive Leadership Team, seven members of the Supervisory 
Board, and ten members who are Arcadis employees. All resolutions of the Board require a majority of at 
least 60% of the votes cast, meaning that both employee support and Board support is needed for those 
far-reaching decisions. 
Cumulative preference (protective) shares
Currently, no cumulative preference shares have been issued. However, an option agreement to acquire 
and transfer such shares has been entered into between the Arcadis Preferred Stock Foundation 
(Stichting Preferente Aandelen Arcadis NV) and Arcadis NV, further to the delegation on 31 May 1995 
by the General Meeting to the Supervisory Board of the authority to issue shares. The objective of the 
Arcadis Preferred Stock Foundation is to protect the interests of Arcadis, its enterprises, and all of those 
involved. In the event of any hostile situation, preference shares can be obtained by this Foundation. This 
would allow the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board time to duly consider the situation and the 
interests involved. For more information, please see note 26 to the Consolidated financial statements. 
Regulations regarding transactions in Arcadis securities
Arcadis has put in place regulations regarding transactions in Arcadis securities that apply to all 
employees unless stipulated otherwise. These regulations also prohibit Executive Board members and 
(other) members of the Executive Leadership Team from executing transactions in the securities of 
certain identified listed peer companies, regardless of whether they have inside information or not. 
Members of the Supervisory Board are required to obtain prior approval from the Global Compliance 
Officer if they wish to execute transactions in the securities of such companies.

Financial reporting and role of auditors
Before being presented to the General Meeting for adoption, annual financial statements as prepared 
by the Executive Board must be examined by an external certified public auditor. The General Meeting 
has the authority to appoint the auditor. Each year, the Supervisory Board nominates the auditor for 
(re) appointment by the General Meeting, taking into account the advice of the Audit and Risk Committee. 
The auditor’s assignment and remuneration are resolved on by the Supervisory Board, on the 
recommendation of the Audit and Risk Committee. Prior to publication, the half-year results and 
reports are discussed with the Audit and Risk Committee in the presence of the external auditors, and 
subsequently with the Supervisory Board. The (quarterly) results and reports of the first and the third 
quarter are discussed with the Audit and Risk Committee, in the presence of the external auditors, prior 
to publication.
The external auditor attends all Audit and Risk Committee meetings and the meetings of the Supervisory 
Board in which the annual financial statements are to be approved and the year-end audit report of the 
external auditor is discussed. The Arcadis Auditor Independence Policy contains rules and procedures 
for the engagement of the external auditor, in order to ensure its independence. The Audit and Risk 
Committee annually reports to the Supervisory Board on the functioning of the external auditor and 
the relationship with the external auditor, whilst giving due consideration to the Executive Board's 
observations. The desirability of rotating the external auditor’s lead partner is also evaluated. In 2014, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants NV was appointed as the new auditor for financial year 2015. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers has been reappointed by the General Meeting every year since then. In line with 
the EU Audit regulation1, as of financial year 2025 rotation of the external auditor is required and the 
appointment of a new external auditor will be on the agenda of the 2024 annual General Meeting. Arcadis 
has an internal audit function which operates under the responsibility of the Executive Board (with lines 
to the CEO, CFO, and the Audit and Risk Committee). 
The role of the internal audit function is to assess the design and the operation of the internal risk 
management and control systems. The scope of work of the internal audit function is regulated in an 
Internal Audit Charter. In line with the Corporate Governance Code, both the appointment and dismissal 
of the Head of Internal Audit shall be submitted to the full Supervisory Board for approval, with a 
recommendation issued by the Audit and Risk Committee. In line with the Corporate Governance Code, 
the Executive Board, the external auditor and the annual Internal Audit Plan and Risk Committee are 
involved in the preparation and approval of the annual Internal Audit Plan. The annual internal audit 
plan is submitted to the Executive Board and Supervisory Board for approval. Internal Audit Reports are 
discussed with the Executive Board and with the Audit and Risk Committee in the presence of the 
external auditor.
Compliance with the principles and best practice provisions  
of the Corporate Governance Code
Arcadis applies the principles and best practices of the Corporate Governance Code, except for the 
following and for the reasons set out below: 
4.3.3: In 2003, the Articles of Association of the Company were amended to abandon the structure 
regime. At that time, provisions were included in the Articles of Association that prescribe that binding 
nominations for the appointment or dismissal of members of the Executive and Supervisory Board can 
only be overruled by the General Meeting by a qualified majority rather than an absolute majority. This 
was done in view of the percentage of share ownership of the Lovinklaan Foundation. As the percentage 
of share ownership of Lovinklaan is still significant (18.2% on 31 December 2022, see page 236), the 
reasons for this deviation are still applicable and the deviation is expected to continue to apply as long as 
Lovinklaan has a significant ownership. It was further stipulated that nominations to the Executive Board 
would normally be binding, whereas nominations to the Supervisory Board would, under normal 
circumstances, be non-binding. The General Meeting explicitly approved this practice in 2003 by adopting 
the resolution to make the related amendments to the Articles of Association.

 “ The regeneration has transformed residents’ lives with 
good quality, spacious homes. Improved energy efficiency 
makes homes easier to heat, cheaper to run, and more 
comfortable to live in. ”
Kerry Fleming | Director 
How we are different
An integrated approach to Passivhaus development, providing net-
zero-ready homes with a fabric-first design that provides more 
insulation and better air tightness. 
Impact
Resident’s lives have been transformed with quality, spacious 
homes. Improved energy efficiency makes homes easier to heat, 
cheaper to run, and more comfortable to live in. 
70%
reduction in energy consumption for residents
Creating the largest eco-development 
of its kind in the UK
Agar Grove Passivhaus Regeneration, London
The
Challenge
The
Solution
The
Impact
The Agar Grove housing estate was built in the 1960s but, in recent years, 
the homes were no-longer fit for purpose. Small, damp and outdated, a 
change needed to be made. With fuel poverty one of the biggest issues 
facing many people today, Camden Council – the local authority landlord 
and developer responsible for the homes - needed to improve energy 
efficiency, making the homes easier to heat, cheaper to run, and more 
comfortable for residents to live in. Passivhaus was the perfect solution. 
Passivhaus is a proven approach for delivering net-zero-ready homes, 
focusing on fabric-first design to provide greater insulation and air tightness. 
It meant that Camden London Borough Council could provide high-quality, 
fit for purpose homes, while cutting carbon, minimizing maintenance costs 
and reducing fuel bills for residents. 
Our role was to manage design and delivery, working with Passivhaus 
consultancy, WARM. Passivhaus designs are demanding to achieve, and the 
building had to be carefully optimised to reduce heat loss. This is a delicate 
process but, through close monitoring, early risk identification and 
collaboration, we achieved the project aims and objectives. Our team of 
project management experts provided an integrated, holistic service to help 
Camden Council make more informed decisions throughout the scheme. 
With two phases now complete and awarded Passivhaus certification, the 
regeneration of Agar Grove has transformed residents’ homes in Camden. 
The next phase is now under construction, and the success of the 
development means that families are guaranteed quality, comfortable, 
spacious homes. Residents are seeing up to 70% reduction in their energy 
bills, as the home is now able to hold its warmth in winter – rarely dropping 
below 21°C - but remain cool in summer. And with little maintenance 
required, the building will stand the test of time. Agar Grove has received 
12 awards for its forward-thinking approach to sustainability. It has also 
been praised by the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, who sees the work at 
Agar Grove - building affordable homes in a green, sustainable way - as a 
key part of the fight against climate change and integral to making 
London net zero by 2030.

Corporate Governance report
Business ethics
Today’s complex business environment demands that we firmly embed integrity in our values,  
our culture and our daily business practices. Integrity means that we always work to the highest  
professional and ethical standards and establish trust by being transparent, honest and responsible. 
Integrity is a fulfilment of our high standards of responsibility to our clients, shareholders, business 
partners and our people, the public, and to governments and the laws and culture of the countries in 
which we operate. The Arcadis General Business Principles (AGBP), refreshed in 2022, further define our 
interpretation of business ethics and form our Code of Conduct. The AGBP have been developed by global 
leadership at Arcadis and set guidance for our business decisions and actions throughout the world at all 
levels and apply equally to company actions and to individual behavior of all our employees in conducting 
Arcadis’ business. Arcadis recognizes that true integrity in our daily business will be underpinned by the 
commitment to the principles of the AGBP of our employees and the third parties we do business with. 
Governance
Arcadis acknowledges that the ultimate responsibility for the implementation and application of the 
AGBP lies with the Arcadis Executive Board and the primary responsibility with the operating entities 
(first line of defense). The Corporate Compliance Committee is composed of the Global General Counsel, 
the Chief People Officer (member of the Executive Leadership Team) as well as the Global Compliance 
Officer. The Global Compliance Officer reports on AGBP integrity, compliance and related (alleged) issues 
to the Corporate Compliance Committee, to the CEO of Arcadis and the Arcadis Audit and Risk Committee 
of the Supervisory Board (AARC) or directly to the Supervisory Board. Both at GBA and at country level 
the Compliance function is composed of a Compliance Officer and a Compliance Committee. Each 
Compliance Committee includes the Compliance Officer as well as Legal and Human Resource/ People 
expertise. The Compliance function is the second line of defense that assists and supports the first line of 
defense with identification and analysis of key Regulatory & Policy Compliance risks, trend spotting, 
mitigation of compliance risks through the introduction of policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines, 
providing training and awareness and with periodic assessment of the effectiveness of the risk mitigating 
controls. The Internal Audit function provides the third line of defense and the priorities for Internal Audit 
are defined in an annual audit plan which could include AGBP integrity or compliance related risks.
Anti-Bribery and Corruption
Specific Anti-Corruption Standards (SACS) provide specific guidelines related to gifts, hospitality and 
payments to third parties. Arcadis has embedded its commitment to the UN Global Compact principle on 
anti-corruption by referencing the SACS in the AGBP as well as having a dedicated chapter on anti-bribery 
and corruption in the refreshed AGBP. Targeted anti-corruption training sessions by leadership and by 
Compliance Officers were held in various regions and countries throughout the year, tailored to local laws 
and regulations.
Dealing with dilemmas
The AGBP cannot anticipate the array of dilemmas we may face in our day-to-day operations in each 
jurisdiction and sector in which we operate. An active policy in this area means recognizing dilemmas 
and taking responsibility for resolving them. Arcadis encourages its employees to recognize and discuss 
business dilemmas with each other and with their management, to make integrity an integral part of 
our culture. Real life AGBP related scenarios are worked into anonymized dilemmas which are fed back 
into the business via training to raise awareness and ensure lessons learned are impactful and effective. 
The refreshed AGBP has introduced an AGBP Decision Making Tool that assists employees in handling 
dilemmas by setting out the key questions to help determine whether a particular course of action is 
consistent with the core values and the AGBP.
Value for customers
We are a reliable partner for our clients and aim to deliver our services without jeopardizing stakeholder 
interests. We offer services under terms that do not compromise our independent professional judgment 
and aim to create value for clients. We are transparent with clients about conflicts of interest that could 
emerge during the execution of our services.

Responsible employment practices
Arcadis employees are key to its success, and we respect human and labor rights so that our employees 
may work in a safe, healthy, professional and supportive environment. We encourage engagement and 
support personal development through comprehensive policies and initiatives. Every Arcadis employee 
has an equal opportunity for personal recognition, advancement, career development and compensation, 
regardless of background or beliefs. No form of discrimination is tolerated. The human and labor rights 
policy applies equally to recruitment, our supply chains and procurement. The policy is supported by a 
three-year Human Rights Roadmap to drive implementation. This policy lays out Arcadis ambitions 
aligned with global expectations for our own operations, our supply chains, including procurement, 
and for the project work we do for clients. 
Monitoring and accountability
Arcadis requires all employees to understand, sign off on and comply with the AGBP every other year 
when Arcadis employees complete online training aimed at increasing awareness of our AGBP and values. 
This training specifically addresses issues like corruption, bribery, conflicts of interest, anti-competitive 
practices, and other risks to which our people may be exposed. It was rolled out in October 2022 and 
made available in 10 languages. Employees that join Arcadis must successfully pass the AGBP training 
within 30 days of joining. In 2022, a total of 94% of all employees passed the AGBP training1. The next 
round of integrity training for all our employees will be organized in 2023 and will follow an annual 
training cycle. Arcadis monitors compliance with the AGBP in all operating companies on a quarterly 
basis through reporting on AGBP (alleged) issues and mid-year reporting on progress against the 
annually established Global Integrity & Anti-Corruption Program. In addition, management of all 
operating companies certify compliance and the effectiveness of global controls relating to the Arcadis 
Risk Category of Regulatory & Policy Compliance through an annual Document of Representation.
Integrity Lines
Arcadis has a reporting procedure which includes an anonymous global Integrity Line managed by a third 
party for the event people are uncomfortable reporting through their line manager or further in the line, 
to their Compliance Officer or the relevant Compliance Committee. The Integrity Line is available to our 
employees 24 hours/ 7 days a week. Reports of potential or suspected misconduct or other AGBP issues 
can be made in native languages. In 2022, a total number of 64 alleged breaches of the AGBP were 
reported through the various reporting channels, including to the Arcadis Corporate Compliance 
Committee (2021: 91). All alleged breaches were assessed and, where necessary, further investigated 
or advised upon, except for 22 alleged breaches that are still being assessed or, where necessary, 
investigated. In addition, there were seven reports of alleged breaches from before 2022 which were still 
being assessed or, where necessary, investigated during the year. Inappropriate behavior (employment-
related) was the category with the most reported issues. There were no confirmed corruption or bribery 
incidents in 2022 based on our assessment and/or investigation. Violation of the AGBP may lead to 
sanctions, up to and including termination of employment. Company-wide Arcadis had nine dismissals on 
grounds related to breaches of the AGBP. Arcadis will not hold employees accountable for any loss of 
business resulting from compliance with the AGBP and its reporting requirements.
Arcadis has a reporting procedure available for its external stakeholders (suppliers, clients and other third 
parties) to report any concerns they may have that the AGBP and/or related policies are being breached. 
This procedure includes an anonymous global Integrity Line managed by a third party. This anonymous 
external Integrity Line is available 24 hours/ 7 days for the event our stakeholders are uncomfortable 
raising a concern or reporting suspected misconduct or irregularities related to the cooperation with 
Arcadis directly with their contact person within Arcadis. The availability of Arcadis’ External Integrity Line 
also ensures our compliance with new regulatory requirements (incl. the EU Whistleblower Directive) and 
UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights. Reporting can be made in native languages and 
can be accessed through local telephone numbers or the internet. In 2022, a total number of four alleged 
breaches of the AGBP were reported through the external integrity line. All alleged breaches were 
assessed and, where necessary, further investigated or advised upon, except for two alleged breaches that 
are still being assessed or, where necessary, investigated.
1 Employees who onboarded during the month of December or are on long term leave of absence on 31 December, possibly have not yet passed the AGBP training and test 
by 31 December. As a consequence, it is likely that Arcadis will not be able to reach a 100% success rate on 31 December of the relevant reporting year

The Global Personal Data Transfer program, introduced in 2021 with ELT sponsorship, was further rolled 
out in 2022. The program included a refresh of the online Privacy Impact Assessment Tool and the 
development of a Transfer Risk Assessment approach in response to the ruling of the European Court of 
Justice (July 2020) on the validity of mechanisms for personal data transfers outside Europe (‘Schrems II’). 
Privacy and personal data protection
This reinforced the importance of effective embedding of Arcadis’ Privacy Standards (also called Binding 
Corporate Rules) and enhanced controls through privacy-by-design in our core business processes and 
project delivery to our clients. The Global Privacy Program rolled out a global awareness campaign which 
included interactive sessions with, among others, the Senior Leadership Group on the importance of 
embedding privacy in all projects and solutions based on the Privacy behavioral framework: ‘identify, 
assess, action & monitor’ and the six privacy rules. The Privacy function, with the Privacy Officer Network, 
has collaborated closely with the Tech and Information Security function in assisting and supporting the 
business (first line of defense) with identification and analysis of key privacy and personal data security 
risks. Such risks have been mitigated through the introduction of standards, procedures, and guidelines, 
providing training and awareness, and assessing the effectiveness of the risk mitigating controls.

Enterprise Risk Management
Exposure to risk is unavoidable in pursuit of Arcadis’ strategy with the level of general risk increasing in 
recent times due to the pandemic and geopolitical events. Emerging risks also present opportunities, 
which if well-managed, result in value creation. However, uncontrolled risks can threaten the achievement 
of long-term strategic objectives.
The Arcadis Risk and Control Framework 
The Arcadis Risk and Control framework (“ARC”) enables a culture of risk awareness across the 
organization by providing a standardized framework for identifying risks and implementing controls. 
The ARC framework identifies key risks, across three risk categories - Strategic, Operational and 
Compliance. It includes business controls which are supported by policies, standards, procedures, 
and guidelines, all of which target risk mitigation in accordance with Arcadis’ risk appetite.
The ARC allows the company to evolve its business in line with its risk appetite, execute strategic priorities 
in a controlled manner and experience less surprises in business performance. The ARC is a cornerstone 
of Arcadis’ risk management approach and supports Arcadis in embedding a risk conscious way of 
working in all layers of the organization.
Management of Risk
Arcadis’ Executive Board is responsible for maintaining a comprehensive risk management and internal 
control system, and for regularly reviewing its effectiveness. Each year, the Executive Board performs 
a review of the risks that Arcadis is subject to and based on its risk assessment, the ARC is updated and 
communicated to leadership. The Executive Board is also responsible for ensuring that the risk 
management and internal control system is integrated and embedded into the way Arcadis works. 
The Executive Board is supported in this by the ELT members. In order to strengthen risk oversight, 
each ELT member is given overall responsibility for one or more of the ARC key risks.

Enterprise Risk Management
The Risk Management function, led by the Global Risk Management Director and supported by a 
Corporate Risk Management team and GBA Risk Managers, provides guidance and assistance to the 
Executive Board and ELT. This includes driving risk awareness across the organization and supporting the 
assessments of the design and operating effectiveness of the ARC Framework across the global business 
(see below ‘Arcadis’ Risk Assurance Program). The Global Risk Management Director reports directly to 
the CFO with a dotted line to the COO.
The Risk Management function provides both risk assurance and proactive risk support to the business. 
Risk Management plays an active role in Pursuit Committees, which seek to ensure that the selection of 
the clients and opportunities are in line with the strategy. Additionally, Risk Management engages with 
leadership teams of GBAs and enabling functions to identify, evaluate and mitigate enterprise risks that 
may impact the achievement of strategic objectives.
The quarterly Risk Management Committee, chaired by the CFO, assesses risk in the context of Arcadis' 
risk appetite and provides advice to the Executive Board/ELT. It assesses whether Arcadis has identified 
and mitigated, or managed, known and emerging risks to ensure that robust risk management is in place 
across Arcadis. The Chair nominates the other members of the Risk Management Committee, to include 
(at least) five members: at least one Senior Business Representative, the Global General Counsel, the 
Global Internal Audit Director, the Global Operations Project Services Officer, and the Global Risk 
Management Director. Their appointment is confirmed by the Executive Board/ELT.
Risk Appetite and Key Risk Indicators
The ARC balances risk and opportunity and helps define the Executive Board’s appetite for risk. Arcadis’ 
risk appetite changes over time reflecting strategic objectives and developments in society, legislation, 
geopolitics, the client landscape, and changes within Arcadis.
Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) are in place for each of the key risks. KRIs are measured and reported to the ELT 
and Audit and Risk Committee on a quarterly basis to provide an early warning as to where exposure to 
certain risks may be exceeding Arcadis’ appetite. Where risk exposure is outside of the appetite range, 
existing mitigating actions may have more focus placed on them, additional controls may be introduced, 
or Arcadis may choose to tolerate that the current level of risk is outside its appetite, in which case 
leadership is informed and monitors the situation closely.  
Risk management in action
Arcadis adopts a three-lines of defense model to facilitate strong governance and risk management. The 
GBAs and certain enabling functions are the first line, embedding risk management as a formal part of all 
major decision making via tools such as risk registers, project watch lists, and client and opportunity Go/
No-Go assessments. The Risk Management function is part of the second line of defense along with other 
enabling functions. These functions assist and support the first line with identification and assessment of 
key risks. Identified risks are mitigated through the introduction of policies, standards, procedures, and 
guidelines, and by providing training and promoting awareness. Arcadis’ Internal Audit function provides 
the third line of defense. Its role is explained in more detail on the next page.
Arcadis encounters risks during the implementation of its strategy, as well as through business 
integrations. Critical to managing these risks is a governance and risk management process which 
allows Arcadis to balance the benefits from strategic programs and integrations, investments required, 
and risks managed.

Arcadis’ Risk Assurance Program
The Risk Assurance Program provides for a continuous annual cycle for testing the design and operational 
effectiveness of the controls to provide assurance that the key risks are being effectively mitigated or 
managed. Each GBA, country and enabling function reports the results of its annual assessment at the 
end of the financial year to the Global Risk Management Director and Group Controller. 
Action plans for controls found not to be designed or operating effectively are formed with deadlines 
established for remediation to be complete. 
The Risk Assurance Program helps identify new and evolving risk causes that require the design of 
controls to be updated and/or strengthened. Where needed, remediation of the controls is identified and 
captured in an action tracker, which is periodically monitored by Risk Management to ensure that the 
remedial actions are on track, with regular status reports provided to the ELT.

Appropriate GBA, country, and enabling function leadership are required to sign an annual Document 
of Representation (DOR), which is addressed to the Group CEO and CFO. In addition, each ELT member 
is required to sign an enabling function DOR that addresses the key risks in their areas of responsibility. 
The DORs include a statement regarding the design and operating effectiveness of controls based on 
the results of the Risk Assurance Program. Based on the combined DORs, Arcadis NV issues a Letter of 
Representation (including an In-Control Statement) to the external auditor.
Internal Audit
Arcadis’ Internal Audit function operates under the responsibility of the Executive Board. Its role is to 
enhance Arcadis’ performance through assurance. The Global Internal Audit Director has direct access 
to the Executive Board, Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee and is a permanent invitee to the 
Audit and Risk Committee meetings. The priorities for Internal Audit are defined with the ELT and the 
Audit and Risk Committee and are approved by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. 
In 2022, Internal Audit updated its annual plan on a quarterly basis to respond to changes in the global 
risk and internal control environment. Changes have been approved by the Executive Board and Audit and 
Risk Committee on behalf of the Supervisory Board. Internal Audit continually interacts with the external 
auditor regarding the preparation and execution of the annual audit plan, changes to the audit plan and 
the main reported results. 
Internal Audit governs itself by complying with the Standards of the Institute of Internal Auditors. 
It employs a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the organization’s governance 
and risk management process. Observations and recommendations, as reported by Internal Audit, are 
submitted to management of the GBAs or enabling functions. Management is responsible for 
executing and monitoring the progress of remedial measures put in place to mitigate and manage 
the reported risks.
The Executive Board and Audit and Risk Committee receive, on a quarterly basis, the results of internal 
audits and an update on the progress of remedial actions. The role of the Audit and Risk Committee 
includes monitoring the progress of management follow up on audit findings.
During 2022, Internal Audit observed certain deficiencies and areas for improvement. However, 
collectively these do not materially impact the overall effectiveness of the risk and control systems, 
taking into consideration the remediation efforts by the business areas and enabling functions.

Risk Appetite:    Averse   Low   Medium   High 
The following table provides an overview of the key risks facing Arcadis, its risk appetite for each risk, and how the organization manages the risk. 
Strategic risks
Market
Risk Description 
Market developments have an adverse effect on Arcadis’ growth. 
Arcadis continues to operate in a competitive market that is exposed to uncertain economic 
cycles, geopolitical shifts, societal, technological, and environmental change and disruption 
by both competitors and client supply chains.   
Capability & Innovation
Risk Description  
Inability to ensure that Arcadians’ knowledge and technical capability match prevailing 
market needs and that Arcadis does not effectively develop and apply innovative solutions 
for the market with a focus on financial return. 
Market needs continue to evolve at pace and maintaining a comprehensive understanding 
of what is needed to achieve a sustainable future using digital capabilities remains 
imperative. Arcadis must move at the same pace as the market and influence buying 
patterns to drive innovation.  
How Arcadis Manages the Risk
1. Performance of strategic research into megatrends, competitors, the global economy, and external markets via 
an established intelligence network. 
2. Regular internal portfolio assessment reviews and continuous scenario planning which helps navigate the impact 
of specific market events. 
3. The Growth function supports the GBAs by promoting commercial excellence, a uniform growth culture linked to 
the brand, and enablement of strategy development through both organic and inorganic means. 
4. Focusing on client relationships to broaden the value provided, therefore creating a stronger market connection.
How Arcadis Manages the Risk
1. With the support of the Lovinklaan Foundation, Expedition DNA, Arcadis’ award-winning online strategic transformation 
program, enables Arcadis employees to effectively act on digital client opportunities. 
2. An Innovation Framework continues to allow Arcadis to maximize the potential of innovative ideas globally.  
Innoverse, a global innovation platform, facilitates idea generation, validation and development with the support 
of experts.  
3. Combining the experience of Arcadis and the agility of its ecosystem partners increases the pace of innovation and access 
to technology resources. 
4. The creation of the GBA Intelligence, enhances Arcadis’ position as a digital leader, and its ability to serve its clients in a 
more efficient way across all phases of the asset lifecycle.

Enterprise Risk Management
Acquisition & Divestment
Risk Description 
Acquisitions do not deliver the intended return on investment or that assets to be divested 
are not divested in a timely fashion for the right values. 
In 2022, Arcadis completed acquisitions to accelerate its ‘Maximizing Impact’ strategy and 
divested certain operations as part of its ‘Focus and Scale’ strategic axis. 
Corporate Finance
Risk Description 
Inadequate access to capital from external sources at commercially acceptable terms 
resulting in an inability to invest in organic growth and/or business acquisitions.
Arcadis has increased its short-term debt to fund its acquisitions in 2022. In combination 
with rising interest rates, Arcadis has increased its focus on this risk.
How Arcadis Manages the Risk
1. All acquisition and divestment activities are managed by a central team of experts. 
2. Arcadis continues to review its portfolio in certain markets and sectors to continue alignment of its risk profile with its strategy. 
3. A formal acquisition process is followed for reviewing targets, their strategic and cultural fit, and for assessing the potential 
increase of stakeholder value, considering both financial and non-financial impacts. Due diligence is performed by the central 
team consisting of experienced internal experts, with support from external advisors, when needed. The ELT has continuous 
input, providing governance and approvals throughout the whole sourcing and acquisition process. 
4. For divestments, a formal process is followed to find the most suitable acquirer of the businesses. Specific regard is given 
to ensuring a good future for the business to be divested and its people, disentanglement and avoiding ongoing Arcadis 
commitments. 
5. An Integration Lead is identified at the start of the due diligence process to allow for an integration roadmap to be 
developed, including the identification of opportunities and cost synergies to be tracked during the integration process.
Additional detail on how business integrations are managed is provided in the Transformation Programs risk section on page 138.  
How Arcadis Manages the Risk
1. The Group Treasury function provides expertise for all corporate financing activities and approves all facilities.
2. The global treasury policy is implemented across the organization, including defining the risk appetite, guiding principles, 
corporate finance and liquidity management policy, interest rate management policy, and foreign exchange management 
policy.
3. A 3-year financial scenario analysis is performed to provide continuous insight into the impact of material changes, such as 
business underperformance, the financial impact of acquisitions and divestments, and/or an increase in net working capital.
4. Arcadis retains a focus on diversification of sources of capital to avoid becoming overly reliant on certain investor types or 
capital providers as it replaces acquisition debt with long-term debt. Arcadis’ access to debt capital markets is facilitated by 
its external credit rating from Standard and Poor’s.

Client & Opportunity
Risk Description 
An insufficient number of strategic pursuits are converted to profitable wins, resulting in 
growth in revenue falling short of business objectives. 
In 2022, inherent uncertainties have existed across the markets, economies, and sectors 
in which Arcadis operates. As it moves into 2023, Arcadis expects these uncertainties to 
remain, with the threat of recession increasing in some countries and certain sectors likely 
to be impacted. These uncertainties are accompanied by opportunities to which Arcadis 
must react with agility.
Project & Contract Execution
Risk Description 
Underperformance in the delivery of projects results in suboptimal project financial results, 
dissatisfied clients, and claims. 
Arcadis manages a variety of risks in project delivery including service delivery quality, 
schedule compliance, commercial and contract terms, and the impact of external factors on 
project performance. 
Arcadis’ risk profile is affected by the provision of new services, the size and complexity of 
projects, the requirement to adopt alternate service delivery models, the engagement of 
new clients and attempts by clients to shift risk to service providers.  
How Arcadis Manages the Risk
1. A global business operating model increases the visibility of opportunities. Leadership focuses on achieving a robust 
pipeline of opportunities and a healthy book-to-bill ratio, which are imperative for continued success. Arcadis achieves 
diversification across geographies, sectors, and solutions while maintaining an appropriate mix of private and public sector 
clients. Regular monitoring of its client and project mix allows Arcadis to react with agility and impact.
2. The ELT sponsors formal key and emerging client programs. These programs support GBA and sector leadership to 
prioritize sales efforts. Arcadis is committed to working with key and emerging clients, with exceptions only being 
considered should an opportunity not align with our strategy or have unmitigable risks.
3. Pursuit committees involving senior stakeholders provide pursuit governance and risk mitigation.
4. Monitoring of government spending programs and private investment in the markets in which it operates allows Arcadis 
to pursue new and/or accelerated projects. Energy transition and sustainability remain key drivers of spends across both 
public and private sectors.
5. Performance of an annual client experience survey allows Arcadis to track its performance. Better practices are shared 
across client account teams and GBA leadership, and plans have been established to address areas for improvement.
How Arcadis Manages the Risk
1. A Global Operations Project Services organization has been established to institutionalize the application of a consistent, 
structured project delivery model across the global business. This organization facilitates improved outcomes in terms of 
quality, health & safety, and project performance. The organization also oversees the implementation of increased levels of 
standardization and automation within project services. 
2. The MEPC+ program continues to improve project outcomes by improving project performance monitoring, 
risk management, handover, governance and change control, and cash collection.    
3. The adoption of a global business operating model provides Arcadis an improved ability to effectively deploy the best skills 
and experience to its projects, regardless of geography, and thereby improve client service, project risk management and 
project performance. 
4. The ongoing implementation of a global Integrated Management System sees quality move from being regionally 
managed to a unified system with a center of excellence at its core.

Enterprise Risk Management
People & Capacity
Risk Description 
Insufficient talent to win and deliver client projects and lead the business to achieve its 
fullest potential.
Strong competition exists for strong technical and leadership talent in the sectors in which 
Arcadis operates, requiring a focus on retention and attrition. The importance of the 
workplace has increased as employees return to the office and work from home in a hybrid 
manner, and Arcadis remains flexible to employees’ individual needs.
Transformation Programs
Risk Description 
Major change programs are not delivered effectively or cost efficiently, impeding the 
achievement of strategic objectives, including growth, collaboration, and operational 
efficiency.
A global transformation program is being undertaken to deliver the objectives of the 
current strategic cycle while simultaneously integrating acquired companies into our global 
operating structure. Arcadis recognizes that in pursuing the benefits of transformation and 
integration programs, potential negative impacts require managing due to the disruption 
they can cause if not handled well.
How Arcadis Manages the Risk
1. Attrition rates are closely monitored across the business, with actions taken as and when required to address areas where 
attrition is higher than expected. The employee listening platform, “Your Voice” , is operated globally to help measure 
employee engagement and allow leadership to act on feedback
2. The Aligned Leadership Program activates the leadership framework by allowing the identification and development of 
senior leadership talent to embed and lead the strategy and transformation throughout the organization.
3. The performance management framework, “Grow Perform Succeed” , continues to provide frequent and meaningful 
performance conversations focused on the future, employee growth, and career development.
4. Leadership is committed to delivering Arcadis’ workstyle promise, embracing flexible working arrangements, empowering 
all employees to succeed, and creating sustainable, inclusive workplaces which enhance employee experience.
5. The implementation of a well-being and resilience strategy enables all Arcadians to focus on their health and well-being 
while working.
How Arcadis Manages the Risk
1. Global Transformation and Integration Leaders oversee strategy implementation and business integrations, monitor the 
achievement of benefits and report directly to the ELT. 
2. Both a Transformation Engine and Integration Management office have been established with a clear focus on schedule 
risk, interdependencies, effective change management, and communication, driving towards the committed business 
outcomes.
3. A portfolio risk management process has been adopted, which enables prioritizing the key risks to achieving successful 
transformation and integration while maintaining the current business performance.
4. A Change Management center of excellence provides capability across GBAs and enabling functions. 
5. Regarding integrations, Arcadis monitors value creation from past acquisitions with a formal review of acquisitions after 
one and three years to help optimize the process and learn lessons to benefit future integrations.

Third Party Management
Risk Description 
Inadequate selection of and/or performance by third parties (e.g., suppliers, sub-
contractors, joint venture partners and ecosystem partners) negatively impacts financial 
and non-financial performance, disrupt business operations, and result in reputational 
damage.
Major infrastructure projects in certain key markets have increased opportunities to enter 
teaming arrangements with third parties, requiring Arcadis to effectively manage the risks 
around such arrangements.
Health & Safety
Risk Description 
Health and safety incidents or other crises adversely affect our people and our business, 
resulting in harm to employee(s), personal liability, financial loss, and reputational damage.
Arcadis’ core business activities remained substantially the same in 2022; thus, the risk of 
health and safety incidents has not significantly changed this year.
How Arcadis Manages the Risk
1. A Global Procurement function and Ecosystem Partnerships team serve the global business operating model of the 
organization, strengthening the ability to select third parties that are financially stable and align with Arcadis business 
principles and core values, including integrity, human rights, and sustainability.
2. An Engaging with Third Parties standard defines the minimum requirements around selecting and contracting with third 
parties. The standard supports successful engagement with third parties to deliver great outcomes for Arcadis and its 
clients.
3. Sustainable procurement training is provided to our Procurement function.
4. Arcadis has used tooling to assist in screening and monitoring third parties. We continue to mature this within the 
organization, aiming to standardize this process.
5. A Global Procurement Policy and Supplier Code of Conduct includes a focus on sustainability and human rights 
considerations to achieve alignment with Arcadis’ strategy. Using ISO 20400, Arcadis continues to enhance its sustainable 
procurement practices. 
How Arcadis Manages the Risk
1. H&S leaders are embedded in the GBA management teams, supported by the Global H&S Director, the Global Operations 
Project Services officer and the COO.
2. The global H&S management system is underpinned by a set of standards and procedures defining a common approach to 
H&S across the organization.
3. The online delivery of monthly H&S communication campaigns, Global Health & Safety Day, Take Time for Safety calls, and 
Track to Zero Awards successfully promote the Arcadis H&S culture to employees. Monthly campaigns increase awareness 
across the organization. 
4. An Employee Wellbeing and Resilience leader manages employee mental health and well-being programs across the 
global organization.
5. H&S concerns regarding potential projects are raised at an early stage during the Go/No-Go process. This enables the H&S 
function to provide consistent input and H&S controls to be scoped and priced into projects.

Liquidity & Working Capital Management
Risk Description 
The business cannot fund its operations due to insufficient free cash flow. 
This risk is a key area of focus as we integrate acquisitions completed in 2022. A period of 
sustained growth requires Arcadis to retain its sharp focus on cash conversion to sustain its 
cash performance.
Financial Reporting
Risk Description 
Financial statements contain material misstatements, leading to a loss of confidence in the 
accounts by key external and internal users.
As a globally operating publicly listed company, Arcadis must comply with financial 
reporting requirements. Material misstatements in reporting could significantly affect 
Arcadis’ reputation and/or its stock market value. 
How Arcadis Manages the Risk
1. Arcadis runs a centrally controlled program across all GBAs, focusing on unbilled, aged, and overdue receivables. Monthly 
reviews are performed with business leadership, and a formal escalation process is in place when required.
2. Using analytical reports facilitates monitoring, identification of changes required in commercial behavior, and operating 
procedures to better manage net working capital.
3. Free cash flow is forecast and monitored against the plan each month.
4. Account leaders are accountable for the payment performance of their clients, with weekly monitoring and actions/
escalation taken where required.
5. Leadership incentive structures are updated throughout the year in response to our cash targets.
How Arcadis Manages the Risk
1. A central Group Reporting function led by the Chief Accounting Officer oversees and supports financial reporting across 
all entities within the group. Global business process owners lead standardization and automation of processes. 
2. Continuous monitoring of upcoming and effective changes in accounting and/or reporting standards, laws, and 
regulations, and periodic discussions of comprehension and compliance with senior finance leaders and supervisory 
functions. It is critical that all subsidiaries report to the same standards and deliver the same transparent, high-quality 
reporting, consistent with accounting and reporting principles applicable to Arcadis NV (IFRS as adopted by the EU).
3. Assessment of cross-functional financial risk and control matrices to support changing financial accounting and reporting 
processes allows assurance activities to underpin the accuracy, timeliness, and reliability of internal and external financial 
reporting.
4. PWC is appointed as the external auditor for the Arcadis group. The Independent Auditor’s Report on page 254 reflects 
the significant Key Audit Matters as identified by the external auditor.

Information Technology 
Risk Description 
Critical IT systems are unavailable or have restricted availability to the business leading to 
loss of operational functionality and business disruption is a constant threat to Arcadis.
As Arcadis advances its digital strategy, development of software and technologies to 
support Arcadis’ innovative digital solutions requires the management of risks that, if not 
mitigated effectively, could impact the availability and quality of those solutions.
 
Information Security
Risk Description 
Information security risks continue to present a threat to daily business activities. 
Threats are rapidly changing and constantly evolving, and the potential impact increases as 
Arcadis fulfils its digital ambitions, and bad actors becoming more sophisticated. Market 
expectations continue to increase, with regulators and clients taking a greater interest in 
how organizations protect their data and choose to do business with organizations having 
the best security ratings.
How Arcadis Manages the Risk
1. A global technology operating model is in place which defines clear ownership and standardization of core technology 
processes, complemented by a technology function-wide risk assessment and management plan.
2. A centralized technology asset management system facilitates the Infrastructure Operations Center (IOC) activities to 
scan, monitor, and remediate any vulnerabilities or performance issues identified in the Arcadis network. 
3. Developers use software development tools to manage the quality of code as it is developed and position fully tested and 
approved code for promotion to production. 
4. Our Citizen Development program enables Arcadians to use low-/no-code platforms to automate project-based challenges 
in a safe and controlled manner. 
5. Arcadis has moved from an external hosting contract to take direct control of its cloud environments and transform 
network services with greater reliability and scalability. 
How Arcadis Manages the Risk
1. A Global Information Security Officer leads an information security team positioned independently from technology and 
reporting directly to the ELT regarding information security risks. Additionally, the Information Security Committee, which is 
chaired by the CEO, oversees the organization’s information security risk posture.
2. Arcadis continues to strengthen its security incident response and executes cyber-attack exercises to test response 
capabilities.
3. Arcadis runs a dedicated awareness campaign to teach all Arcadians in the world to recognize sophisticated phishing emails 
and report these.
4. ISO 27001 and Cyber Essentials Plus certifications have been obtained for certain geographies with additional certifications 
planned for 2023.

Sustainability
Risk Description 
Arcadis does not contribute effectively to advancing sustainable development. 
Society, shareholders, and markets demand that companies act responsibly and deliver 
sustainable products and services. Failure to incorporate sustainability into its client 
solutions and its own operations could result in Arcadis failing to maximize its impact.
Regulatory & Policy Compliance Risk
Risk Description 
Non-compliance with external laws and regulations in applicable jurisdictions in which 
Arcadis operates or with internal company standards, policies, or guidelines, resulting in 
penalties, claims, or reputational damage.
Arcadis is experiencing an increasing need to provide positive assurances to external 
stakeholders, including clients, ecosystems, and investors, regarding ESG-related topics. 
Additionally, rising expectations around third-party due diligence, especially related to 
sanction laws, increase the risk.
How Arcadis Manages the Risk
1. The Chief Sustainability Officer drives strategic impact across the business, amplifying achievements and accelerating the 
implementation of the sustainability ambition and strategy. The central sustainability function works directly with GBAs to 
build sustainability into client solutions and services. Additionally, the Sustainability Advisory team offers its expertise on a 
global scale, supporting the clients and communities we serve.
2. The Supervisory Board's Sustainability Committee drives improved governance. To foster leadership engagement, Arcadis 
includes ESG risk management ranking as a performance criterion in the long-term incentive remuneration for ELT members. 
3. Arcadis sets targets and measures performance to reduce its environmental impact from business operations across the 
organization, using the ISO 14001 Environmental Management System standard. A science-based target approved by the 
Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi) covers Arcadis’ operations and is aligned with the 1.5°C global warming target limit 
above pre-industrial levels.
4. The EU taxonomy, a classification system established to clarify environmentally sustainable investments, is being adopted 
across all Arcadis solutions. Additionally, the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) facilitates our 
assessment of the risks of climate change to our business.
How Arcadis Manages the Risk
1. The Legal, Compliance and Privacy function is aligned to provide the GBAs with effective business partnering. 
2. The Global Compliance Officer, supported by a team of appointed privacy and compliance officers provides governance and 
management systems strengthening the global businesses and enabling functions.
3. Arcadis does business in accordance with the AGBP, laws, regulations, accounting standards, governance and periodic filing 
requirements, applicable in the jurisdictions in which it operates. The AGBP was reviewed for societal, legislative, and other 
developments and refreshed in 2022 to also include a code of conduct. Training was rolled out across the entire organization 
with completion of training monitored. 
4. The Global Integrity and Anti-Corruption Program supports the global business leadership to maintain focus on integrity, 
remain accountable, and to enhance the culture of integrity and a safe “speak-up” culture.

Management statements
As a result of the Risk Assurance Program testing carried out in 2022, the GBAs and enabling functions 
issued signed Documents of Representation and In-Control statements to the Executive Board. This 
process is in line with the Risk Assurance Program as described on page 133. In 2022, both IBI Group 
and DPS Group (acquired in Q3 and Q4 respectively) were required to also issue signed Documents of 
Representation and In-Control statements to the Executive Board.
The Executive Board, supported by the ELT, has reviewed the Documents of Representation and  
In-Control statements, along with reports from Internal Audit and the external auditor. Other than the 
impact of companies acquired, there were no significant changes in the internal risk management and 
control systems during 2022. It has assessed the effectiveness of the design and operation of the ARC 
Framework in 2022 and discussed with the Audit and Risk Committee and the Supervisory Board.
During 2022, no significant weaknesses in the design or implementation of the controls under the ARC 
framework were observed (i.e. no deficiencies that resulted in material losses or impact). Where a control 
did not operate as expected, areas for improvement were identified, remedial action plans were 
formalized, and progress against the plans was monitored throughout 2022. 
As substantiated in this Enterprise Risk Management chapter of the Annual Report, based on the 
information referred to above and its assessment, the Executive Board believes that:
1.  The Annual Report provides sufficient insights into any significant deficiencies in the effectiveness of 
the internal risk management and control systems;
2.  The aforementioned systems provide reasonable assurance that the financial reporting does not 
contain any material inaccuracies;
3.  Based on the current state of affairs, it is justified that the financial reporting is prepared on a going 
concern basis; and
4.  The Annual Report states those material risks and uncertainties that are relevant to the expectation 
of the company’s continuity for the period of twelve months after the preparation of the report. See in 
particular the Key Risks table on page 135.
In accordance with Article 5:25c of the Financial Markets Supervision Act (Wet op het Financieel Toezicht), 
the Executive Board confirms, to the best of its knowledge, that:
• The Consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit and loss of Arcadis and its consolidated companies;
•  The Annual Report gives a true and fair view of the position as at 31 December 2022 and the 
developments during the financial year of Arcadis and its group companies included in the consolidated 
financial statements; and
•  The Annual Report describes the main risks Arcadis is facing in the Key Risks table on page 135.
The above statements are given on the basis that the ARC framework is primarily designed to bring 
Arcadis’ risk exposure within its appetite and cannot therefore provide full and complete assurance that all 
human error, unforeseen circumstances, material misstatements, fraud, or non-compliance with laws and 
regulations will be prevented.

The
Challenge

The
Impact
Coffs Harbour is one of the largest urban centres on the Australian Mid 
North Coast, with a growing population of around 75,000. However, as 
one of only two locations on the entire eastern corridor where the link 
road between Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane passes through an urban 
area, it is prone to extremely high levels of congestion. At 14km, the Coffs 
Harbour Bypass seeks to reduce this pressure. It is the last section of the 
20 year long Pacific Highway Upgrade to be completed, and aims to 
improve connectivity, transport efficiency and safety for all road users. 
Arcadis is lead designer for the Ferrovial Gamuda Joint Venture (FGJV), 
which was awarded the $1.35 billion major works contract for the new 
bypass. This design and construct contract includes four lanes of divided 
motorway and three tunnels at major ridgelines around Coffs Harbour. 
Arcadis is harnessing digital advances to create sustainable, data-led and 
connected highway solutions, where the design incorporates a range of 
measures to minimize impact on biodiversity and restore ridgelines and 
other areas with native forests. Crucially, the route design has excluded 
over two hectares of wet sclerophyll rainforest where new plants species 
have been found. The design also considers the fact that Coffs Harbour is 
renowned for high intensity rainfall and localised flooding, and so the 
bypass will be constructed to convey any extreme water flows safely 
across the highway while safeguarding existing flood mitigation strategies. 
The upgrade is expected to take approximately 12,000 vehicles out of 
the centre of town every day. It will help motorists avoid up to 12 sets 
of traffic lights and effectively cut travel time by 12 minutes. 
Thanks to extensive experience and learnings from the delivery of five 
previous sections of the Pacific Highway upgrade over the last decade, 
Arcadis is able to help the Australian and New South Wales Governments 
maximize benefits for all road users and the surrounding community. 
Journeys will be easier, faster and safer, all while supporting local 
community welfare and the preservation of the environment.

 “ Design measures ranging from generous bridge spans and drainage 
solutions that reduce the risk of erosion and blockage, to a pavement 
design that adopts asphalt with an innovative binder to increase stiffness 
and resistance to fatigue, are all solutions that keep sustainability at the 
forefront of design and focus on reducing carbon footprint. ”

Report by the Supervisory Board
Arcadis NV has a two-tier Board structure, consisting of the Executive Board and the Supervisory 
Board, both with distinct tasks and responsibilities for the Company and its stakeholders. The task 
of the Executive Board is to manage the Company and to realize its objectives and strategic goals. 
The task of the Supervisory Board is to supervise and advise the Executive Board.
2022 was the second year of the implementation of the ‘Maximizing our Impact’ strategy; a strategy that is 
helping the Company’s clients navigate the complex and varied palette of challenges and opportunities they 
are facing in today’s uncertain world. The war in Ukraine, its impact on the world economy, the climate crisis, 
and the continued impact of COVID-19 on the Company, its people and its clients have made for a 
challenging year. Thanks to the remarkable talent, focus and dedication of Arcadians around the globe, the 
Company was able to further improve its financial performance and make great strides towards delivering 
its strategic targets. 2022 was also a year of transformation for Arcadis itself, during which the Supervisory 
Board was closely involved in the implementation of the Global Business Area (GBA) structure - Resilience, 
Places and Mobility; the acquisitions of IBI Group, DPS Group, HydroNET and Giftge Consult; and the 
creation of the fourth GBA - Intelligence. 
At the outset of 2022 the Supervisory Board identified the themes it considers most important in light of 
the Company’s strategy for long-term sustainable value creation, and the Board’s supervisory and advisory 
role. These Supervisory Board priorities 2022 are set out below and formed the common thread of the 
Supervisory Board’s discussions and deliberations in 2022. This Report by the Supervisory Board sets out 
the way the Supervisory Board fulfilled its duties and responsibilities. It describes the Supervisory Board 
priorities 2022 in more detail, it details progress made against them and dilemmas encountered (priorities in 
bold below).
The Company’s strategy, the Supervisory Board Priorities 2022 and Our Role as 
Supervisory Board
1. Contain and improve attrition 
2. Institutionalize the GBA Operating Model and deliver on 2022 plan
3. Maintain confidence of investor base 
4. Further improve performance of CRTKL, for integration of architectural business into Places GBA
5.  Maintain momentum on ESG, including deployment of detailed net zero roadmap and  
implementation of non-financial reporting 
6. Deploy M&A strategy aligned with GBA strategy and goals
7. Succession planning
Containing and improving attrition was high on the Supervisory Board’s agenda in 2022. Each meeting, the 
Chief Operating Officer and the Chief People Officer provided an update on the Company’s efforts regarding 
resourcing and retention. Four key attention areas were (i) talent and acquisition (including how to reduce 
the lead time for new hires and improve their onboarding experience) (ii) resource planning (including how 
to increase the use of forecasting and scenario planning) (iii) retention (including how to further improve 
and simplify the promotion process at Arcadis) and (iv) billability. Regarding retention, data from employee 
engagement surveys consistently confirmed the importance of the capability, stability, and capacity of (in 
particular mid-level) line management, which was addressed as a priority. Targeted actions were identified 
and implemented, led by joint People and business teams. These efforts contributed to overall attrition 
stabilizing throughout the year. The meeting also regularly discussed employee engagement scores and was 
pleased to see improvement throughout the year.

Report by the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board was closely involved in the institutionalization of the GBA Operating Model. 
Each of the three GBA Directors presented their respective visions, ambitions and challenges to the 
Supervisory Board. At each subsequent meeting of the Supervisory Board, progress was discussed and 
challenges were addressed. Considering the magnitude of the program and its far-reaching ripple effects, 
a wide variety of topics were tabled, including collaboration between the GBAs, creating one way of working, 
ownership for performance and growth, connecting the skills of Gen and CRTKL with the GBAs, the 
transformation of the enabling functions, how to address resistance to change, and the need for clear 
communication and transparency. The Supervisory Board and the Executive Board regularly discussed the 
importance of keeping client focus and collaboration front and centre, also in times of transformation. 
The Supervisory Board strongly supports the appointment of Edel Christie, Chief Transformation Officer, 
to the Executive Leadership Team.
Client focus and collaboration, and the resulting strong and predictable financial performance in 2022 led to 
Arcadis maintaining the confidence of the Company’s investor base. Each meeting, the Supervisory Board 
discussed the financial performance of the Company's GBAs. Healthy organic and profitable growth, solid 
margins and record backlogs were the result of a relentless focus of Arcadians around the globe on working 
together to deliver exceptional outcomes for clients. 
The Supervisory Board also discussed the actions taken by the ELT and GBA management to get CRTKL 
back on track. The Supervisory Board fully supports combining the strengths of IBI Buildings and CRTKL as 
an integral part of GBA Places, under the experienced leadership of Mansoor Kazerouni.
Major strides were made to maintain momentum on ESG, as was also demonstrated by the Company’s 
continued excellent ESG rankings in 2022. Sustainability is embedded into the operations of Arcadis around 
the globe (for example, key sustainability questions are included into the Company’s client selection 
framework), and the company has worked hard on putting a more mature, comprehensive and transparent 
non-financial reporting system in place. The Supervisory Board remains impressed with the Company’s bold 
commitment to its net zero journey, sustainability KPIs and to ESG standards more broadly. 
More information about the activities of the Supervisory Board's own Sustainability Committee in 2022 
can be found below. 
The Supervisory Board fully supports the Company’s implementation of its M&A strategy in 2022. 
The Supervisory Board is confident that the acquisitions of IBI Group and DPS Group and the resulting 
creation of the new Architecture and Urbanism division in GBA Places and the fourth GBA: Intelligence 
will help accelerate the delivery of the Company’s strategy. The coming together of these companies will 
create exciting new opportunities for Arcadis’ clients and its people. The Supervisory Board advised the 
Company in all stages of the acquisitions of IBI Group and DPS Group; from early discussions to due 
diligence to negotiation of transaction terms. The integration of the acquired companies will be one of the 
Supervisory Board’s priority topics in 2023. The Supervisory board also received regular updates on the 
divestments completed in 2022. 
In Q4 2022, the Supervisory Board started a deep dive into the Company’s long-term technology strategy, 
looking at (the pace of) digitalization and technology trends in the architecture, engineering and 
consultancy sector and taking into account the addition of IBI Group to the group. The meeting looked at 
digitalization progress within Arcadis and how to further scale up value creation through digitalization 
and maximize digital impact by creating a fourth GBA: Intelligence. 
The Supervisory Board is encouraged by the work done in 2022 regarding diversity and inclusion and 
succession planning. It also recognizes that a lot of work remains to be done. In 2022, The Supervisory 
Board received regular updates on talent and diversity efforts. The Supervisory Board regularly discussed 
emergency, medium- and long-term Executive Board, Executive Leadership Team and Supervisory Board 
succession planning, the diversity of candidates in the succession pipeline, and the need to perform a 
succession gap analysis. The Supervisory Board will remain closely involved with succession planning 
in the coming years.
Regarding health and safety, apart from the obvious attention for the enduring impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic, in particular in Asia, we continued to start each meeting with an update on a Health & Safety 
topic or statistics and/ or a Health & Safety moment, with special attention for the mental health of 
Arcadians in these challenging times. By sharing experiences and suggestions the Supervisory Board 
continues its stewardship of the topic and contributes to further awareness and improvement. 
The Supervisory Board is pleased with the Company’s H&S performance in 2022.

Report by the Supervisory Board
Supervisory Board meetings 2022: other topics discussed 
In 2022, the Supervisory Board held five regular scheduled meetings. All our meetings were attended by the 
members of the Executive Board and the members of the Executive Leadership Team. We also had five 
‘Supervisory Board-only’ meetings. In addition to these regular scheduled meetings, three intermediate calls 
were scheduled. All three intermediate calls focused on the Company’s M&A and divestment activities and 
the financing thereof. 
In each of our scheduled meetings we discussed progress against the Supervisory Board priorities listed 
earlier in this Report, as well as topics that we address every meeting, including financial performance, 
important project wins, the functioning of the Company’s governance (including the aforementioned 
succession planning and remuneration) Internal Audit (including the approval of the Internal Audit plan 
2022) and Risk Management. To mirror the Client and Project focus of Arcadis, business leaders from around 
the globe were regularly invited to present on the work performed for specific key clients. Furthermore, IT 
and information security topics, legal developments, claims and claim related trends, Integrity, Compliance 
and the Integrity and Anti-Corruption program and privacy topics were discussed.
In December, the Supervisory Board discussed the Plan 2023 and the Company’s approach to the strategy 
refresh (2024-2026 cycle); the Supervisory Board will be closely involved in each of the steps that comprise 
the refresh cycle. The Company will use a 10-15 year vision and a five year strategy roadmap to get to a 
more defined three-year strategy. The Supervisory Board emphasized the importance of scenario testing 
and risk workshops with business leaders, to ensure alignment between, inter alia, the 2024-2026 strategy 
and budgets. 
Supervisory Board meetings 2022: attendance
The attendance percentage for the full Supervisory Board meetings in 2022 was 100% (2021: 100%), for 
Supervisory Board-only meetings 100% (2021: 100%), for Audit and Risk Committee meetings 100% (2021: 
100%), for Remuneration Committee meetings 100% (2021: 100%), for Selection Committee meetings 
100% (2021: 100%) and for meetings of the Sustainability Committee also 100% (2021: 100%).
Next to interaction during Supervisory Board meetings, one-on-one discussions between Supervisory Board 
members and members of the Executive Board, the Executive Leadership Team and other senior leaders 
and functional heads took place throughout the year.
Finally, we like to mention that all Supervisory Board members and Executive Board members, as well as 
one Executive Leadership Team member (Mary Ann Hopkins), are members of the board of the Priority 
Foundation, the holder of the Priority shares in the capital of Arcadis. Ten Arcadis employees from across the 
organization make up the other half of the board of the Priority Foundation. As a group, these ten 
employees are joined up in the board of the Bellevue Foundation. The board of the Priority Foundation 
came together three times in 2022, inter alia to discuss Arcadis current affairs and to approve the acquisition 
of IBI Group. Reference is made to note 26 of the Consolidated financial statements for further information 
on the Priority Foundation and the Bellevue Foundation.
Functioning of the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board and the Executive Leadership Team
At the end of each scheduled Supervisory Board meeting, the members of the Supervisory Board evaluated 
the meeting amongst ourselves. Annually we perform assessments of the functioning of the Supervisory 
Board, the Supervisory Board Committees and the individual Supervisory Board members. In December 
2022, we performed these assessments with two structured questionnaires prepared in co-ordination with 
the Company. As always, the assessment of the functioning of the Chair of the Supervisory Board was led by 
the Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board. 
In conclusion, we noted that the Supervisory Board continues to be a safe environment for open and 
constructive discussion. The relationship with the Company’s leadership is good. Although the Supervisory 
Board’s close involvement in many topics is seen as adding much value, the Board did discuss how to keep the 
appropriate distance to maintain the required helicopter view. This will be kept under review going forward. 
The members of the Supervisory Board have welcomed the return of in-person meetings and are pleased with 
the balance struck between in-person and (more cost-efficient and sustainable) virtual meetings. Overall, we 
are pleased with the quality of the information we receive from the Company. There remains room for further 
improvement in making presentations to the Supervisory Board less of a knowledge transfer and more of a 
dialogue around, for example, dilemmas encountered. The Supervisory Board recognizes the need to further 
bolster its knowledge of digital, IT and Information Security matters. In the search for new Supervisory Board 
members, extensive experience in these fields is high on the Board’s wish list.

Report by the Supervisory Board
As in past years, in the Board meetings each of the Supervisory Board members takes responsibility that 
certain specific attention areas/ topics are addressed. This helps ensure that we give the topics the required 
attention and optimize our respective expertise. In our evaluation we re-emphasized that Executive 
Leadership Team members are encouraged to reach out to ‘their’ Supervisory Board member proactively 
throughout the year.
In February 2022 we set personal targets for the Executive Board. During the year we monitored the 
performance of the Executive Board and the individual Executive Board member(s) in our Supervisory 
Board-only meetings. In February 2023 we assess the performance of the Executive Board, the two 
Executive Board members and the Executive Leadership Team in 2022. Following the discussions during  
the year, and following the assessments early 2023, we have provided or will be providing feedback to all 
involved. The Supervisory Board has concluded that its relationship with the Executive Board and Executive 
Leadership Team is an open and constructive one, whilst remaining sufficiently critical. This is considered 
essential to having the Executive Board, Executive Leadership Team and Supervisory Board function 
properly.
Composition Supervisory Board, Executive Board and Executive Leadership Team
On 31 December 2022, the Supervisory Board consisted of six members, the Executive Board of two 
members and the Executive Leadership Team of seven members (including two Executive Board members). 
For information about diversity in our Supervisory Board we refer to the chapter on Corporate Governance 
in this Annual Integrated Report. For the current composition of the Executive Board, the Executive 
Leadership Team and information about its members, please refer to pages 116 and 117 of this Annual 
Integrated Report. For the current composition of the Supervisory Board, its Committees, and information 
about its members, please refer to pages 118 and 119 of this Annual Integrated Report.
During the General Meeting in 2022, Mr. Putnam was re-appointed for a period of four years. Mr. Lap 
succeeded Mr. Hoek as Chair of the Supervisory Board.
Corporate Governance
In the chapter on Corporate Governance in this Annual Integrated Report, the governance structure of the 
Company is described, and we explain the one deviation from the principles and best practice provisions of 
the Corporate Governance Code. The Supervisory Board meets the requirements of the Code regarding the 
independence of its Chair, of the other Supervisory Board members, and of the Supervisory Board as a 
whole. The Supervisory Board also complies with the best practice provision that its members do not hold 
more than five supervisory board positions at certain ‘large’ (listed) companies or entities. The Executive 
Board members do not hold more than two supervisory board positions with such companies. 
The Supervisory Board took note of the publication of the updated Dutch Corporate Governance Code in 
December 2022 and welcomes its increased focus on sustainability, diversity and inclusion. In 2023, the 
Supervisory Board will be working closely with the Company on implementing changes required to existing 
Company policies and processes, if any. 
During 2022, no material transactions involving conflict of interest occurred for Executive or Supervisory 
Board members and no material related party transactions as referred to in section 2:169.1 Dutch Civil Code 
were entered into.
Supervisory Board Committee reports
Audit and Risk Committee report
M. Lap (Chair until AGM 2022), D. Goodwin (Chair since AGM 2022), N. Hoek, M. Putnam
In 2022, the Audit and Risk Committee (AARC) met seven times. There were four regular meetings, all 
attended by the CEO, the CFO and the internal and external auditors. Three intermediate calls allowed for 
deep dives into priority topics. Two deep dives were attended by the CEO and the CFO, and one deep dive 
was attended by the CFO only.

Report by the Supervisory Board
The Chair of the Committee had regular meetings with the CEO and the CFO, but also with the external 
auditor and the Head of Internal Audit, the Head of Risk Management, the Global Compliance Officer and 
the Global Company Secretary to discuss focus items like financial performance, business risks, claims, 
compliance and other matters. It is customary that the Committee shares its main deliberations and 
findings in the Supervisory Board meeting immediately following the AARC meeting.
This year, the topics of the deep dives included M&A financing, Non-Financial Reporting (including EU 
Taxonomy), the alignment of the Finance function to the new GBA operating model, a Q4 deep dive into 
PwC’s IT audit findings and a closer look at the Company’s efforts to rationalize the number of legal entities 
in its group. These deep dives have proven very effective and insightful and will therefore remain a fixture 
on the AARC’s rolling agenda.
The financial performance of the Company remained the common thread of the Committee’s discussions 
and activities throughout 2022. Each meeting, the AARC reviewed the financial results per GBA, billability, 
the performance on important projects, and it discussed goodwill allocation, also in light of the new 
operating model. DRO and the continued importance of cash collection, checks and balances in the 
financial control framework, and attrition as a risk factor were recurring agenda items, as was IT user life 
cycle management. Special attention was given throughout the year to non-financial reporting, to the 
implementation of the Arcadis Way and to the topic of Information Security. 
The Company’s Chief Information Security continued to provide quarterly updates to the AARC alongside 
the Chief Technology Officer. Technology topics discussed in 2022 include a regular review of the Tech risk 
register, Tech spend (including the spend on innovation and digitalization versus the spend on daily 
operations). Information Security topics discussed in 2022 include progress on implementing the 
Information Security roadmap, key risks and vulnerabilities and the Company’s readiness to respond to 
cyberthreats, and culture and behaviour. The AARC discussed the lessons learned from Information Security 
awareness month, which was held in June and included a wide variety of (phishing) tests, training sessions, 
awareness raising and a mandatory e-learning around the globe.
In each meeting, in the presence of the Head of Internal Audit the past quarter's main internal audit findings 
and management follow-up were discussed and progress made against the annual internal audit plan was 
discussed. This year, particular areas of focus included Information Security, the quality of management 
follow-up on reported observations and the embedding of privacy controls in business processes. The Head 
of Internal Audit also presented the Committee with the positive outcome of a self-assessment on 
compliance with the requirements that the Dutch Corporate Governance Code imposes on the Internal 
Audit function.
Also in each meeting, in the presence of the Chief Risk Officer, the meeting discussed various risk 
management topics, including a quarterly update on Key Risk Indicators, with special focus in 2022 on global 
economic uncertainty, supply chain and procurement issues, attrition, risks related to the transformation to 
a GBA-led operating model, and the rate of digital transformation, standardization and automation. 
The meeting also regularly discussed, and reported to the Supervisory Board on, the Arcadis Risk Assurance 
Program. The main findings of this annual assessment cycle are discussed in AARC and Supervisory Board 
meetings each year. As an overall conclusion for the year, the meeting confirmed that further progress was 
made on firmly embedding risk management into the way Arcadis works. Arcadis leaders take ownership of 
the key risks, their management and, where necessary, mitigation, and promote an appropriate balance 
between risk appetite and perceived risk exposure.
Further work remains to be done, inter alia, to embed and execute the controls regarding privileged IT 
access, further improve opportunity approval processes in certain jurisdictions, further mature supplier 
selection processes, and improve the consistent quality of execution of the Risk Assurance program.
As is customary, the AARC also evaluated the performance of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the 
Company’s external auditor, and discussed certain improvement areas (for both PwC and the Company). 
PwC also presented its audit plan for 2022, which was discussed and approved. During the July Committee 
meeting, PwC’s half-year review report was discussed. PwC’s key financial reporting risks for 2022 and its 
audit findings, both at mid-year and at year-end, were aligned to the focus items identified by the Committee 
and by the Internal Audit department. They included the accounting impact of the acquisition of IBI Group

and DPS Group, the reallocation of goodwill to the GBAs, non-financial reporting and EU Taxonomy. 
Throughout the year, the Committee discussed and assessed with PwC the progress made regarding its key 
audit findings.
At the end of the year, the Committee evaluated the performance, independence and financial literacy of the 
Committee and its members, with a positive conclusion. 
Like every year, the Committee frequently reviewed and discussed the Company’s quarterly reports on key 
legal claims and pending litigation, as well as claims statistics and trends. There were presentations by the 
Global Tax Director on the Arcadis tax position and tax trends, including upcoming new EU/ OECD rules and 
the impact of the new operating model on the Company’s tax position and processes, and by the Corporate 
Insurance Manager on the Arcadis insurance program (with special attention for the captive cell 
underwriting results) and challenges in the insurance market.
The Committee was kept closely informed on progress made to further embed the Company’s Privacy 
program in the business, including the continued actions to mitigate the consequences of the Schrems-II 
ruling of the European Court of Justice (determining that the EU-US Privacy Shield is invalid as a transfer 
mechanism for EU originating personal data). A global privacy awareness and training campaign was rolled 
out in 2022. The committee furthermore discussed the importance of proper management of data and data 
flows, also in light of the transformation to the GBA-led business model, and of continued privacy awareness 
raising and accountability for privacy across the organization on a day-to-day basis. 
The Committee was also regularly updated on (potential) integrity issues and related statistics, as well as 
on the status of the Integrity and Anti-Corruption program 2022, including the roll-out of a new, global 
AGBP campaign, including mandatory e-learning, to all Arcadians in Q3 2022.
Finally, in the context of the annual results 2022, the meeting discussed and reconfirmed the 
Company’s dividend policy and recommended the dividend proposal of €0.74 per ordinary share to 
the Supervisory Board. 
Remuneration Committee report 
C. Mahieu (Chair), M. Lap (as of AGM 2022), N. Hoek (until AGM 2022), W.G. Ang
In 2022, the Arcadis Remuneration Committee (RemCo) met three times. The CEO, the CPO and the CFO 
were invited to attend (parts of) the meetings. 
In the first quarter, based on the performance assessment of the Executive Board and the Executive 
Leadership Team, the RemCo advised the Supervisory Board with regard to the STI payout. In addition, the 
RemCo advised the Supervisory Board regarding the remuneration of the Executive Leadership Team 
members, based on a benchmark analysis performed.
Other topics that were discussed and advised upon during the RemCo meetings in 2022 include the VWAP 
calculation methodology, the STI metrics for the following year and the requirements for the Annual 
Remuneration report as part of the Arcadis Annual Integrated Report.
Selection Committee report 
N. Hoek (Chair until AGM 2022), M. Lap (Chair as of AGM 2022), C. Mahieu, W.G. Ang
In 2022, the Arcadis Selection Committee (ASC) met two times. The CEO and the CPO attended (parts of) 
these meetings. 
During the first quarter the annual performance of the Executive Board and the Executive Leadership Team 
and succession planning were discussed. During the meeting in the fourth quarter, the committee continued 
the discussion on succession planning and discussed Mr. Ang’s intention to step down as member of the 
Supervisory Board to focus on his activities in Asia. The meeting furthermore discussed the intended 
appointment of new Supervisory Board members. These items will be on the agenda of the annual General 
Meeting in May 2023.

M. Putnam (Chair), D. Goodwin, M. Lap
The Sustainability Committee (SusCo) of the Supervisory Board met four times during 2022. 
In its first meeting the committee was educated on the emerging debate around ESG in relation to how 
Arcadis defines sustainability. It then discussed prioritization of Arcadis rating agency submissions, was 
introduced to the newly established Sustainability Advisory activities, reviewed the LTI sustainability 
performance for 2021 (achievement) and 2022 (target setting), as well as the 2022 Global Sustainability plan. 
In its second meeting it discussed the Education and Engagement Program for Sustainability, co-funded by 
the Lovinklaan Foundation. Measurement of engagement levels was deemed critical. The Science Based 
Targets Initiative (Supervisory BoardTi) approved near-term targets and net zero transition next steps, as 
well as scope 3 emission reduction potential and associated actions were discussed. An update was provided 
on non-financial reporting in relation to emerging legislation such as EU Taxonomy and CSRD.
The third meeting focused on the marketing outlook for sustainability, also in relation to global meetings 
like the UN COPs. The redesigned Go/ No-Go and Key and Emerging Client Sustainability Criteria and 
Processes were reviewed, targeted for rollout into client engagements at the earliest opportunity. The 
committee was presented with how Global Sustainability supports the business with emerging sustainability 
propositions, such as Project Carbon. An update on the net zero transition concluded the meeting.
In its fourth meeting the Sustainability Committee reviewed the new indicators for non-financial reporting 
and the basis for this reporting. It discussed the outcomes of the stakeholder engagement and materiality 
assessment process, and took note of the approach and double materiality methodology. A presentation 
was given on the GBA Places Global Solution: Net Zero Facilities & Sustainable Communities. Finally, the 
performance of Global Sustainability during 2022 was reviewed, including the increases in scores from 
some of the major rating agencies, and a preview of 2023 activities discussed.

The purpose of the remuneration policies is to attract, motivate and retain qualified executives and non-executives. 
The remuneration policies intend set the framework for competitive remuneration, to enable Arcadis to compete 
with companies similar to Arcadis, in terms of size and complexity. The remuneration policies for the Executive Board 
and the Supervisory Board are proposed by the Supervisory Board to the Annual General Meeting, based on the 
advice of the Arcadis Remuneration Committee (‘RemCo’). The current Executive Board remuneration policy was 
adopted in 2021. The current Supervisory Board remuneration policy was adopted in 2020.

Alignment between remuneration and performance of the company
The total remuneration in 2022 for both Executive Board and Supervisory Board is in line with the applicable 
remuneration policies.
 
The total remuneration for the Executive Board consists of fixed remuneration and variable remuneration. 
The short-term incentive financial criteria that were selected for 2022 are EBITA Margin, Free Cash Flow and 
Net Order Intake Key Clients. 
These criteria are directly linked to our Strategy “Maximizing Impact”; accelerating our ability to meet our 
client’s needs driven by the megatrends in the world such as urbanization, climate change, digitalization and 
societal expectations. We aim to create impact through our Sustainable Solutions, our Digital Leadership and 
by leveraging our Focus and Scale. These strategic pillars, support the long-term performance of the 
company. The financial criteria (EBITA Margin and Net Order Intake Key Clients) are directly connected to 
sustainable and profitable revenue growth, while making sure enough free cash flow is generated (i.e. the 
third financial criterion).

To make sure Arcadis has an engaged workforce, the Supervisory Board decided to introduce Employee 
Engagement as the fourth criterion (replacing the Revenue Growth) and as one of two non-financial criteria. 
As Employee Engagement is a leading indicator, this metric was chosen over Voluntary Attrition.
As we continued with the implementation of our strategy in 2022, the success of the transformation has 
been chosen as individual, non-financial fifth criterion for the members of the Executive Board.
For the long-term incentive, the selected criteria Total Shareholder Return, Earnings per Share and 
Sustainability, reflect the long-term performance of the Company. These criteria ensured alignment with 
shareholder interests.
The total remuneration for the Supervisory Board is in line with the remuneration policy for the Supervisory 
Board, as approved by the General Meeting in 2020.
Executive Board remuneration 
Remuneration in line with median level of reference groups
The remuneration policy for Executive Board members aims to support the business strategy, enhance 
the link between pay and performance and align the interests of our Executive Board members with
shareholders’ interests by stimulating share ownership while adopting the highest standards of good 
corporate governance. Remuneration for Executive Board members consists of fixed remuneration, short-
term variable remuneration, long-term variable remuneration and other benefits, such as a pension scheme. 
Variable remuneration is an important part of the total package and is based on performance criteria that 
support long-term value creation.
Arcadis has developed from a multi-local company to a leading global natural and built asset design 
and consultancy company. In order to align with Arcadis’ size (in terms of revenues, average market 
capitalization, total assets and number of FTE), geographic and industry scope, and labor market 
competition, a labor market reference group has been defined . The reference group consists of Dutch 
headquartered companies with significant international activities, supplemented by global industry peers, 
as presented below. 
Dutch headquartered companies with  
significant international activities Global industry peer companies
Aalberts Industries AF Pöyry (FIN)
AkzoNobel RPS Group (UK)
ASM International SNC Lavalin (CAN)
BAM Stantec (CAN)
Boskalis Sweco (SE)
DSM WSP Global (CAN)
Fugro 
SBM Offshore
TKH Group
Vopak
Within this group, Arcadis positions around the median in terms of the average of the aforementioned 
parameters revenues, average market capitalization, total assets and number of FTE.
With the Total Direct Compensation levels (the sum of base salary, short-term variable compensation and 
long-term variable compensation), the Executive Board remuneration policy aims to be at around the 
median of the Total Direct Compensation levels of this reference group.
1  Changes to the reference group may be required from time to time e.g. following mergers or acquisitions in which one or more companies in the reference group are involved.

Internal pay ratio
When developing the remuneration policy for the Executive Board, Arcadis considered the pay ratio within 
the organization. The methodology used, in line with the guidance of the Dutch Monitoring Committee 
Corporate Governance assesses the ratio between the total annual remuneration of the CEO at one hand 
and the average annual remuneration of the employees of the company and group companies whose 
financial data is consolidated by the company at the other hand, where:
•  total annual remuneration of the CEO includes all the remuneration components (such as fixed 
remuneration, variable cash remuneration (short term incentive), the share-based part of the 
remuneration (long term incentive), social contributions, pension, expense allowance, etc.) included in 
the consolidated annual accounts on an IFRS basis;
•  the average annual remuneration of the employees is determined by dividing the total wage costs in 
the financial year (as included in the consolidated annual accounts on an IFRS basis) by the average 
number of FTEs during the financial year; in addition, the hiring of external employees is considered pro 
rata, insofar as they are hired for at least three months during the financial year; and
•  value of the share-based component of the remuneration is determined at the time of assignment in 
accordance with the applicable rules under IFRS.
Based on this new methodology, the following pay ratios are determined:
Year Pay ratio CEO remuneration (€1,000)
2019 29 2,175 
20202 18 1,266 
2021 31 2,244 
2022 28 2,156 
The 2022 CEO pay ratio is slightly lower than the 2021 ratio. This is mainly caused by the fact that the long-
term incentive (LTI) award fair value3 was lower.
Total Direct Compensation Mix
The relative proportion of the annual base salary and the short-term and long-term variable compensation 
components4 of the members of the Executive Board is as follows:
Executive Board member
Annual fixed 
remuneration
Short-term 
Variable
Long-term 
Variable Total
Chief Executive Officer 39% 19% 42% 100%
Chief Financial Officer 40% 20% 40% 100%
The total compensation has a relatively strong focus on long-term remuneration, which reflects the 
importance of alignment with the long-term strategy and long-term value creation of the Company and 
with shareholder interests.
Fixed remuneration
In line with the remuneration policy for the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board determines the base 
salaries of the members of the Executive Board on an annual basis. The Supervisory Board determines the 
base salaries based on benchmarking against the labor market reference group, market movements, salary 
increases of employees and other considerations as are deemed appropriate. The increase of base salaries of 
the members of the Executive Board will not exceed the average increase for employees, unless the 
benchmarking exercise indicates differently.
In 2022, the Supervisory Board decided to increase the fixed compensation for the Executive Board by 4%, 
which is in line with remuneration policy for the Executive Board, i.e. compensation for average increase in 
the market, and in line with the average increase for employees. The following annual fixed remuneration 
levels applied to members of the Executive Board in 2022. 
1 
2 The 2020 pay ratio is significantly lower due to lower value of short term incentive (STI) and long term incentive (LTI) as part of the CEO remuneration. In 2020, the CEO 
informed the Supervisory Board that he decided not to accept the STI payout due to him. In addition, the LTI value at grant was lower due to the lower fair value of the 
grant date. This led to a significantly lower CEO remuneration.
3 In 2021, the period used to determine the VWAP was early 2021, whereas the grant date was in May 2021. This led to a difference in award value and fair value, which 
explains the changing LTI value. This has been adjusted per the 2022 LTI grant.
4 Percentages mentioned are the on-target levels.

For 2023, the Supervisory Board decided to increase the fixed compensation of the CEO and the CFO with 
2%, which is in line with the remuneration policy for the Executive Board, i.e. compensation for average 
increase in the market and in line with the average increase for employees. In view of his retirement, the 
fixed compensation of the current CEO will not be adjusted.

Short-term variable remuneration
The short-term variable compensation serves to incentivize the Executive Board to meet short term 
performance criteria. The short- term variable compensation is a percentage of base salary and ranges from 
0% to 85% of the annual base salary, with 50% being the target. The short-term variable compensation is 
payable in cash. The payment is made in March, the year following the year of review.
No pay out will be made in case none of the performance criteria meet the threshold target. Pay out for 
performance between threshold and targets and between target and maximum is based on a linear 
calculation approach. All short-term variable compensation criteria allow for rewarding strong performance.
Performance criteria STI
To support the Company’s strategy, the criteria for the short-term variable compensation are based on the 
strategy and are partly financial and partly non-financial. Based on the annual priorities of the Company, the 
Supervisory Board determines the performance criteria applicable to the short-term variable compensation 
in their meeting prior to the performance year. 
In line with the remuneration policy for the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board will select from the 
following performance criteria:
1. Financial criteria (minimum 60% weighting):
•  Profit/ Margin
• Revenue/ Growth 
• Cash Flow 
• Capital return measures (such as ROA, ROE, ROIC)
• Economic/ Market value added measures
2. Non-financial criteria:
• Customer results (e.g. net promotor score)
• People & organization (e.g. employee engagement, voluntary turnover) 
• Sustainability (e.g. carbon footprint reduction)
• Individual non-financial criterion (e.g. measuring the success of the implementation of the strategy)
The targets (threshold, target and maximum) for each of the performance criteria will be determined 
annually by the Supervisory Board by reference to the business plan for the respective year and considering 
the strategic aspirations of the Company. 
The actual realization on each of the criteria will be reported in the remuneration report relating to the 
relevant performance year. No payout will be made for meeting a performance criterion in case the 
performance does not meet the threshold target.
The Supervisory Board has the discretion to make adjustments, for example to account for events that were 
not planned when targets were set or were outside of management’s control. The Supervisory Board has 
not applied the derogation clause in 2022.

For performance year 2022, the Supervisory Board selected the following three financial performance 
criteria for the short-term remuneration of the members of the Executive Board:
• Reported EBITA%
• Free Cash Flow
• Net Order Intake Key Clients
In addition, considering the strategic importance of attracting and retaining employees, the Supervisory 
Board selected Employee Engagement as one of two non-financial criteria. The selection of Employee 
Engagement is in line with our strategy as Employee Engagement is an Environmental, Social and 
Governmental (ESG) target. Employee Engagement is measured by the employee Net Promoter Score 
(eNPS), which is measured quarterly. The eNPS score is a rolling average of 12 months. eNPS is measured 
based on our employee engagement survey. Employees complete a questionnaire on a quarterly basis, 
which will lead to the eNPS score.
Finally, the Supervisory Board decided to continue to set an individual (non-financial) criterion to measure 
the success of the implementation of the new strategy. For each member of the Executive Board an 
individual target applied in line with their role in the transformation. The Supervisory Board assessed the 
performance against this individual criterion at the end of the year based on the progress made in 2022.
The weighting of each metric is 20%.
In 2022, the performance of the company against the targets set was as follows. 
Criterion Threshold Target Maximum Realization
Payout as %

Payout as 
% of fixed 
compensation
Reported EBITA % 9.3% 9.8% 10.3% 9,61% 73.4% 7.3%

Employee Engagement 34 36 38 39 170% 17.0%
Realization of Reported EBITA and Free cashflow based on constant currency and perimeter which excludes 
Acquisitions and Divestments. 
The realization on the individual non-financial criterion linked to the transformation for the members of the 
Executive Board was assessed by the Supervisory Board at 170%. The target for the members of the 
Executive Board was developing and implementing the transformation plan. The Supervisory Board 
concluded this target has been overachieved.
The performance on the financial targets, the non-financial criterion Employee Engagement and the 
individual non-financial criterion linked to the implementation of the strategy (as assessed by the 
Supervisory Board) leads to the following payout:

For 2023, the Supervisory Board decided to make a few changes to the performance criteria for short-term 
remuneration. Firstly, Reported EBITA margin will be replaced by Operating EBITA margin. For the 
performance of the business, the Operating EBITA margin is a more appropriate measure. As Arcadis has 
embarked on a number of acquisitions, the focus on Operating EBITA is even more important. In addition, 
the Supervisory Board decided to add a Free Cashflow threshold. The group Free Cashflow threshold needs 
to be met, before any short term variable remuneration is payable.
6 For the 2022 grant, the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) was based on the average share price of five days (9-13 May 2022) prior to 
the actual grant date (16 May 2022).

These changes lead to the following set of criteria:
Financial criteria:
•  Operating EBITA margin %
• Free Cash Flow
• Net Order Intake Key Clients
Non-financial criteria:
• Employee Engagement
• Individual criterion: measuring the success of the implementation of the strategy 
Threshold applying to any short-term remuneration payout:
• Free Cash Flow
All targets will be disclosed in the 2023 remuneration report.
Long-term variable remuneration: performance shares
The long-term variable remuneration aims to align the interests of the members of the Executive Board with 
long-term shareholder’s interests. Therefore, under the remuneration policy, members of the Executive 
Board receive annually conditional performance shares. The conditional performance shares will vest and 
become unconditional after three years and are restricted for another two years after vesting. 
The value of the annual award is determined by a percentage of fixed remuneration. The actual grant is 
determined by the value divided by the applicable Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)6. 
In 2022, the members of the Executive Board received the following Long-term variable remuneration:
 
% of fixed 
remuneration Grant value (in €) VWAP (in €) Number of shares Fair value (in €)
Total IFRS grant 
value (in €)

Performance criteria long-term variable remuneration
In order to support the three strategic pillars of the strategy, the performance criteria are:
•  Total Shareholder Return
•  Earnings per share
•  Sustainability
Each parameter counts for 33.33%.
Performance Criterion 1: Total Shareholder Return
The vesting percentage of the performance shares is conditional upon the achievement of performance 
measured as relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR), which is defined as share price movements including 
dividends, assuming dividends are reinvested over three years.
The TSR performance of Arcadis is measured against the performance of direct competitors. 
Since various companies in the TSR peer group were delisted in the course of 2022 four companies were 
added to the TSR peer group to replace the companies that have been delisted:
Q2  Cardno replaced by NV5 (US)
Q3 Wood Group replaced by Alten (FR)
Q4 RPS Group replaced by Spie (FR)
Q4 Hill International replaced by Fugro (NL)
7 % growth from t0 to tx, divided by # years. The score will be based on the Sustainalytics score of 2025.

The position of Arcadis within the peer group, after three years, determines the final number of conditional 
performance shares that vest and becomes unconditional, in accordance with the following table:
Ranking 14 - 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 
Vesting % 0% 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200%
Performance Criterion 2: Earnings Per Share 
Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) is calculated by applying the simple point-to-point7 method at the end of the 
period. EPS is disclosed in our Consolidated Financial statement and is calculated by dividing the net income 
from operations by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, excluding 
ordinary shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares (i.e. shares purchased to cover 
share/ option plans). Earnings are adjusted for changes in accounting principles during the performance 
period. The Supervisory Board has the discretion to include other adjustments, for example, the account for 
events that were not planned when targets were set or were outside of management’s control. 
The EPS growth target, threshold and maximum are set annually by the Supervisory Board. Given that these 
targets are commercially sensitive, EPS targets and the achieved performance are published in the Annual 
Report after the relevant performance period. 
The following performance incentive zones will be used to define the vesting for this part of the conditional 
grant: 
 < Threshold Threshold Target Maximum
EPS  nil 50% 100% 150%
Performance Criterion 3: Sustainability (Sustainalytics score (ESG)
The sustainability target will be measured by reference to the ‘Management score’ applied to the Company 
by Sustainalytics, a leading independent global Environmental, Social and Governmental (“ESG”) ratings 
firm which provides a robust analytical framework that addresses a broad range of ESG issues and trends 
that have a significant and material impact on industries and companies. Sustainalytics analyzes and rates 
the performance of 16,000+ companies globally across 138 Sustainalytics-defined sub-industry 
classifications. The analysis is made by looking at and weighting the core and sub-industry specific metrics 
to determine the overall ESG Risk performance. 
The following performance incentive zones and targets will be used to define the vesting for this part of the 
conditional grant: 
 < Threshold Threshold Target Maximum
Sustainalytics score  0 50% 100% 150%
Target performance period 2023 - 20258   76.3  77.3  78.3
The target of this performance criterion was set using the Sustainalytics ESG Risk Rating methodology; 
realization will be assessed with the methodology applicable to Arcadis’ Sustainalytics sub-industry  
(‘non-residential construction’) in 2022. Please note the 2023-2025 target is lower than the previous years 
due to Sustainalytics’ methodology being updated to include additional material ESG issues (MEIs) for 
Arcadis’ subindustry in 2022, leading to a change in baseline. Arcadis remains committed to improving its 
own operations in a sustainable fashion and will continue to focus its sustainability efforts on areas that are 
most relevant.
8 The score will be based on the Sustainalytics score of 2025.

The sustainability target includes a wide range of performance objectives in Arcadis’ material ESG issues as 
defined by Sustainalytics. For example: human capital (roll-out of global mentorship program with a 
diversity focus), carbon and environmental management (progress towards achieving our ‘Net-Zero’ target) 
and human rights (implementing a three-year roadmap for embedding human rights standards in our 
operations).

Retirement and other benefits, contracts
Retirement benefits
In 2022, all Executive Board members participated in the Arcadis Netherlands pension plan. This is a 
collective defined contribution plan with the premium based on the ambition of a pension payment. The 
contribution from the participants is 6,64% of the pensionable salary (annual base salary minus offset) for 
the salary part below €114,866 (maximum pensionable salary under Dutch tax legislation). Executive Board 
members participating in the Arcadis Netherlands pension plan also receive an annual cash allowance in 
line with legislation in the Netherlands for the salary above €114,866. The participation of the Executive 
Board members is aligned with the arrangement for employees. 
Other benefits
Executive Board members receive a net fixed expense allowance, as well as other customary fringe benefits, 
including the use of a company car or a mobility allowance. In line with best practice, the company provides 
benefits which the Supervisory Board considers appropriate for a global company which needs to attract 
and retain Executive Board members from different parts of the world. 
Management agreements and severance pay
In line with current Dutch legislation, all Executive Board members work for Arcadis NV under a 
management agreement: Mr. P. Oosterveer9 (appointed in 2017 and reappointed in 2021) has a four-year 
term and Mrs. V. Duperat-Vergne (appointed in 2020) has a term until the general meeting to be held in the 
fourth year after the appointment. They may be entitled to a severance pay with a maximum of one year’s 
base salary. Management agreements with Executive Board members do not contain provisions on 
severance payments in case of termination resulting from a change in control.
Other elements of the remuneration policy
The Dutch Corporate Governance Code contains additional best practices regarding executive 
remuneration. Based on the advice of the RemCo, the Supervisory Board is satisfied that it has complied 
with these additional best practices in 2022. Before setting proposed targets for Supervisory Board 
approval, the RemCo carried out scenario analyses of the possible financial outcomes of meeting target 
levels, as well as maximum performance levels, and how they may affect the level and structure of the total 
remuneration of the members of the Executive Board.
9  Mr. Oosterveer announced in October 2022 that he will retire in May 2023.

Remuneration report
Supervisory Board remuneration
The remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board consists of a fixed 
fee and an attendance fee. Given the nature of the responsibilities of the 
Supervisory Board, the remuneration is not tied to the performance of the 
Company and therefore includes fixed compensation only. In line with the Dutch 
corporate governance code, the members of the Supervisory Board will not be 
rewarded in equity-based compensation.
The remuneration for Supervisory Board members was last adjusted in 2020, based on a benchmark 
analysis by an external advisor of remuneration at Dutch Headquartered companies with significant 
international activities. 
The remuneration of the Supervisory Board members is as follows:
In € Chair Member
Annual fixed remuneration Supervisory Board 85,000 58,000 
Membership AARC 12,000  8,000 
Membership ASC and RemCo 10,000  7 ,000 
Membership of SusCo  8,000  6,000 
In 2020, the General Meeting approved an attendance fee for all Supervisory Board members of €2,500 for 
every visit for meetings that take place outside of the country of domicile of a Supervisory Board member 
and that does not involve intercontinental travel, or €4,000 for every visit for meetings that involves 
intercontinental travel. No attendance fee is paid if the meeting takes place in the country of domicile of  
a Supervisory Board member or if the Supervisory Board member attended the meeting online.
As is deemed necessary, the Supervisory Board may decide to introduce additional committees. The 
annual fixed fee for such additional committee membership(s) will be dependent upon the expected 
number of committee meetings per annum (€2,000 per meeting for the chair, with a maximum fixed 
annual fee of €8,000; and €1,500 per meeting for a member, with a maximum fixed annual fee of €6,000).
Members of the Supervisory Board participating in more than two committees, will only be compensated 
for their membership of the two committees with the highest fees. The combined membership of the 
Remuneration Committee and ASC is considered one committee membership for the purpose of 
remuneration.
Remuneration of Supervisory Board members is not dependent on company results. Supervisory Board 
members are not eligible to receive shares or options as part of their remuneration package. Possible 
share ownership of Arcadis shares by a Supervisory Board member is meant as a long-term investment.

Other information
The Company has not granted any loans, advances or guarantees to Executive or Supervisory Board 
members. The articles of association of Arcadis NV provide current and former Executive Board members 
and Supervisory Board members with an indemnification for all costs and expenses arising from and 
against any claim, action or lawsuit related to actions and/ or omissions in their function as Executive 
Board or Supervisory Board members.

Notes to the Consolidated financial statements
1 General information
Arcadis NV is a public company organized under Dutch law. Its statutory seat is Amsterdam and its principal 
office is located at: 
Gustav Mahlerplein 97
1082 MS Amsterdam
The Netherlands
Arcadis NV and its consolidated subsidiaries (‘Arcadis’ , ‘the Group’ or ‘the Company’) is a leading global Design 
& Consultancy firm for natural and built assets. Applying deep market sector insights and collective design, 
consultancy, engineering, project and management services, the Group works in partnership with clients to 
deliver exceptional and sustainable outcomes throughout the lifecycle of their natural and built assets.
In accordance with Articles 2:379 and 414 of the Dutch Civil Code, the list of subsidiaries and investments 
accounted for using the equity method is filed with the Chamber of Commerce in Amsterdam, the 
Netherlands.
2 Basis of preparation
Statement of compliance
The Consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and in conformity with Part 9 of Book 2 of 
the Dutch Civil Code. In accordance with sub 8 of article 362, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, the Company 
financial statements are prepared based on the accounting principles of recognition, measurement and 
determination of profit, as applied in the Consolidated financial statements. These principles also include the 
classification and presentation of financial instruments, being equity instruments or financial liabilities.
The Consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by the Executive Board and Supervisory 
Board on 16 February 2023. The Consolidated financial statements as presented in this Annual Integrated 
Report are subject to adoption by the General Meeting of Shareholders, to be held on 12 May 2023.
Basis of measurement
The Consolidated financial statements have been prepared on historical cost basis, except for the following 
items, which are measured at a different basis on each reporting date:
• derivative financial instruments and share-based compensation arrangements, which are measured at 
fair value;
• net defined benefit (asset)/liability, which is measured at the fair value of plan assets less the present 
value of the defined benefit obligation; 
• contingent consideration assumed in a business combination, which is measured at fair value; and 
• financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, which are measured at fair value.
For more detailed information on the measurement basis, reference is made to the significant accounting 
policies as included in the relevant notes to the Consolidated financial statements.
Basis of consolidation
The Consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Arcadis NV and its subsidiaries, and the 
Company’s interests in jointly controlled entities and associates. Intra-group balances and transactions, any 
unrealized gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in 
preparing the Consolidated financial statements. Unrealized gains arising from transactions with associates 
and joint ventures are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Company’s interest in the 
investee. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that 
there is no evidence of impairment.

Foreign currencies
Functional and reporting currency
The Consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the Company’s functional and 
reporting currency. All amounts shown in the financial statements are in thousands of euros unless otherwise 
stated. Items included in the financial information of each of Arcadis’ entities are measured using the currency 
of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). If the functional 
currency of a (foreign) subsidiary, joint venture or associate is not the euro, foreign currency exchange 
differences arising from translation are recognized as translation differences in Other comprehensive income 
and presented in the Translation reserve in equity.
Foreign currency transactions 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of entities using the foreign 
exchange rate at transaction date. The functional currency of the foreign entities is in general the local 
currency. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the functional 
currency of the entity using the exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
Exchange rate differences are included in profit or loss. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are 
measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate 
when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a 
foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on 
acquisitions, are translated to euros at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of 
foreign operations are translated into euros using average exchange rates, approximating the foreign 
exchange rates at transaction date.
Translation differences are recognized in Other comprehensive income and presented in the Translation 
reserve in Equity. For subsidiaries not wholly owned, the relevant proportionate share of the translation 
difference is allocated to the non-controlling interests. When a foreign operation is disposed of, in part or in 
full, the relevant amount in the Translation reserve is transferred to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss 
on disposal.
Accounting estimates and management judgements
The preparation of the Consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of 
assets, liabilities, income and expenses as well as the information disclosed. The most significant accounting 
estimates and management judgments are related to:
•  Revenue recognition (‘cost to complete’) and estimate of the variable consideration – see note 7;
• Goodwill impairment testing and assumptions underlying recoverable amount – see note 14;
• Purchase price allocation – see note 6;
• Segment reporting – see note 5;
• Deferred tax recognition and uncertain tax treatments – see note 12;
• Leases- estimating the incremental borrowing rate – see note 16;
• Recoverability of trade receivables – see note 21;
• Contract assets (unbilled receivables), contract liabilities (billing in excess of revenue) and provisions 
for onerous contracts – see note 22;
• Provisions for defined benefit pension obligations – see note 28;
• Recognition and measurement of provisions: key assumptions about the likelihood and magnitude of 
an outflow of resources – see note 29;
• Going concern - see note 32.
The accounting estimates and judgements in preparing the Consolidated financial statements are further 
explained in the relevant notes to the Consolidated financial statements. In general, the judgements, 
estimates and assumptions are based on market information, knowledge, historical experience and other 
factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from 
these estimates.
Judgements, estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to 
accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods 
affected.

Consolidated financial statements
Impairment
The carrying amounts of the assets of Arcadis, other than Contract assets and liabilities, Deferred tax assets 
and Financial instruments, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication 
of impairment. If such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill and other 
assets that have an indefinite useful life are tested annually for impairment, and when an impairment trigger 
is identified.
For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash 
inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or cash-
generating units (CGUs). Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to Groups of CGUs that 
are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
The recoverable amount is the greater of the fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing the 
value in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted to present values using a discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. An impairment 
loss is recognized whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognized in the income statement. Impairment losses recognized regarding CGUs 
are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to CGUs and then to reduce the 
carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.
An impairment loss of goodwill is not reversed. Regarding other assets, an impairment loss can be reversed if 
there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is 
reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would 
have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized.
Financial instruments
Non-derivative financial assets
Financial assets include trade receivables, other receivables and loans and borrowings. Loans, receivables, 
and deposits are recognized on the date they are originated. All other financial assets are recognized initially 
on trade date when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial 
assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have 
been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. 
All financial instruments are initially measured at fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial asset not 
at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. The Group classifies its financial assets as those to be 
measured subsequently at fair value (either through Other comprehensive income or through profit or loss) 
or those to be measured at amortized cost. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial 
assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of the financial assets at initial recognition, 
based on the business model for managing the assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows, and 
assesses the designation at each reporting date.
Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and reported as a net amount in the balance sheet when there is a 
legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis 
or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be 
contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of 
default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company or the counterparty.
Cash flow statement
The Cash flow statement has been prepared using the indirect method. Cash flows in foreign currencies 
have been translated into euros using average exchange rates, approximating the foreign exchange rate at 
transaction date. Exchange rate differences on cash items are shown separately in the Cash flow statement. 
Receipts and payments with respect to income tax and interest are included in the Cash flows from 
operating activities. The cost of acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, and other 
investments, insofar as it was paid for in cash, is included in Cash flows from investing activities. Acquisitions 
or divestments of subsidiaries are presented net of cash balances acquired or disposed of, respectively. Cash 
flows from derivatives are recognized in the Cash flow statement in the same category as those of the 
hedged item.
Recent accounting developments
As of 1 January 2022, the Group adopted the amendments to IFRS 3 relating to the Reference to the 
Conceptual Framework, IAS 16 relating to the proceeds before intended use of property, plant and 
equipment and IAS 37 relating to Onerous Contracts – Costs of Fulfilling a Contract. 
Developments relating to the published exposure draft of the new standard ‘General Presentation and 
Disclosures’ , which is intended to replace IAS 1, are closely monitored.

Onerous Contracts – Costs of Fulfilling a Contract – Amendments to IAS 37
An onerous contract is a contract under which the unavoidable of meeting the obligations under the contract 
costs (i.e., the costs that the Group cannot avoid because it has the contract) exceed the economic benefits 
expected to be received under it. 
The amendments specify that when assessing whether a contract is onerous or loss-making, an entity needs 
to include costs that relate directly to a contract to provide goods or services including both incremental 
costs (e.g., the costs of direct labour and materials) and an allocation of costs directly related to contract 
activities (e.g., depreciation of equipment used to fulfil the contract and costs of contract management and 
supervision). General and administrative costs do not relate directly to a contract and are excluded unless 
they are explicitly chargeable to the counterparty under the contract.
The Group has not been impacted by this recent amendment as the Group is already including such costs 
when assessing whether a contract is onerous or loss-making.
Reference to the Conceptual Framework – Amendments to IFRS 3
The amendments replace a reference to a previous version of the IASB’s Conceptual Framework with a 
reference to the current version issued in March 2018 without significantly changing its requirements. The 
amendments add an exception to the recognition principle of IFRS 3 Business Combinations to avoid the issue 
of potential ‘day 2’ gains or losses arising for liabilities and contingent liabilities that would be within the scope 
of IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets or IFRIC 21 Levies, if incurred separately. 
The exception requires entities to apply the criteria in IAS 37 or IFRIC 21, respectively, instead
of the Conceptual Framework, to determine whether a present obligation exists at the acquisition date. The 
amendments also add a new paragraph to IFRS 3 to clarify that contingent assets do not qualify for 
recognition at the acquisition date.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, the Group applies the amendments prospectively, i.e., to 
business combinations occurring after the beginning of the annual reporting period in which it first applies 
the amendments (the date of initial application). In 2022, the Group has acquired IBI Group and DPS Group 
for which the purchase price allocation exercise will be completed in 2023. The analysis of potential liabilities 
or contingent liabilities will be performed in 2023 applying these amendments whenever applicable.
3 Change in accounting policies 
There are no significant change in accounting policies adopted during the year ended 31 December 2022.
4 Significant events in the current reporting period
The financial position and performance of the Group has been affected by the following events and 
transactions during the reporting period: 
New Global structure model
Early 2022, the Group has announced changes to its operating structure to better serve the needs of the 
market and its growing client base. The changes are in line with its 2021-2023 business strategy to provide 
focus, global scale and strengthen the sustainable and digital offering to clients. 
Therefore, Arcadis has transitioned since 1 January 2022 from a primarily geographical-led operating model, 
to collaborate across borders through global business areas. Four Global Business Areas (GBAs) have been 
set up – Resilience, Places, Mobility and Intelligence. The GBA Intelligence was created in October 2022 and 
combines Arcadis Gen, Intelligence business of IBI Group and other digital activities coming from Arcadis. 
IBI acquisition
On 27 September 2022, Arcadis completed the acquisition of all issued and outstanding shares of IBI Group. 
IBI Group is a Toronto based company and was listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 
IBI Group is a technology-driven design firm that will strengthen Arcadis’ digital leadership, complement its 
position in North America and drive global growth of its combined solutions. This will allow the creation of a 
new global leader for planning, designing and building the resilient cities of tomorrow. IBI Group employs 
more than 3,500 employees within more than 60 offices around the world. 
IBI Group activities have been allocated to the four GBAs of the Group.

DPS acquisition
On 1 December 2022, Arcadis completed the acquisition of all issued shares of DPS Group, an Irish based 
leading consultancy, engineering and construction management company for Life Sciences and 
Semiconductor facilities. DPS has a strong presence in North America and Europe, and long-standing client 
relationships with the world’s largest pharmaceutical and semiconductor manufacturing companies. This 
acquisition will create a full-service advisory for high-tech industrial manufacturing clients, combining DPS 
Group and Arcadis’ complementary service offerings. 
DPS Group is operating with 2,850 highly skilled employees in the U.S. and Europe. DPS will become part of 
Arcadis’ Places GBA. 
Bridge Loan Facility 
Arcadis NV applied for and received a bridge loan facility of EUR 750 million to acquire both IBI Group and 
DPS Group. The first tranche of EUR 600 million was received in Q3 2022 for acquisition of IBI Group, second 
tranche of EUR 150 million in November 2022 for acquisition of DPS. The bridge loan has a term of 1 year 
(maturity in September 2023) of which Arcadis NV has the irrevocable right to extend twice by six months. 
The pricing is based on EURIBOR, with a margin that increases every 3 months.
5 Segment reporting
An operating segment is a component of the Company that engages in business activities that can result in revenue 
and expenses, including revenues and expenses related to transactions with other components of the same Company.
The operating segment reporting follows the internal reporting used by the Executive Board of the Company, to 
manage the business, assess the performance based on the available financial information and to allocate the 
resources. 
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm’s length basis. Segment results, assets and liabilities include items 
directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Reportable segments
The operating segment reporting follows the internal reporting used by the “Chief Operating Decision Maker” 
(“CODM” , being the Executive Leadership Team of the Group), to manage the business, assess the 
performance based on the available financial information and to allocate resources. The most important 
performance measures are EBITA (earnings before interest, tax, amortization of identifiable intangible assets, 
and impairment charges) and operating EBITA, as management believes this is key in evaluating the results of 
the segments relative to other companies that operate within the same industry. However, the “CODM” also 
receives information about the segments’ net revenue. 
Finance expenses, finance income, and fair value change of derivatives are not allocated to individual 
segments as the underlying instruments are managed on a group basis. Current taxes, deferred taxes and 
certain financial assets and liabilities are not allocated to those segments as they are also managed on a 
group basis. 
The amount of segment assets and liabilities is no longer disclosed. Segment assets and liabilities are not 
included in the measures used for allocating resources and assessing segment performance. The Group 
discloses the goodwill by segment (see note 14) which corresponds to the Groups of CGUs for impairment 
testing purpose. Hereafter, the Groups of CGU’s for the purpose of testing for impairment of goodwill, defined 
at the level of the operating segments are referred to as the CGU or the CGU’s (in case of multiple groups of 
CGU’s).
Therefore the information used by the  “CODM”  to monitor progress, and for decision-making about 
operational matters is based on the four GBAs and is no longer based on the geographic basis of the 
operating companies or the specific nature of the services (for CallisonRTKL).
The operating segments are aligned with the new operating model of the Group, effective from the 1 January 
2022, as the Company, has fully organized itself into three Global Business Areas (see page 24 for a 
description of the activities of each of those GBAs). In October 2022 a fourth GBA has been created following 
the acquisition of IBI Group, this led the Group to create the GBA “Intelligence” , after analysis, the Group 
concluded that this GBA constituted an operating segment as for the three other ones. The operating 
segments are equal to the reportable segment and accordingly there is no aggregation applied.

Subsidiaries are all companies over which the Company has control. Control over an entity exists when the Company is 
exposed to, or has right to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control 
commences until the date on which control ceases.
Loss of control
Upon the loss of control, the assets and liabilities, non-controlling interests and other components of equity related to 
the subsidiary are derecognized. Any profit or loss arising on the loss of control is recognized in profit or loss. If a 
non-controlling interest in the subsidiary is retained, such interest is measured at fair value at the date control is lost. 
Subsequently, it is accounted for as an equity-accounted investee or as an available-for-sale financial asset, depending 
on the level of influence retained.
Business combinations
The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when the acquired
set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business and control is transferred to the
Company. In determining whether a particular set of activities and assets is a business,
the Company assesses whether the set of assets and activities acquired includes, at a minimum, an
input and substantive process and whether the acquired set has the ability to produce outputs.
IFRS 3 establishes the following principles in relation to the recognition and measurement of items arising in a business 
combination:
• Recognition principle: Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the acquiree 
are recognized separately from goodwill. Acquired intangible assets must be recognized and measured at fair value 
in accordance with the principles if it is separable or arises from other contractual rights, irrespective of whether 
the acquiree had recognized the asset prior to the business combination occurring. The Group does not recognize 
contingent assets acquired in a business combination.
• Measurement principle: All assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured at 
acquisition-date fair value. 
Goodwill at acquisition date is measured as the fair value of the consideration transferred plus the recognized amount 
of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree less the net recognized amount (fair value) of the identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed.
 
Lease liabilities of acquired leases are measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments as if the acquired 
lease were a new lease at the acquisition date. Right-of-use asset is measured at the same amount as the lease liability, 
adjusted to reflect favourable or unfavourable terms of the lease when compared with market terms. Right-of-use 
assets and lease liabilities for leases for which the lease term ends within 12 months of the acquisition date and the 
underlying asset is of low value are not recognized. 
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such 
amounts are recognized in profit or loss.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities incurred in 
connection with the business combination, are expensed.
Contingent consideration payable is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is 
classified as equity, it is not remeasured, and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes 
to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized in profit or loss.
If the Company obtains control of a business that is a joint operation, it remeasures previously held interests in that 
business.
 
Arcadis NV indirectly holds 100% of the ordinary shares of all these subsidiaries, and does not hold 
direct interests in most of them itself as a result of the intermediate holding structure within the Group. 
All subsidiaries are included in the financial consolidation. The proportion of the voting rights held directly 
by the parent company does not substantially differ from the proportion of ordinary shares held.
At 31 December 2022, the total non-controlling interest amounted to €2.0 million negative 
(2021: €1.1 million negative) and is as such not material for the Group.

Acquisition of IBI Group
On 27 September 2022, the Group acquired 100% of the voting shares of IBI Group Inc., a listed company 
based in Canada. IBI Group is a technology-driven design firm with global architecture, engineering, planning 
and technology expertise. This acquisition aims to create a global leader for planning, designing and building 
the resilient cities of tomorrow. 
For the three months period ended 31 December 2022, IBI Group contributed gross revenue of 
€114.5 million and €2.1 million to loss before income tax. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2022, 
management estimates that consolidated gross revenue would have been €444.8 million, and consolidated 
loss before income tax for the year would have been €7.1 million (excluding amortization of purchase price 
allocation items).

The goodwill is attributable to the workforce and the synergies with the acquired business. It has been 
allocated to the CGUs that the group uses for impairment testing of goodwill: Places, Mobility, Resilience, and 
Intelligence. It will not be deductible for tax purposes.    
Cash settlement of unreplaced awards
In accordance with the terms of the acquisition agreement, the Group has settled in cash the share-based 
payment awards held by employees of IBI Group. These unreplaced awards are considered wholly vested at 
the date of transaction. 
Fair values measurement and provisional purchased accounting
A provisional measurement of backlog for an amount €40.0 million has been recognized within “Other 
intangible assets" using the Multiperiod Excess Earnings Method (MEEM). 
The Group sought an independent valuation for IBI Group’s other intangible assets (mostly technology-
related assets, and customer relationships) that will be performed in 2023. 
The fair value of the trade receivables amounts to €116.9 million. The gross amount of trade receivables is 
€120.7 million, of which €3.8 million was expected to be uncollectable at the date of acquisition. 
The Group measured the acquired lease liabilities using the present value of the remaining lease payments at 
the date of acquisition. The right-of-use assets were measured at an amount equal to the lease liabilities and 
adjusted to reflect the favourable terms of the lease relative to market terms. The right-of-use assets and 
lease liabilities have been measured provisionally and the Group will complete the assessment during the 
measurement period.
The Group has conducted a preliminary assessment of the potential contingent liabilities, including litigations 
and will continue to review these matters during the measurement period.
The net assets recognized at closing date were based on a provisional assessment of their fair value, and the 
Group has one year from the acquisition date to revise preliminary assessed fair values of assets and liabilities.

7 Revenue
Revenue is recognized by the Group following the five-step model in IFRS 15, consisting of:
1. identification of the contract;
2. identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
3. determination of the transaction price;
4. allocation of the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract, and
5. recognition of revenue.
Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes amounts 
collected on behalf of third parties (e.g. VAT). It includes initial amounts agreed in the contract plus any variations in 
contract work and variable consideration, to the extent that it is highly probably that its inclusion will not result in a 
significant revenue reversal in the future when the uncertainty has been subsequently resolved.
The Group recognizes revenue when it transfers control over a product or service to a customer. For performance 
obligations that are transferred over time, revenue is recognized in profit or loss in proportion to the percentage of 
completion of the transaction at reporting date. The percentage of completion is measured by actual (labor) costs 
incurred in relation to total estimated (labor) costs (input method). In the Group’s view this best reflects the value 
delivered to the customer in a business that mainly uses human and intellectual capital (of its employees) for 
completion of the performance obligations towards the customer.
Additional costs because of COVID-19 (e.g. additional labor cost, cost incurred to comply with ongoing health & safety 
requirements) are included in the percentage of completion only if they are needed to contribute to the measure of 
progress of a performance obligation. 
For performance obligations that are transferred at a point in time, revenues and costs are recognized in profit or loss 
when the customer receives the ability to direct the use of the asset and substantially obtains all the benefits of it.
Licenses and Software as a Service
Revenue from (software) licenses is recognized over time, based on time elapsed, in case of a ‘right to access’ . It is 
recognized at a point in time in case of a ‘right to use’ , but not before the beginning of the license period. Revenue from 
Software as a Service (SaaS) is treated as a right to access and is recognized over time, based on time elapsed.
Contract costs and contract cost assets
Contract costs include the costs to fulfil a contract, such as direct labor, costs of materials, services of third parties and 
subcontractors, and costs that are explicitly chargeable to the customer under the contract. They are recognized as an 
asset in Contract assets and liabilities, if they are expected to be recovered.

Board report

Board reportIntroduction Arcadis Annual Integrated Report 2022
Additional

Financial  
statements

Page 190:
Consolidated financial statements
Costs to obtain a contract are only recognized as a contract cost asset in Contract assets and liabilities if they are 
incremental and expected to be recovered. They are recognized on a systemic basis consistent with the recognition of 
costs to fulfill a contract.
Loss provisions
Estimates of project management are used to assess the progress and estimated outcome of a performance obligation. 
When it becomes probable that the total expected costs to complete all performance obligations in a contract exceed 
the total transaction price (consideration) of these performance obligations, a loss provision is recognized for the lower 
of the unavoidable costs and the costs of termination.
Financing component
Arcadis generally does not have any significant contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods 
or services to customer and the payment by the customer, as contractually agreed, exceeds one year. If applicable, the 
transaction price is adjusted for the time value of money. Payments of customers after the agreed payment term are 
covered by the accounting policy on Trade receivables, see note 21.
Agent versus principal
For each performance obligation the Group assesses whether the nature of Arcadis’ commitment is to provide the 
goods and/or services itself, or to arrange for those good(s) and/or service(s) to be provided by another party. Arcadis 
assesses whether it controls the specified good(s) and/or service(s) before it is transferred to the customer.
Arcadis is typically a principal in case of subcontracted work, as Arcadis is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise 
to provide the specified good(s) and/or service(s) and bears primary responsibility for it meeting customer 
specifications and has discretion in establishing the price towards the customer. When Arcadis acts as an agent, only 
the fee/commission is recognized on a net basis in Gross revenues.
Gross versus net revenues
Gross revenues consist of external revenues net of value-added tax, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales 
within the Group. Net revenue is a non-GAAP performance measure, which represents revenue generated by own staff. 
It is a sub-total calculated as Gross revenue minus Materials, services of third parties and subcontractors, which are 
project-related costs of materials and services charged by third parties, including cost of subcontractors.
Disaggregation of revenues
Gross revenues arise from the following major categories:
In € thousands 2022 2021
Revenue from services  3,509,389  2,804,695 
Construction contract revenue  513,580  572,776 
Revenue from licenses  5,966  1,015 
Total Gross Revenue  4,028,935  3,378,486 
Revenues from services rendered represent fee income receivable in respect of services provided during the 
period. Construction contracts include the rendering of services, which are directly related to the construction 
of assets, contracts for the destruction or restoration of assets, and the restoration of the environment 
following the demolition of assets. Revenues from licenses represent fee income receivable in respect of 
allowing customers using Arcadis developed software, and mainly relate to the operating segment Intelligence.

The Other non-current assets relate to long-term retentions. The Expected Credit Loss allowance is included 
in the Contract assets (unbilled receivables) balance, see note 22.
Contract costs
The incremental costs to obtain a contract amounted to nil in 2022 and 2021. The practical expedient of 
paragraph 94 of IFRS 15, stating that those costs can be expensed when incurred if the amortization period is 
one year or less, is not applied.
Transaction price remaining performance obligations
The table below includes revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations 
that are (partially) unsatisfied at the reporting date. The practical expedient of paragraph 121 of IFRS 15 is 
applied, and the table therefore does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that 
have original expected duration of one year or less. The amounts therefore differ from the contracted backlog.

consolidated entities in 2022 (see note 6). No divestments of consolidated entities occurred in 2021. 
The category ‘Other’ in 2022 included amongst others government grants mainly in China of €2.7 million 
(2021: €1.5 million), settlement agreements relating to transfer of staff to a competitor of €3.6 million and 
several other individually non-significant items. The 2021 result was impacted by amongst others refunds of 
social charges paid on severance payments made in the past of €1.0 million, other tax refunds of €1.4 million 
and several other individually non-significant items.

10 Share-based compensation
The Company operates share-based incentive plans. The fair value of equity-settled compensations at grant date 
under the Arcadis long-term incentive plan is recognized as an employee expense (in Salaries and wages), with a 
corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting period. The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect 
the actual number of awards for which the related service and non-market performance conditions are expected to be 
met, such that the amount ultimately recognized as expense is based on the actual number of awards meeting these 
vesting conditions.
The fair value of granted shares subject to a market condition is measured using a Monte Carlo simulation model. 
Measurement inputs include the share price on measurement date, the expected volatility, weighted average expected 
life of the instrument and the risk-free interest rate.
As the fair value is amortized over the vesting period, the costs are recognized in the Income Statement. The 
amortization costs are adjusted for effects of cancelled and forfeited grants. The vesting and exercise of rights to 
acquire shares may be conditional to performance conditions and other conditions, as set by the Supervisory Board.
Long-Term Incentive Plans
To stimulate the realization of long-term Company goals and objectives, Arcadis NV uses Long-Term Incentive 
Plans (LTIPs). Since 2014, securities under LTIPs are solely granted in the form of Restricted Share Units 
(RSUs) and represent an equal number of ordinary shares, subject to meeting the applicable vesting 
conditions. The RSUs will be converted into ordinary shares on the vesting date and are delivered as soon as 
practical thereafter.

RSUs are granted conditionally and depend on achieving/meeting certain conditions during the vesting 
period.
To prevent dilution, (a portion of) the shares required to meet the obligations from exercising LTIPs can be 
purchased by the Company (instead of issuing new shares), with due consideration to the Company’s balance 
sheet, in particular available freely distributable reserves and available cash. Alternatively, shares may be 
issued, whereby it is intended to limit this to 1% of the number of issued shares.
Arcadis NV 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plans
Options and RSUs annually granted to members of the Executive Board and selected senior executives were 
conditional and had a vesting period of three years. Vesting was dependent on performance criteria set forth 
in advance. The granting of such options and RSUs took place each year on or about the second day after the 
Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, whereby the exercise price for the options matched the closing 
price of Arcadis NV shares on the day of the grant.
In 2013, the last awards which will expire in 2023 were granted.
Arcadis NV 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan
In 2014, the Supervisory Board approved the continuation of the Arcadis NV 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan 
in the form of the Arcadis NV 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2014 LTIP). The revised Plan was approved by 
the General Meeting of Shareholders in May 2014.
Shares granted are conditional in nature and depend on, amongst others, attaining a performance measure 
after three years. The performance measure is Total Shareholder Return (TSR), defined as stock price 
appreciation plus dividend yield.
In 2021, the last awards made in 2018 under 2014 LTIP vested.
Arcadis NV 2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan
In April 2019, the Arcadis NV 2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan was approved by the Annual General Meeting. 
Based on this plan the Company can grant equity-settled and cash-settled awards to eligible employees. 
Conditional performance shares granted to Executive Board members must be held for two more years after 
vesting.
 In summary the following applies to these grants:
• Annual grant to Executive Board (EB) and Executive Leadership Team (ELT) members: subject to 
continued employment during the vesting period of three years, and achieving performance conditions 
(1/3 Total Shareholder Return, 1/3 Earnings per share and 1/3 sustainability)
• Annual grant to other employees: subject to continued employment during the vesting period of three 
years; no performance conditions
For EB and ELT members, the position of Arcadis within the peer group, after three years, determines the final 
number of shares subject to meeting a Total Shareholder Return condition (1/3) that vest and become 
unconditional, in accordance with the following performance incentive zone:

the RSUs granted to the EB and ELT members subject to meeting Earnings per share (1/3) and sustainability 
(1/3) conditions were determined by adjusting the share price at the grant date with the present value of 
dividends expected to be paid during the vesting period. The fair value (€35.29) of RSUs granted to EB and 
ELT members subject to meeting a Total Shareholder Return condition (1/3) was determined using a Monte 
Carlo simulation model, which considers the market conditions expected to impact Arcadis’ TSR 
performance in relation to the peer group, and the following assumptions:

 Expected dividend yield (in %) 1.7 1.48
 Risk-free interest rate (in %) 1.22  (0.44)
 Expected volatility (in %) 36.24 39.12
The expected volatility is calculated based on the share price movements of the 36 months prior to grant date.

LTIP costs recognized in 2022
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is calculated by taking the granted RSUs within a 
calendar year multiplied by the fair value of the RSUs at grant date and the expected vesting. This amount is 
expensed over the vesting period, whereby the costs recognized in a year also consider cancellations and 
forfeitures. The expected vesting for RSUs with a Total Shareholder Return performance condition is already 
taken into account in the fair value. 
The expected vesting for the RSUs granted in 2020 to the Executive Board and Executive Leadership Team 
subject to the performance conditions ‘Earnings per share’ and ‘Sustainability’ are estimated at 31 December 
2022 at 150%.
Costs for the LTIP are spread over the vesting period and included in ‘Salaries and wages’ (see note 9). An 
amount of €8.6 million (2021: €5.9 million) is included in the results of 2022 for the share-based 
compensation granted in the period 2019 - 2022.

11 Net finance expenses
Net finance expenses comprise finance income, finance expenses and the fair value change of derivatives at fair value 
through profit or loss. Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and finance expenses comprise 
interest expense on borrowings, and the unwinding of discount on provisions and contingent consideration.
Finance income and finance expenses are recognized in profit or loss, using the effective interest method. The fair value 
changes of derivatives comprise the fair value changes on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, as far as 
these relate to financing items in the Company. These fair value changes are partially offset by the foreign currency 
gains and losses.
Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis as either finance income or finance expense if it concerns 
exchange rate results on financing items. Exchange rate results on operating items are included in Other operational 
costs (see note 9)..

Finance expense  (27,651)  (22,280)
Fair value change of derivatives  (3,795)  (511)
Total  (23,558)  (18,743)
Finance income increased to €7.9 million (2021: €4.0 million) due to higher interest rates within notional 
cash pools. Arcadis utilizes notional cash pools, in which debit and credit balances both attract interest 
income and interest expense.
Finance expense, including the interest expense on leases, increased to €27.7 million due to higher gross 
debt, higher interest rates within notional cash pools, offset by lower other interest expenses. The interest 
expense on loans and borrowings of €13.6 million (2021: €10.8 million) was higher than last year due to 
higher average gross debt to finance the acquisition of IBI Group and DPS Group, and higher interest rates 
on floating interest rate loans (such as several Schuldschein loans).
The carrying amount of the financing transaction fees, taken into account in the valuation of the underlying 
loans and borrowings, at 31 December 2022 amounts to €4.4 million (2021: €3.3 million) on the balance 
sheet. The increase in this amount relates to the transaction fees related to the attracted bridge loan 
financing for the acquisitions of IBI Group and DPS Group. The amortized cost booked in 2022 amounts to 
€0.8 million (2021: €0.5 million) and is booked under Other interest expense. The interest on lease liabilities 
of €7.3 million (2021: €6.6 million) is based on the Incremental Borrowing Rate, see note 16.

12 Income taxes
Income taxes comprise current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognized in profit or loss, except to the extent that the 
tax arises from items recognized in other comprehensive income, directly in equity or from a business combination.
When the Group considers it probable that tax authorities accept a tax treatment it will be treated as such in the 
income tax filings. When it is not considered probable that a tax treatment is accepted, the Group uses the most likely 
amount or the expected value of the tax treatment 
Current tax
Current tax is the expected tax payable on taxable income for the year and adjustments to tax payable related to 
previous years. It is measured using the tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. The difference 
between income tax recognized in profit or loss and income tax paid in the cash flow statement differs primarily due to 
deferred tax recognized on temporary differences and payment of income tax occurring after the reporting date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognized using the balance sheet method and it is not recognized for:
• the initial recognition of goodwill;
• the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss; and
• investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Measurement of deferred tax is based upon tax rates enacted or substantially enacted expected to be applied in the 
years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. Deferred taxes are not discounted.
A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent 
that it is probable that future profits will be available against which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized.

In 2022, the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the option to deduct research and development 
expenditures immediately in the year incurred and requires taxpayers to amortize such expenditures over five 
years for tax purposes. This provision resulted in a current tax payable per the end of 2022 of approximately 
€47 million and a net deferred tax asset increase of €47 million. This provision is also expected to increase our 
2023 current tax payable with a comparable amount, depending on among others the amount of research 
and development expenses in 2023. While the largest impact of this provision is expected to be in 2022, the 
impact will continue over the five-year amortization period, but will decrease over time and is expected to be 
immaterial in year six.
At 31 December 2022, the corporate income tax receivable amounted to €17.8 million (2021: €27.1 million) 
and the corporate income tax liability amounted to €63.5 million (2021: €19.1 million). During 2022, the 
Group paid corporate income taxes for a total amount of €70.4 million (2021: €66.7 million).

The effective corporate income tax rate (income taxes divided by profit before income tax, mainly excluding 
total result from investments) is 31.3% (2021: excluding total result from investments and total result from 
ALEN: 25.1%). For further information related to ALEN, refer to Note 17 in 2021 Annual Integrated Report. 
For 2022 the effective tax rate was impacted by non-deductible loss on divestments of €30.1 million. 
Excluding this loss, but including the total result from investments the effective tax rate is 27.0%.
The effective tax rate differs from the corporate income tax rate in the Netherlands, primarily due to the net 
negative impact of non-deductible items and statutory tax rates in jurisdictions in which we operate that are 
different than the Dutch statutory income tax rate. The net negative impact was partially offset by changes 
in de-recognition of deferred tax assets, prior year adjustments and other.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set of current 
tax against current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to the same taxation 
authoritity and the same taxable entity.
At 31 December 2022, the gross amount of net operating losses, amounting to €88.4 million (2021: €38.0

The majority of the above-mentioned deferred tax assets relate to tax jurisdictions in which Arcadis has 
suffered a tax loss in the current of a preceding period. Significant judgement is required in determining 
whether deferred tax assets are realizable. Arcadis determines this on the basis of expected taxable profits 
arising from the reversal of recognized deferred tax liabilities and on the basis of budgets, cash flow forecasts 
and impairment models. Where utilization is not considered probable, deferred tax assets are not recognized.
At 31 December 2022, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed 
earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized was €164.4 million (2021: 
€139.2 million). No liability has been recognized in respect of these differences because the Group is in a 
position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences, and it is probable that such 
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
13 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to the equity holders of the Company by 
the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the 
Company and held as treasury shares (i.e. shares purchased to cover share/option plans). 
Diluted earnings per share is calculated based on the basic earnings per share and using the weighted average number 
of shares and options outstanding during the period as far as these have a potential dilutive effect, i.e. when the 
exercise price of these options is lower than the share price. The average number of potentially diluted shares is based 
on the average share price in the period on the Euronext Amsterdam Stock Exchange and the options that were in the 
money.
For calculating the earnings per share, the following numbers of average shares are used:
Number of shares 2022 2021
 Average number of issued shares 90,422,091  90,661,792 
 Average number of treasury shares (1,072,627)  (1,278,473)
 Total average number of ordinary outstanding shares 89,369,464  89,383,319 
 Average number of potentially dilutive shares 62,296  393,156 
Total average number of diluted shares 89,431,760 89,776,475 
Of the outstanding options at 31 December 2022, a number of 40,702 options were in the money and 
exercisable (2021: 104,046). Exercising options may lead to dilution. To avoid dilution as much as possible, 
Arcadis repurchases its own shares, which are reissued at the moment options are exercised.

14 Intangible assets and goodwill
Goodwill
Goodwill arises from business combinations and represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the 
Company’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired 
company. Goodwill in respect of equity accounted investees is included in the carrying amount of the investment. 
Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Other intangible assets 
Other intangible assets mainly consist of customer relationships, trade names and expected profits in the backlog of 
acquired companies at the acquisition date. Measurement of Other intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
involves the use of estimates for determining the fair value at acquisition date. This mainly relates to expected profits in 
the backlog of the acquired companies, the customer lists at the acquisition date and the trade name value. The fair 
value is based on discounted cash flows expected to be received from these identifiable intangible assets. 
Subsequently, the assets are amortized over the estimated useful life. The amortization is recognized in profit or loss on 
a straight-line basis, except for the backlog which is calculated based on the expected pattern of consumption of future 
economic benefits embodied in the backlog. The amortization methods and useful lives, as well as residual values, are 
reassessed annually.
Software
Software is measured at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses. Software has a finite life and is 
amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. The amortization methods and useful lives, as well as 
residual values, are reassessed annually. Subsequent costs are recognized in the carrying amount of Software only 
when it increases the future economic benefits. All other expenditures are recognized in profit or loss as incurred.
Configuration and customization costs relating to cloud computing arrangements, whereby the Company does not 
obtain an intangible asset, are expensed when incurred. In such case, prepaid licenses are recognized as prepaid 
expenses (as part of Other current assets) and testing, training and data conversion costs are recognized as Personnel 
costs and/or Other operational costs as incurred.   
Estimated useful lives 
The estimated useful lives of Goodwill and Intangible assets varies according to their respective categories, as shown 
below.

Goodwill
Reflecting the new GBA reporting structure, as of 1 January 2022, the goodwill has been re-allocated 
following ‘IAS 36.87’ applying a two-step approach: first step allocation of 100% of CallisonRTKL goodwill to 
Places (CallisonRTKL is a former operating segment fully integrated into Places), second step allocation of the 
remaining amount to the GBAs based on the relative values.
Consecutive to acquisition of IBI Group by end of September, the fourth CGU Intelligence has been created 
and is composed of Arcadis GEN (initially allocated to Resilience and Mobility equally), IBI Group intelligence 
segment, and Water Platform Company acquired this year. 
IBI Group preliminary goodwill has been allocated across the four GBAs. DPS Group preliminary goodwill has 
been allocated entirely to the CGU Places, and Giftge Consult preliminary goodwill to the CGU Resilience. 
For annual impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to Cash-Generating Units (CGUs). The CGU is the lowest 
level within the Group at which Goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The carrying amount of the goodwill (including provisional goodwill of IBI and DPS) is allocated to each of 
the CGUs as follows:

Impairment testing for cash-generating units containing goodwill
The recoverable amount of Goodwill for impairment testing purpose has been determined based on a value 
in use calculation, which is complex and judgmental. The calculations use cash flow projections based on 
historical performance, our plan for 2023 as approved by the Executive Board and projections for 2023 - 2026, 
after which a terminal value was calculated using an estimated growth rate. 
The key assumptions used in the projections are:
• (Net) revenue growth: based on experience and market analysis;
• EBITDA margin development: based on historical performance, plan 2023 and management’s long-
term projections; and
• Weighted average cost of capital (WACC): based on the market participants view on rates of return 
demanded for investments equivalent to those in the Company. The components of the WACC include 
the Cost of Equity, Cost of Debt and Cost of Lease Liabilities. 
The business plans include management’s estimate about the level and timing of the execution of (the 
improvement of) operating performance and margins. 
The applied assumptions in the test of 2022 are included in the below table, for those CGUs with goodwill as 
at 31 December 2022.

Mobility 5.6% 12.4% -12.6% 10.3% 1.5%
Intelligence 5.6% 14.4% -18.8% 10.4% 1.4%
1 The average net revenue growth represents average for the period from 2024 to 2027.   
The average pre-tax discount rate was 10.9% (2021: 10.4%) and has been determined by iterative 
computation so that the value in use determined using pre-tax cash flows and a pre-tax discount rate equals 
the value in use determined using post-tax cash flows and a post-tax discount rate. The weighted average 
post-tax discount rate used is 8.6% (2021: 7.7%), which includes country specific premiums when applicable.
Observations from impairment testing
The annual impairment test at 31 December 2022 and sensitivity analysis around the key assumptions in that 
test have indicated sufficient headroom for all CGUs and as such a reasonably possible change in any of the 
assumptions would not cause the recoverable amount to be less than the carrying value, except for 
Intelligence. 
The headroom for Intelligence, being the difference between the carrying amount (which includes the 
provisional allocation of goodwill for IBI acquisition) and the recoverable amount is approximately 
€25 million. Management is positive about the medium and long-term perspective of the CGU following 
the expected development of the CGU. If the long-term growth rate used in the value in use calculation 
had been 1% lower than management’s estimates at 31 December 2022, the headroom would amount to 
€8 million. If the long-term EBITDA margin used in the value in use calculation had been 100 bps lower 
than management’s estimates, there would be no headroom. 
If the pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections of this CGU had been 1% higher than 
management’s estimates (11.3% instead of 10.3%), the headroom would amount to €1 million. 
The expected future cash flows used in the goodwill impairment analysis are based on management’s 
estimates. Events in our end-markets as well as the financial markets and the overall economy may have 
an adverse impact on the estimated future cash flows of the Group.

In 2022, the Group has acquired IBI Group and has recognized a backlog for an amount of €40 million for which 
an amortization of €5.8 million has been expensed and presented within ‘amortization other intangible assets’ . 
Other intangible assets have been acquired for which the purchase accounting is provisional (see note 6).

15 Property, plant & equipment
Property, plant & equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Costs include 
expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the assets. 
Subsequent costs are recognized in the carrying amount of Property, plant & equipment if it is probable that future 
economic benefits will be obtained. The costs of day-to-day servicing of property, plant & equipment are expensed as 
incurred.
Depreciation, based on the cost of an asset less its residual value, is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis 
over the estimated useful life. The estimated useful life of Property, plant & equipment vary according to their 
respective categories, as shown in the table hereafter.
Category Years
Land Not depreciated
Buildings 30 - 40 
Furnitures and fixtures 5 - 10 
(IT) equipment 5 - 10 
Property, plant and equipment under development Not depreciated (yet)
Depreciation methods and useful life, as well as residual values, are reassessed annually. When parts of an item of 
Property, plant & equipment have different useful life, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of 
Property, plant & equipment.
Gains on the sale of an item of Property, plant & equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal 
with the carrying amount of Property, plant & equipment and are recognized within Other income in the Consolidated 
income statement. Losses on the sale of an item of Property, plant & equipment are recognized within Other 
operational costs in the Consolidated income statement.
The determination of impairment of Property, plant & equipment involves the use of estimates. The recoverable 
amount is determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows to present value using a discount rate that 
reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. The 
identification of impairment indicators, as well as the estimation of future cash flows, discount rates and the 
determination of the fair value for the assets requires management to make significant judgements.
In 2021 and 2020 no changes were made in the useful lives, depreciation methods and the residual values of 
Property, plant & equipment elements that materially impacted the Company. No properties were registered 
as security for bank loans.

16  Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities
A contract is, or contains, a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in 
exchange for consideration. Control is conveyed when the Group has both the right to direct the identified asset’s use 
and to obtain substantially all the economic benefits from that use. 
Contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Group allocates the consideration to these 
components based on its relative stand-alone prices. Non-lease components are not included in the right-of-use asset 
and lease liability but accounted for separately. 
Right-of-use assets 
At commencement of a lease, the Group measures right-of-use assets initially at cost, and subsequently at cost less any 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.
The cost of the right-of-use assets comprise the following:
• Amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability;
• Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received at or after the 
commencement date;
• Any initial direct costs; and
• Restoration costs i.e estimate of the costs to be incurred for dismantling, removal and/ or restoration to the 
conditions required by the terms of the lease.
See note 29 for the accounting policy on provisions for right-of-use assets (restoration provisions). 
Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a 
straight-line basis.   
Lease liabilities
Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments that are not paid at the 
commencement date discounted using an implicit rate of interest, unless this cannot readily be determined, in which 
case an incremental borrowing rate is used. The lease liability is subsequently increased by the interest cost on the 
lease liability and decreased by lease payments made. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments 
arising from a change in an index or rate, a change in the estimate or the amount expected to be payable under a 
residual value guarantee, or as appropriate, changes in the assessment of whether a purchase or extension option is 
reasonably certain to be exercised or a termination option is reasonably certain not to be exercised.
Judgment is applied to determine the lease term for some lease contracts in which it is a lessee that include renewal 
and termination options. The assessment of whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise such option impacts 
the lease term, which significantly affects the amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets recognized. At reporting 
date all facts and circumstances are considered that create an economic incentive in determining whether it is 
reasonably certain that an extension or termination option will be recognized. Changes in the estimate are recognized 
prospectively.
Incremental Borrowing Rate
The Incremental Borrowing Rate (IBR) is determined based on a build-up approach, whereby each category of leases 
has an IBR based on the country (and currency) of the lessee and the lease term. 
Lease incentives
Lease incentives are deducted from the right of use assets if received before the commencement date of the lease; 
they are deducted from the lease liability if received at or after the commencement date of the lease. 
Amounts received for leasehold improvements are depreciated over a period not longer than the lease term.  
Short-term and low value leases
Payments associated with short-term and/or low value leases are recognized on a straight-line basis as an expense in 
profit or loss. 
As a lessor
The Group sub-leases some of its buildings, although not significant. The head leases are presented in the right-of-use 
assets and the sub-lease contracts are treated as operating leases under IFRS 16. Income from sub-leases is presented 
in Other income, see note 8.
Rent concessions 
Rent concessions are accounted for as lease modifications by the Group.
 
This note provides information for leases where the Group is a lessee.

Leasing activities
The Group’s lease portfolio consists of almost 2,504 active lease contracts at 31 December 2022 (2021: 
2,500), mainly related to real-estate lease contracts and vehicles. Approximately 92% of the value of the lease 
liability is from land and buildings.
Lease terms
Lease terms are generally negotiated locally, with support from the Global Workplace director and/or 
regional real estate or procurement teams where needed. Contracts are negotiated on an individual basis and 
contain a wide range of terms and conditions, such as early termination clauses and renewal rights. They may 
contain both lease and non-lease components, whereby the Group has elected not to include the service 
element in leases (e.g. fuel, insurance) in the right-of-use asset and lease liability.
Termination clauses and renewal rights are included in several real estate leases across the Group. These are 
used to maximize operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the Group’s operations. In 
determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic 
incentive to exercise a renewal right, or not exercise a termination clause. Both extension and termination 
options are however only included in the lease term if it is reasonably certain that a lease will be extended or 
terminated.  
Factors that are considered in terminating or renewing leases include amongst others:
• Significant penalties involved;
• Leasehold improvements made with a significant remaining value; and
• Costs and business disruption required to replace a leased asset.
 
An amount of €19 million (2021: €33 million) extension and/or renewal options are included in the Group’s 
lease liability at 31 December 2022 reflecting that the Group could not replace leased assets without 
significant cost or business disruption.
As at 31 December 2022, potential future cash outflows of €164 million (undiscounted) (2021: €116 million) 
have not been included in the lease liability because it is not reasonably certain that the leases will be 
extended (or not terminated). During 2022 the financial impact of the reassessment of reasonable certainty 
led to a decrease in recognized lease liabilities and right-of-use assets of €5.5 million (2021: €7.3 million).
If the leased asset is abandoned, the depreciation of the Right-of-use asset needs adjustment as of the date 
the lessee makes the decision to abandon the asset, so that as of the cease use date, the carrying amount of 
the Right-of-use asset is zero. Assuming there are no changes in the lease payments, the lease liability will 
remain the same.
 
There were no leases abandoned during the year. Right-of-use assets with a carrying value of €1.8 million 
were abandoned in 2021 and therefore were fully depreciated. The remaining lease liabilities for the 
abandoned leases amount to €0.8 million (2021: €1.6 million).
The Group does not have leases with variable lease payments and does not provide residual value guarantees.
Maturity profile
The undiscounted value of lease commitments as at 31 December 2022 amounts to €339.9 million (2021: 
€277.3 million) and the maturity is as shown in the table below.
Maturity 2022 2021

17 Investments accounted for using the equity method
Joint arrangements
Investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint ventures or joint operations. The classification depends 
on the contractual rights and obligations, rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement.
Joint ventures are joint arrangements in which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net 
assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities. Joint ventures are accounted 
for using the equity method, where interests in joint ventures are initially recognized at cost, including transaction cost. 
Subsequently the Group’s share of the profit or loss and movements in other comprehensive income are included in the 
Consolidated financial statements, whereby the calculation is based on the Group’s accounting policies. When the 
Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in a joint venture, the Group does not recognize 
further losses.
Joint operations are joint arrangements whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to 
the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. Joint operations are accounted for the Group’s 
direct rights to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the joint operations and its share of any jointly held or 
incurred assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These are combined on a line-by-line basis with corresponding items 
in the Group’s financial statements.
Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but no control over financial and operating 
policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds more than 20% of the voting power of the 
entity. Associates are accounted for using the equity method from the date that significant influence commences until 
the date that significant influence ceases. Initially, investments in associates are recognized at cost, including 
transaction cost. Goodwill identified on the acquisition of the associate is included in the carrying amount of the 
investment.
The Consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the net profit or loss and other comprehensive 
income of the associates, after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group. The application of 
the equity method is applied to loans that form part of a Net investment. Loans to associates are carried at amortized 
cost less any expected credit losses. The Group applies the Expected Credit Loss model to loans that form part of the 
Net investment, before recognizing its share of losses from application of the equity method on these loans.
Investments in associates and joint ventures
The nature of business of the Group’s associates and joint ventures are similar. They provide comprehensive 
knowledge-based consultancy, design, engineering and management services in the area of infrastructure, 
water, environment and buildings. The most significant investments in associates and joint ventures are listed 
below.

There are no loans to associates or joint ventures outstanding as at 31 December 2022 (2021: nil). 
The joint ventures have share capital consisting solely of ordinary shares, which are held indirectly by the 
Group, and are non-listed shares. As such there is no available quoted market price for the shares. The Group 
has no contingent liabilities relating to interests in joint ventures at 31 December 2022 (2021: nil).
The €11.8 million result from associates in 2021 was impacted by a favorable outcome of a commercial 
arbitration which resulted to €10.3 million dividend received in 2022.

combination.
 A level 3 valuation was used to determine the fair value. Due to the inherent uncertainty of valuation of 
privately held companies, the fair value may however differ from what would have been used had a readily 
available market existed for all companies.
19 Derivatives
General
The Group uses derivatives in order to hedge the exposure to foreign exchange risks and interest rate risks arising from 
operational, financing and investment activities. Derivatives to be used for hedging purposes can include forward 
foreign exchange rate contracts, foreign exchange swaps and interest rate swaps and a combination of those, such as 
cross-currency interest rate swaps. The Group does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. Hedge accounting 
is applied for cash flow hedges related to forecasted transactions and fair value hedges.
Measurement and recognition
All derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value. Attributable transaction costs are recognized in 
profit or loss when incurred. Subsequently, derivatives are measured at fair value derived from market prices of the 
instruments or valuation techniques, with the fair value changes recognized in profit or loss, unless hedge accounting is 
applied. A gain or loss on remeasurement to the fair value of the interest rate derivatives is recognized in profit or loss 
under fair value change of derivatives. The fair value changes of forward foreign exchange contracts are recognized in 
operating income. The carrying values of the derivatives are recognized in the balance sheet as derivatives, which can 
be classified as current or non-current assets or liabilities, depending on the maturity of the contracts.
Hedge accounting
For a cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction, the transaction should be highly probable to occur and should present 
an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect reported profit or loss. In specific cases hedge 
accounting is applied for cash flow hedges. In that case, the effective part of the fair value change of those derivatives is 
deferred in Other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in Equity. The hedging reserve includes 
the cash flow hedge reserve and the costs of hedging. Changes in the fair value of the currency basis since the inception 
of the hedging relationship will be deferred into a separate component of Other comprehensive income.
The amount recognized in Other comprehensive income as cash flow hedge reserve is released to the related lines in 
profit or loss at the same time as the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss. Any ineffective portion of change in the fair 
value of the derivatives is included in profit or loss immediately.

At inception of the hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item is documented – 
including the risk management objectives, strategy of undertaking the hedge transaction, the hedged risk – and, in case 
of hedge accounting, the methods that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the hedge. Both at the inception of the 
hedge and at each reporting date, the Group makes an assessment whether the derivatives used are highly effective in 
offsetting changes in fair values of the cash flows of the hedged items.
The economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item is, amongst others, determined based 
upon matching notional amounts, a minimal fair value of the hedging instrument at inception, matching the underlying 
hedged risk (interest benchmark rate or currency pair), matching repricing and payment dates and an assessment of the 
likelihood of default of the hedging counterparty. Sources of ineffectiveness can, amongst others, be driven by 
movements in the credit spread of Arcadis and the relevant hedging counterparty, mismatch of payment flow 
frequencies, mismatch of interest conditions, such as interest floors and possible changes to the critical terms of the 
economic relationship.
When a derivative ceases to be highly effective or in case of early redemption of the hedged item, hedge accounting is 
discontinued prospectively. When a cash flow hedge relationship is terminated, the fair value changes deferred in the 
cash flow hedging reserve in equity are released to profit or loss under the fair value change of derivatives only when the 
hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur. Otherwise, these fair value changes will be released to profit or loss at 
the same time as the hedged item.
Fair value
A fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of derivatives is determined by using 
valuation models that incorporate various inputs, such as forward interest rate curves and the credit worthiness of 
counterparties. The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value are consistent with the prior year.
The fair value of derivatives held by the Company as at the balance sheet date is presented in the table below:

Treasury is consulted by entities for alignment of hedge accounting with the Group Treasury policy guidelines 
and assisted with documentation of the hedge relationship, derivatives valuations and effectiveness testing.
As per 31 December 2022, the Group has €40.0 million (notional amount) of fixed-to-floating cross currency 
swaps to manage the currency and interest rate risk of a subsidiary. The market value of these derivatives at 
31 December 2022 was €2.4 million negative (2021: €1.3 million positive) and hedge accounting is applied on 
these derivatives. These fixed-to-floating cross currency swaps mature in October 2023.

During 2022, the Group hedged currency exposures related to transactions in currencies other than the 
functional currency for subsidiaries by way of foreign exchange forward rate contracts in order to minimize 
volatility in the operating income of these subsidiaries due to changes in foreign exchange rates. In addition, 
foreign currency corporate balance sheet positions arising due to foreign currency receivables, payables and 
loan balances were hedged by way of foreign exchange forward rate contracts and foreign exchange swaps. 
Also during 2022, the group specifically hedged the CAD purchase price for the acquisition of IBI Group.

21 Trade receivables
Trade receivables include amounts billed to customers for work performed but not yet paid by the clients, and which 
are expected to be collected within a year after reporting date. Trade receivables are initially measured at fair value, 
which normally represents the consideration the Company expects to receive within the payment term (invoice amount 
excluding costs collected on behalf of third parties, such as sales taxes). Subsequently Trade receivables are measured 
at the consideration expected to be collected.
The Company uses the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model. Trade receivables are reviewed for collectability on a 
case-by-case basis at regular intervals. If a Trade receivable is considered credit impaired (e.g. the customer has failed to 
make a payment when contractually due) the expected loss is determined as the difference between the carrying 
amount and the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the present value of expected future cash flows 
discounted at the effective market interest rates.
A simplified approach is applied that uses a lifetime expected loss allowance to recognize losses for possible 
impairment of Trade receivables that are not individually impaired yet. The Expected Credit Loss is recognized in Other 
operational costs.

Individual assessments, in combination with the fact that the actual write-offs of trade receivables in recent 
years did not cause us to expect that the provision should be significantly higher, resulted in the conclusion 
that the provision for bad debt is sufficient to cover for Trade receivables for which there is objective evidence 
of an impairment.
Provision for Trade receivables
The total provision for Trade receivable includes the Expected Credit Loss for individually non-impaired items 
(stage 1 and 2) and individually credit impaired items (stage 3). To apply the simplified approach to the 
“healthy” portfolio, Arcadis grouped the Trade receivables by country and the days past due. No specific 
measures were taken by the Group to extend credit terms for customers. The expected loss rate for the stage 
1 and 2 losses is based on the country risk and varies from 0.00% to 0.49% for positions less than 90 days 
past due and up to 2.73% for items past due more than 90 days.
The total provision for Trade receivables developed as follows:

22 Contract assets and liabilities
When revenue (cost for contract work performed to date plus recognized profits) exceeds the progress billings, the 
surplus is shown as a Contract asset (unbilled receivables). When progress billings exceed the revenue (cost for contract 
work performed to date plus recognized profits), the balance is shown as a Contract liability (billing in excess of 
revenue). Recognized loss provisions are separately presented as Provision for onerous contracts. Contract assets, 
Contract liabilities and the related Provision for onerous contracts are together generally also referred to as Work in 
progress.
Contract assets are subject to the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model. Arcadis applies a simplified approach that uses a 
lifetime expected loss allowance to recognize losses for possible impairment, in line with the accounting for Expected 
Credit Loss on Trade receivables. The Expected Credit Loss is recognized in Other operational costs.
For further details on the recognition of Contract assets, Contract liabilities and the Provision for onerous contracts see 
the revenue accounting policy in note 6.
The balances of Contract assets and Contract liabilities, as well as the Provision for onerous contracts (see 
also note 29), are as follows:

23 Assets classified as held for sale
In accordance with IFRS 5, non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as ‘held for sale’ when the following 
criteria are met:
• Management is committed to a plan to sell
• The asset is available for immediate sale
• An active program to locate a buyer is initiated
• The sale is highly probable within twelve months of classification as held for sale
• The asset is being actively marketed for sale at a sales price reasonable in relation to its fair value
• Actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that plan will be significantly changed or withdrawn
Immediately prior to classification as held for sale, the assets or groups of assets are measured at carrying value. 
Subsequently, assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are valued at the lower of book value or fair value 
less disposal costs. Assets held for sale are not depreciated.
At 31 December 2022, non-current assets and disposal groups that meet the criteria of Asset held for sale 
amount to nil (2021: €0.1 million).

Prepaid expenses mainly include prepayments of IT service contracts, rent and insurances. The year 2022 was 
impacted by prepayments on multi-year software licenses.
25 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits maturing within three months from the acquisition 
date and used by the Company in managing its short-term commitments. For cash flow reporting purposes bank 
overdrafts are included in Cash and cash equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents at the balance sheet date can be specified as below.

Restricted cash amounting to €29.6 million is composed of cash balances mainly held in China and Middle 
East (2021: €30.4 million). The Group has control over these balances; however, repatriation may be limited 
due to restrictive local regulatory and judicial requirements or high costs involved. As a result, the cash 
balances of some countries cannot be fully included in the global cash pooling or liquidity enhancement 
structures. In line with industry practice, the Company considers cash outside of global cash pooling or 
liquidity enhancement structures to be restricted if the Group is unable to repatriate cash within a defined 
period via either dividends, intercompany loans or settlement of intercompany invoices. 
At 31 December 2022, the cash balance of the captive insurance company named White Rock Insurance 
(Netherlands) Pcc Limited was €19.7 million (2021: €15.6 million).
At 31 December 2022, Cash and cash equivalents and Bank overdrafts have not been offset (2021: nil).  
The bank overdraft at 31 December 2022 of €15.2 million is mainly within DPS Group.

26 Equity attributable to equity holders
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of ordinary shares and 
rights to acquire shares are recognized as a deduction of equity, net of any tax effects.
Priority shares and preference shares are classified as equity since these are non-redeemable, or only redeemable at the 
Company’s option. Dividends on these shares are recognized as distributions within equity.
Repurchase of shares
When share capital is repurchased, the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs net of any tax effects, is 
deducted from equity. Repurchased shares (treasury shares) are presented as a deduction from total equity. When 
treasury shares are sold or reissued, subsequently any amount received is recognized as an increase in equity, and the 
resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is transferred to/from retained earnings.
Dividends
Dividends are recognized as a liability in the period in which they are declared.

Priority shares
Total number of outstanding priority shares at 31 December 2022 is 600 (2021: 600). In 2022, no preferred 
(protective) shares or financing preference shares were issued or outstanding.
The priority shares have been issued since 1987 and are all held by Stichting Prioriteit Arcadis NV; a 
foundation with its corporate seat in Arnhem. Special rights under the Articles of Association of Arcadis NV 
linked to these priority shares concern decision making related to, among others:
• The issuance, acquisition and disposal of shares in the Company;
• Amendments to the Articles of Association;
• The dissolution of the Company and the filing for bankruptcy;
• The entry into or termination of long-term cooperative ventures of substantial significance; and
• Investments (including entering into participations) for an amount equal to at least 25% of the 
shareholders’ equity.
Pursuant to the articles of association of the Priority Foundation, the Board of the Stichting Prioriteit Arcadis NV 
consists of twenty (20) board members (with seven (7) vacancies at 31 December 2022):  seven (7) members of 
Arcadis’ Supervisory Board, two (2) members of Arcadis’ Executive Board, one (1) member of the Executive

Amsterdam, whose board members are appointed by and from the international employees of the Group).
Cumulative Preferred (Protective) Shares
Currently no cumulative preferred (protective) shares have been issued. However, an option agreement to 
acquire such shares has been entered into between Stichting Preferente Aandelen Arcadis NV (the ‘Preferred 
Stock Foundation’) and Arcadis NV under that agreement. The Preferred Stock Foundation has been granted 
the right to acquire protective shares up to a maximum equal to the number of outstanding shares at the 
date in question (call option).
The Board of the Preferred Stock Foundation consists of three (3) members appointed by the Board itself. 
The Chairman (or another member) of the Supervisory Board and the CEO (or the other member of the 
Executive Board) will be invited to attend the board meetings of this foundation. This will not apply if a 
decision is to be made on the exercise of the option right or the exercise of voting rights on acquired shares.
Cumulative financing preferred shares
Since 2002, the Articles of Association of Arcadis NV include the possibility to issue cumulative financing 
preferred shares. Currently, no such shares have been issued.
Agreements with shareholders
The Articles of Association of Stichting Lovinklaan stipulate that their Articles of Association cannot be 
amended without prior approval of Stichting Prioriteit Arcadis NV. In a separate agreement between 
Stichting Prioriteit Arcadis NV and Stichting Lovinklaan it is stipulated that prior approval of Stichting 
Prioriteit Arcadis NV is required for any resolution concerning the disposal or transfer of shares in Arcadis NV 
if, as a result of such resolution the number of shares held by Stichting Lovinklaan will drop below 
12,000,000 (number of shares held at 31 December 2022: 16,444,904). 
Issuance of shares
The General Meeting decides, with the approval of the Supervisory Board and Stichting Prioriteit Arcadis NV, 
about the issuance of shares or grant of rights to acquire shares. The General Meeting can also delegate its 
authority to issue shares, or part thereof, to the Executive Board. As long as any such delegation stands, the 
General Meeting cannot decide to issue. No shares were issued in 2022 (2021: 616,854).
Purchase of shares
As mandated by the General Meeting of Shareholders and with approval from the Supervisory Board 
and Stichting Prioriteit Arcadis NV, the Executive Board may purchase fully paid-up shares in Arcadis NV. 
The mandate is not needed in case the shares are purchased to be transferred to employees and to fulfill 
commitments for stock dividend. As a result of its Long-Term Incentive Plan(s) or related arrangements, 
Arcadis needs to provide shares to persons working for Arcadis. The intention is to minimize dilution by 
purchasing (a portion of) the shares needed for such Long-Term Incentive Plan(s) (or related arrangements), 
as opposed to issuing new shares. 
The following numbers of shares were repurchased over the past five years:
Year

Price at time of 
purchase (in €)
2018  580,958 16.61 to 20.06

2021  2,316,830 27.58 to 40.24
2022  -    - 
The repurchased shares are to cover for the vesting/exercise of shares and options granted and commitment 
for stock dividend. The cash equivalent of the temporary repurchased shares are deducted from Retained 
earnings.
Of the purchased shares, a total number of 563,335 has been placed back in the market through the exercise 
of options in 2022 (2021: 590,501). Net proceeds included in Retained earnings amounted to €1.3 million 
(2021: €6.2 million).
At 31 December 2022, the number of repurchased shares in stock (treasury stock) amounted to 869,517

The profit attributable to the equity holders of the Company over fiscal year 2022 amounts to €135.5 million. 
The Executive Board, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, proposes to deduct an amount of €69.2 
million from the retained earnings and to present for approval to the General Meeting of Shareholders its 
proposal to distribute a dividend amount of €66.3 million, which represents a dividend of €0.74 per ordinary 
share (2021: €0.70). Of the total Retained earnings, an amount of €9.6 million of legal reserves is restricted in 
distribution (2021: €9.6 million). See note 45 to the Company financial statements for further details.

28 Provisions for employee benefits
Most of the pension plans of the Group qualify as defined contribution pension plans. However, the Group also operates 
a few defined benefit pension plans.
Defined contribution pension plans
For defined contribution pension plans, the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity, which are charged to 
profit or loss in the period during which services are provided by employees. The Group’s legal or constructive 
obligation is limited to the contributions paid into the plans. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the 
extent that Arcadis has the unconditional right to cash refunds or reduction in future payments.
Defined benefit pension plans
Some of the pension plans qualify as defined benefit pension plans. For these plans, the costs are recognized as 
personnel costs and financing costs in profit or loss. The amount charged to personnel costs is the cost of accruing 
pension benefits promised to employees over the year, plus the costs of individual events such as past service benefit 
changes, settlements and curtailments (such events are recognized immediately in profit or loss).
The amount charged to financing costs is the net interest expense calculated by applying the liability discount rate to 
the net defined benefit liability or asset. Any differences between the expected interest on assets and the return 
actually achieved, and any changes in the liabilities over the year due to changes in assumptions or experience within 
the plans, are recognized immediately in profit or loss.
The majority of the defined benefit pension plans are funded with plan assets that have been segregated in a trust or 
foundation. These plans are subject to regular actuarial review by external actuaries, using the projected unit credit 
method.
The defined benefit pension plan on the balance sheet comprises the present value of the defined benefit pension 
obligation and the fair value of plan assets. The present value of the obligation is determined by discounting the 
estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds (or suitable alternative where there 
is no active corporate bond market) that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and with 
maturity dates approximating to the terms of the related pension obligations.
Remeasurements arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to 
equity in Other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Past service costs are recognized immediately 
in profit or loss.
The table below provides a summary of the total provision for employee benefits at the balance sheet date.

Defined benefit pension plans
Description of plans
The defined benefit pension plans of the Group are either career average, final salary or hybrid plans. In 
addition, there is a termination indemnity plan for Arcadis Middle East, which pays out a single lump sum at 
exit (regardless of age or reason for exit).
The two main defined benefit pension plans are in the UK, being the ‘EC Harris Group Pension Scheme’ and 
the ‘Acer Group Pension Scheme’ (formerly Hyder), which account for 100% of the pension assets for funded 
schemes in surplus. The defined benefit liability is mainly due to the termination indemnity plan in Arcadis 
Middle East (49% of the total defined benefit liability) and other individually immaterial defined benefit 
pension plans within the Group.
As at 31 December 2022 both defined benefit pension plans in the UK have a surplus of €10.4 million 
(31 December 2021: €26.6 million). This decrease is due to worse than expected investment returns, 
particularly due to financial market turmoil late in 2022, which has been offset to some extent by the 
increase in discount rate placing a lower value on the schemes’ liabilities.
The EC Harris Group Pension Scheme has been closed for future accruals since 31 January 2011, whereas the 
Acer Group Pension Scheme was closed for future accruals since 30 April 2011. Both plans are funded plans. 
The other defined benefit pensions plans are mainly active and funded plans.
There were no defined benefit plans identified for IBI and DPS group during preliminary PPA assessment. 
Governance
The majority of the defined benefit pension plans are established as independent foundations or similar 
entities, with operations governed by local regulations and practice in each country. Boards of Trustees, which 
consist of employer and employee representatives, are generally required to act on behalf of the plan’s 
stakeholders and perform periodic reviews on the solvency of the funds in accordance with local laws and 
regulations. They are responsible for administering the plan assets and for defining the investment strategy.

The investment strategy of the Group in respect of the funded plans is implemented within the framework of 
the various local requirements of the countries where the plans are based. The objective is to control the risks 
and maintain an appropriate balance between the risks and the long-term returns. Therefore, the investments 
are well diversified and managed within the asset-liability matching (ALM) frameworks of the funds. Within 
these frameworks the objective is to match assets to the pensions obligations by investing in long-term fixed 
interest securities with maturities that match the benefit payments as they fall due and in the appropriate 
currency.

Defined benefit liability and employer contributions
The Group has agreed that it will aim to eliminate any pension plan deficit within the next nine years. 
Therefore, funding levels are monitored on an annual basis.
The Company expects €3.3 million in contributions to be paid to the plan in 2023. The estimated net pension 
costs to be recognized in the Consolidated income statement in 2023 amounts to €0.3 million, relating to net 
interest charges. The estimated weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is around 15 years.

Plan assets
There is no local regulation that requires a level of funding of the plan, therefore no assets have been set 
aside to fund these arrangements.
Actuarial assumptions
The principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting date are:
In % 2022 2021
Discount rate 4.60 - 4.75 0.70 - 1.75
Salary increases (expected, per annum) 0 - 2.00 0 - 2.00
As there is no deep market in corporate bonds within the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region and the 
limited number of government bonds available do not provide an adequate reference, the discount rate is 
based on the US AA-rated corporate bond market as a proxy. The payments have an average duration of 
three years, which is lower than in previous years due to the strategic decision made in 2020 to reduce the 
footprint in the Middle East.  
Demographic assumptions for mortality, withdrawal, and retirement are used in determining the liability. 
Because of the nature of the benefit, which is a lump sum payable on exit due to any cause, a combined single 
decrement rate has been used. The retirement age used for the actuarial valuations is as follows:
In years 2022 2021
Male/female Saudi Arabia 60/ 55 60/ 55
Male/female other countries 65/ 65 65/ 65

Deferred salaries
The deferred salaries mainly include a plan for deferred compensation of our operating company in the 
United States. Management of this operating company can elect not to have its salary paid out, but rather 
invested in a fund by the Company, and is offered a choice of three different portfolio types: risk averse, 
neutral and risky. The risk is the responsibility of the participants. The related assets are included in note 20 
for an amount of €9 million (2021: €11 million).
Future jubilee payments
An amount of €3.3 million is recognized for future jubilee payments based on the current agreements in the 
collective labor agreements and the related staff levels (2021: €4.6 million). 
Other
Other deferred compensation includes €5.1 million of long service leave provisions in Australia, where 
employees are entitled to long service leave after a certain number of years of continuous service 
(2021: €5.1 million). The time allowance and conditions of entitlement are set out in legislation and vary 
by territory. An amount of €3.6 million is expected to be paid within one year (2021: €3.8 million).

29 Provisions for other liabilities and charges
Provisions are recognized when there is a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be 
required to settle the obligation. Provisions are measured at net present value, taking into account the timing of the 
cash outflows. The discount rate used reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the liability. Unwinding of the discount is recognized as a finance expense (see note 11).
The amounts recognized as provisions reflect management’s best estimate of the expenditures required to settle the 
present obligations at the balance sheet date or to transfer it to a third party at that time.

Restructuring
Provisions for restructuring include costs related to certain staff compensation and costs directly related to 
the existing plans to execute restructurings, mainly in Middle East, CallisonRTKL and Continental Europe. A 
provision is only recognized once the decision to execute said restructuring has been taken, its costs can be 
reasonably and fairly estimated, and its intended execution has been announced. 
Litigation
Clients of Arcadis sometimes claim, justified or not, that they are not satisfied with the services provided by 
the Company. While the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes 
that, based on (external) advisors and information received, the provision of €31 million (2021: €27.7 million) 
is the best estimate of the potential financial risk, net of insurance coverage. These insurance policies include 
a global professional liability insurance and in addition, local insurance in a number of countries. In general, 
these insurance policies have a self- insured retention and a maximum pay-out level.
Outstanding litigation (including the provisions, defense costs and reimbursement coverage) is reviewed 
periodically and revisions are made when necessary. Since the outcome cannot be predicted with certainty 
and settlement of claims could take several years, final settlement could differ from this best estimate.
For IBI and DPS acquisitions, the Group has conducted a preliminary assessment of the potential contingent 
liabilities and will continue to review these matters during the measurement period. See note 6 for further 
details on business combination disclosures. 
Further information ordinarily required by IAS 37 has not been disclosed on the grounds that it can be 
expected to seriously prejudice the outcome of the disputes.
Restoration provision for leased assets
For lease contracts that require the Company to maintain an underlying asset during the lease term and/or 
restore it to its original condition before returning to the lessor at the end of the lease, a restoration provision 
is recognized when the obligation arises. For the same amount a right-of-use asset is recognized and 
depreciated over the lease term. The discount rate used is the Incremental Borrowing Rate.
Other
The category other provisions include individually immaterial items, and the Company expects that they will 
be substantively used within one to five years.

30 Loans and borrowings 
Interest-bearing debts are measured at amortized cost, in which the difference between the proceeds and repayments 
over time is charged to profit or loss over their duration. The portion of long-term debt that has to be repaid within one 
year after the balance sheet date is presented as the current portion of long-term debt under current liabilities.
All other financial liabilities are recognized on the trade date at which the Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. Non-derivative financial liabilities include loans and borrowings, bank overdrafts, trade 
and other payables. Initially these liabilities are recognized at fair value plus the directly attributable transaction costs. 
Subsequently these financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and that form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are 
included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the statement of cash flows.
Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future cash flows, 
discounted at the Company specific market rate of interest at reporting date.

Long Term loans
Schuldschein loans
In May 2022, €64.0 million of fixed rate Schuldschein loans were repaid in accordance with the contractual 
repayment schedule. 
In October 2022, $9.0 million (€8.6 million) of floating rate Schuldschein loans and $4.0 million (€3.8 million) 
of fixed rate Schuldschein loans were repaid in accordance with the contractual repayment schedule.
At 31 December 2022, the non-current portion of long-term debt includes a total of Schuldschein debt in the 
amount of €133.0 million maturing in 2025 and 2027. The current portion includes €40.0 million and €17.0 
million of Schuldschein loans, from 2015 and 2020, respectively. 
Debt from business combination 
In September 2022, the Group acquired IBI Group and assumed loans for €51.8 million which includes credit 
facilities for €13.8 million and Debentures for €33.4 million. The credit facilities have been repaid after the 
transaction date. 
On 2 October 2020, IBI Group issued 6.5% senior, unsecured Debentures of CAD 46.0 million with a maturity 
date of 31 December 2025. The Debentures are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) under the 
symbol "IBG.DB.E". 
Following the change of control of IBI Group and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 
Debentures, an offer to purchase any and all outstanding Debentures, in whole or in part in cash, at a price

the holders. Consequently, an amount of €10.2 million has been repaid. On or after 31 December 2023, but 
prior to 31 December 2024, the 6.5% Debentures are redeemable, in whole or in part from time to time at the 
option of the Group at a price equal to 103.25% of the principal amount of the Debentures redeemed plus 
accrued and unpaid interest. On or after 31 December 31 2024 but prior to the maturity date of  
31 December 2025, the Debentures are redeemable at a price equal to their principal amount plus accrued 
and unpaid interest. On redemption or at maturity on December 31, 2025, the Group will repay the 
debentures in cash. 
At 31 December 2022, the non-current portion of long-term debt includes € 20.1 million of Debentures. 
In December 2022, the Group acquired DPS Group and assumed loans for €9.0 million, including a Term loan 
facility for €4.0 million and Revolving credit facility for €5.0 million. These loans have been fully repaid after 
the transaction date.

Bridge loan facility 
An underwritten bridge loan facility of €750.0 million was arranged in July 2022 for the acquisition of both 
IBI Group and DPS Group. This bridge loan facility was further syndicated out to a wider group of 
international and reputable relationship banks. The bridge loan has a term of 1 year (maturity in 
September 2023) of which Arcadis NV has the irrevocable right to extend twice by six months. The pricing 
is based on EURIBOR, with a margin that increases every 3 months. The bridge loan facility of €750.0 million 
is classified as a long-term debt.
Financing fees associated with arranging the loan facility amounted to € 2.7 million. 
Short Term Credit facilities
The total available short-term credit facilities amount to €379.7 million, which include all uncommitted credit 
facilities, bank guarantee facilities and surety bond lines with financial institutions of which €158.3 million has 
been used as per 31 December 2022 (2021: €329.6 million and €142.1 million respectively). 
The Group has short-term uncommitted credit facilities of €120.0 million with relationship banks and three 
bank guarantee facilities totaling €76.2 million (2021: €100.0 million and €63.7 million, respectively). These 
short-term credit facilities are used for the financing of working capital and general corporate purposes of the 
Group. 
By the end of the year 2022, the total amount of bank guarantees and letters of credit that were outstanding 
under the €76.2 million guarantee facilities amounted to €41.3 million (2021: €42.1 million). Additionally, 
there were other outstanding bank guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds amounting to €107.1 
million (2021: €99.2 million).
Interest rates
The interest rate ranges for the total loans and borrowings are as follows:
In € thousands 2022 2021

Weighted average interest rate 1 2.8% 1.9%
1 On interest-bearing debt (including the interest effect of swaps)
The increase in the bucket of 3-7% is caused by Schuldschein loans with floating interest and IBI debentures.
Financial covenants
The leverage covenant for the €750.0 million bridge loan, the Schuldschein loans and the €500.0 million 
syndicated Revolving Credit Facility and all the remaining Schuldschein loans prescribes that the average net 
debt to EBITDA ratio is not to exceed the maximum of 3.5, which is confirmed to the Lenders twice a year. 
This leverage covenant is aligned to IFRS 16. At 31 December 2022 the average net debt to EBITDA ratio 
calculated in accordance with the credit documentation of the Schuldschein loans and the €500.0 million 
syndicated Revolving Credit facility is 1.6. No other financial covenants exist for these credit facilities. 
All outstanding Schuldschein loans and the syndicated Revolving Credit Facility do not longer contain an 
interest coverage ratio.

Other current liabilities are non-derivative financial liabilities, which are initially recognized at fair value plus directly 
attributable transaction costs. Subsequently these financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the 
effective interest method.

Of the total accounts payable approximately 35% is subject to a so-called ‘paid-when-paid’ clause (2021: 
45%). The expectation is that all accounts payable will be paid within the normal course of business and are 
therefore classified as short-term liabilities. Further information about Arcadis’ exposure to liquidity risk is 
included in note 32. 
 
Other liabilities include various accrued liabilities, such as to be paid occupancy costs, insurance costs and 
interest costs. Any lease incentives (‘tenant improvement allowances’) received are part of the right-of-use 
asset, see note 16.
32 Capital and financial risk management
Arcadis’ activities expose the Group to a variety of financial risks, including (A) credit risks, (B) liquidity risks, 
and (C) market risks.
These risks are inherent to the way the Group operates as a multinational with locally operating subsidiaries. 
The Executive Board is responsible for the design and functioning of the internal risk management systems. 
The day-to-day risk management activities related to the financial risk management are carried out by 
Arcadis Group Treasury, in line with the guiding principles of the Group Treasury Policy, as updated and 
approved by the Executive Board in May 2021.
Arcadis Audit and Risk Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group risk 
management policies and procedures, and the Arcadis control framework. It also reviews the adequacy of the 
risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
(A) Credit risks
Credit risk arises from receivables from customers as well as cash balances and fair values of derivatives with 
financial counterparties (e.g. banks). The credit risk on customers is influenced mainly by the individual 
characteristics of each customer. Arcadis usually invoices clients for services according to the progress of the 
work. If clients refuse or are unable to meet their contractual payment obligations, the Group may not have 
sufficient cash to satisfy its liabilities and its growth and continued operations could be adversely impacted.
The key objective of the Group’s counterparty risk management is to minimize the risk of losses as a result of 
failure of an individual financial counterparty that could negatively impact the Group’s results. Arcadis aims to 
centralize cash balances with banks that have also provided committed credit facilities to the Group in order 
to reduce this counterparty risk.
The exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis at local entity and at group level. Normally, 
Arcadis only deals with counterparties that have a sufficiently strong credit rating. Where possible, Arcadis 
uses credit ratings provided by external credit rating agencies, thus monitoring creditworthiness in order to 
manage the related credit risk. Furthermore, Arcadis strongly focuses on clients by strengthening the 
commercial relationship and being more selective to which clients services are offered. Through systematic 
account management we aim to build long-term relationships with selected multinational and key national/
local clients. We already have a relationship with the majority of our multinational clients for more than five

Trade receivables
Trade receivables are presented net of a provision for expected credit losses. The credit risk is measured and 
analyzed on a local level at regular intervals, taking into consideration, amongst others, the financial situation 
of the debtor and ageing of receivables. Expected losses are determined in line with IFRS 9, see note 21.
The ageing of Trade receivables and the provision for Trade receivables at reporting date is disclosed below 
and in note 21. The ageing of receivables has led to the recognition of (expected) credit losses and calibration 
of assumptions as included in the Goodwill impairment test.
The movement schedule for the provision for Trade receivables is included in note 21.

There are various reasons for delays in payments that result in past due amounts and that impact Days Sales 
Outstanding (DSO). Arcadis has overdue receivables which are generally considered collectible and for which 
the risk of impairment is remote. 
Amounts due at 31 December 2022 subject to the ‘paid-when-paid principle’ are disclosed in note 21. 
Further details on how Arcadis uses this principle to manage working capital is disclosed in the section 
on liquidity risk.
Other receivables and non-current assets
Other receivables and Other non-current assets are monitored for expected credit losses. They do not 
contain impaired assets and are not past due.
Loans to associates and joint ventures
Loans to associates and joint ventures are subject to credit risk. At 31 December 2022, no material loans to 
associates were outstanding.
Cash and cash equivalents
The credit risk of Cash and cash equivalents is the risk that counterparties are not able to repay amounts owed 
to Arcadis upon request of Arcadis. The objective of the Group is to minimize credit risk exposure in Cash and 
cash equivalents by investing in liquid securities and entering into transactions involving derivative financial 
instruments only with counterparties that have sound credit ratings, a good reputation and belong to the

group of Core banks which also provide committed credit facilities. The related risk is monitored on an ongoing 
basis both at local entity and group level. The Group keeps approximately 66% (2021: 85%) of its cash reserves 
at our Core banks and is only allowed to invest in short-term, liquid securities with counterparties that have an 
investment grade rating from Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s or Fitch. Management monitors these ratings and 
does not expect any such counterparty to fail to meet its obligations in the short-term. The change in 
percentage of Core banks compared to last year is mainly caused by the acquisition of IBI Group and DPS 
Group that are using other banks than our own Core banks.
Guarantees and letters of credit
On behalf of the Group and local entities, financial institutions (such as banks and insurance companies) have 
provided bank guarantees, surety bonds and letters of credit amounting to €151.6 million outstanding as at 
31 December 2022 (2021: €141.3 million). In addition, Arcadis NV has provided financial guarantees to banks 
for a maximum amount of €177.6 million (2021: €163.0 million). No Expected Credit Losses are recognized 
from these guarantees.
(B) Liquidity risks 
Liquidity risk is the risk that Arcadis will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The 
primary objective of liquidity management is providing for sufficient committed credit facilities and cash and 
cash equivalents to enable Arcadis to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, 
without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to Arcadis. Our Group Treasury Policy supports this 
principle by stating that the Group aims to have no more than 33% of total fixed debt to be refinanced in any 
one year and that the minimal liquidity at any given point in time should always exceed €200.0 million.
Neither the aged (un)billed receivables of individual customers, nor the profile of the accounts receivable 
portfolio, impose a significant threat to the Group’s liquidity planning.
Over the course of the year, fluctuations occur in the working capital needed to finance operations. The Group 
strives to have a good liquidity position at all times, strictly controlling working capital by optimizing billing 
and collection and consequently maintaining a healthy net debt to EBITDA ratio.
To manage working capital, but only if legally allowed and commercially possible, Arcadis agrees with part of 
its sub-contractors so-called ‘paid-when-paid’ clauses. This means that Arcadis is in such instances better able 
to match the cash inflows from debtors with the related cash outflows to suppliers, as the timing of the 
payment of the supplier is dependent on the collection of the receivable from a client. This could however 
be impacted by contractual clauses and/or local laws and regulations that limit the maximum extension of 
payment terms to a moment before Arcadis gets paid by its client. In case of non-payment by the debtor, 
Arcadis still has to fulfil its obligations towards the supplier under a ‘paid-when-paid’ clause. Accounts payable 
at 31 December 2022 subject to the ‘paid-when-paid principle’ are disclosed in note 30. The expectation is that 
all accounts payable will be paid within the normal course of business and are therefore classified as short-
term liabilities.

(C) Market risks 
Market risk includes currency risk (C1) and interest rate risk (C2) and comprises the risk that changes in 
market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect Arcadis’ income or the value of its 
holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market 
risk exposures within acceptable parameters set by the Group Treasury policy.
(C1) Currency risk 
The key objective of the Group foreign exchange transaction exposure management is aimed at the active 
management of foreign exchange exposures by Group Treasury to reduce and limit the adverse effects of 
exchange rate changes on the Group’s profitability.
Trade and financing transactions in non-functional currencies 
The subsidiaries of Arcadis mainly operate in local markets, and as such both sales invoices and purchase 
invoices are mainly denominated in local currencies. In some instances, however, invoices are in the functional 
currency of the counterparty, which results in a currency exposure for the subsidiary. The exposure to foreign 
exchange risk on sales and costs denominated in another currency than the respective functional currencies 
of the subsidiaries is very limited. Only in limited cases, e.g., for material transactions, the subsidiaries of 
Arcadis enter into forward foreign exchange contracts with Group Treasury in order to hedge these 
transaction risks.
Borrowings are denominated in currencies that partly match the cash flows generated by the underlying 
operations of the Group, primarily Euro and US dollar.
Arcadis group companies can have positions in foreign currencies which are different than their respective 
functional currencies. For the main currencies the following positions per currency (translated in euros) are 
the cumulative gross exposures of non-functional currencies of all Arcadis group companies combined.

Foreign currency sensitivity analyses are performed by applying an expected possible volatility of a currency, 
assuming all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. All monetary assets and liabilities of

All material balance sheet positions have been hedged with foreign exchange contracts. The translation risk 
relating to subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the Group reporting currency of Euro are not 
hedged, in accordance with the Group Treasury policy.
(C2) Interest rate risks
The Group manages interest rate risks by financing fixed assets and part of current assets with shareholders’ 
equity and long-term debt. The remainder of current assets is financed with short-term debt including 
revolving bank debt with variable interest rates. Based on the interest risk profile, financial instruments were 
outstanding during the year to cover part of the interest rate risk on long-term borrowings. This risk is 
applicable to long-term debt, short-term debt and bank overdrafts in the Consolidated balance sheet 
amounting to €970.2 million at year-end 2022 (2021: €263.7 million). The increase of €706.5 million is mainly 
the result of the €750.0 million bridge loan facility received for the acquisition of IBI Group and DPS Group.
The Group has €40.0 million of fixed to floating cross currency swaps to manage currency risk and interest 
rate risk in accordance with the Group Treasury Policy.
The Group Treasury Policy states that the fixed portion of net debt should be at least 40% to protect against 
increases in interest rates as well as providing some certainty on expectations for interest expense in profit or 
loss. As of December 2022, this fixed portion of 40% is not the case as a result of the floating interest rate 
bridge loan facility. This topic will be addressed when the refinancing process is arranged in 2023.
Sensitivity analysis Interest rate risk
Interest rate sensitivity analyses are performed by applying an expected possible volatility of interest rates, 
assuming all other variables remain constant. All interest-bearing liabilities of the Group at year-end are 
revalued, which results in a hypothetical impact on the pre-tax profit for the year and equity as summarized 
below.

Capital risk management 
Arcadis’ objectives when managing capital are to safeguard Arcadis’ ability to continue as a going concern in 
order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal 
capital structure that optimizes its cost of capital and allows for sufficient flexibility towards the execution of 
Arcadis’ strategy.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to its risk appetite. The Group manages the capital 
structure and makes adjustments to it based on changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics 
of the underlying assets. The capital structure can be altered by adjusting the amount of dividends paid to 
shareholders, return capital to shareholders, or issue new debt or shares. From time to time, Arcadis 
purchases its own shares, which are used as volume hedges for the transfer of shares under Arcadis’ long-
term incentive plans and to off-set the dilutive effect of scrip dividends.
Consistent with the financial covenants agreed with the banks, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the 
average Net debt to EBITDA ratio. This ratio is calculated as the average interest- bearing debt minus cash 
and cash equivalents divided by EBITDA. EBITDA is calculated as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation 
and amortization. 
To obtain access to the debt capital markets, the Group obtained an investment grade credit rating of BBB- 
(Stable outlook) from Standard & Poor’s. The Group and its subsidiaries are not subject to external capital 
requirements, other than financial covenants under the credit documentation of its committed credit 
facilities, as disclosed in the notes to these financial statements.

During 2022, Arcadis’ strategic goal on financing, which was unchanged from 2021, was to maintain a  
Net debt to EBITDA ratio between 1.5x and 2.5x (IFRS 16 based) in order to secure access to finance at a 
reasonable cost. 
Financial covenants
The financial covenant set under the contracts of the committed credit facilities that are applicable to Arcadis 
includes a Total Leverage ratio. The Total Leverage ratio for the €500.0 million Revolving Credit Facility and all 
the Schuldschein loans has a maximum of 3.5x, which is based on IFRS 16. These ratios are included in the 
next tables.

The ratio as disclosed above is calculated based on the definitions as agreed with and aligned between the 
different providers of committed credit facilities. The calculation of the average Net debt to EBITDA ratio is 
based on the average net debt of Q2 and Q4. Throughout 2022, Arcadis complied with all financial and non-
financial covenants.
Going concern assumption
Management has assessed the going concern assumption and exercised significant judgment in making 
reasonable estimates. Based on the latest available financial (cash flow) forecasts and sensitivity analysis 
performed, management concluded that there is no material uncertainty related to events and conditions 
that may cast significant doubt on the Group ability to continue as a going concern.

Fair value hierarchy
The financial instruments carried at fair value are analyzed by valuation method, using the following levels: 
• Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
• Level 3: inputs for the assets or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable 
inputs).
All financial instruments carried at fair value within the Group are categorized in Level 2, except for the 
other investment in Techstars and the deferred consideration whereby a Level 3 valuation has been used 
(see note 18). 
The fair value of foreign exchange forward rate contracts is based on quoted market prices at the balance 
sheet date, being the present value of the quoted forward price. Those quotes are tested for reasonableness 
by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the term and maturity of the contract, using market 
interest rates.

Consolidated financial statements
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated by discounting estimated future cash flows based on 
the terms and maturity of each contract and using market interest rates for a similar instrument at 
measurement date. These calculations are tested for reasonableness by comparing them with bank 
valuations.
 
The fair value of loans and receivables is based on the present value of future principal and interest cash 
flows, discounted at the Group specific market rate of interest at reporting date. For financial leases the 
market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements.
The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, 
discounted at the market rate of interest at reporting date. Due to the short-term character of the 
receivables, the fair value equals the carrying value.
33 Commitments and contingent liabilities
Committed lease payments for short-term and/or low-value leases are reported as off-balance sheet commitment. The 
lease payments (excluding costs for services such as insurance and maintenance, which are expenses as incurred) are 
recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis unless another systemic basis is representative of the time pattern of 
the user’s benefit, even if the payments are not on that basis. 
Non-financial guarantees are accounted for as a contingent liability until such time it becomes probable that the 
Company will be required to make a payment under such guarantee. Financial guarantees are subject to the Expected 
Credit Loss model, and a credit loss is recognized for the expected cash shortfalls. 
Contingent liabilities are potential obligations of sufficient uncertainty that it does not qualify for recognition as a 
provision (see note 29), unless it is assumed in a business combination (see note 6). Contingent liabilities are reviewed 
periodically to assess whether an outflow of resources will become probable.

Leases
The Group’s lease arrangements mainly relate to contracts for leased cars, building and other (IT) equipment. 
These leases have varying terms, termination clauses and renewal rights. For leased assets the Group has 
recognized right-of-use assets and lease liabilities as at 31 December 2022, except for short-term and/or low-
value leases. The lease expense recognized in profit or loss of 2022 relating to short-term and/or low-value 
leases amounted to €1.5 million (2021: €0.7 million).
 
See note 16 for further information on leases.  
Guarantees 
Arcadis has issued corporate guarantees as security for credit facilities, bank guarantee facilities and surety 
bond lines. Guarantees or guarantee-like items issued by a financial intermediary (such as bank guarantees 
and surety bonds) can be issued in relation to projects, advances received, tender bonds or lease 
commitments to avoid cash deposits. Bank guarantees or surety bonds issued for project performance can be 
claimed by clients where Arcadis fails to deliver in line with the agreed contract. In such cases, the liability of 
the bank should be no greater than the original liability on Arcadis. Where the failure to perform arose due to 
an error or omission by Arcadis, the claim could be covered by the professional indemnity insurance cover.

guarantees and surety bonds posed an immaterial and insignificant risk to Arcadis.
On 31 December 2022, only a part of the local bank guarantee facilities and local debt facilities have been used.
Other commitments
The other commitments amount to €1.0 million (2021: €8.4 million) and include the service part of a long-
term global IT service contract, which runs for a remaining period of one to two years.
Contingent liabilities
Litigation
The Company is involved in various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings as a result of its normal 
course of business, either as plaintiff or defendant. Management ensures that these cases are firmly 
defended. In some of these proceedings, claimants allegedly claim amounts for project contract breaches 
that are significant to the Consolidated financial statements.
All legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are assessed on a regular basis. In consultation with in-house 
and external legal counsels, management regularly evaluates facts and circumstances of those claims and, 
based on the analysis of possible outcomes of litigation and settlements, provisions are accrued for. 
Provisions are accrued for only where management believes it is probable that Arcadis will be held liable, 
the amount is reasonably estimable, and the claim has not been insured. These provisions are reviewed 
periodically and adjusted if necessary, to the extent that cash outflow of related proceedings is probable, 
including defense costs and reimbursements by our insurance policies.
Since the ultimate disposition of asserted claims and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, final 
settlement can differ from this estimate and could require revisions to the estimated provision, which could 
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s balance sheet, profit or loss, and cash flows for a particular 
period.
Tax
Arcadis operates in a high number of jurisdictions and is subject to a variety of taxes per jurisdiction. Tax 
legislation can be highly complex and subject to changes and interpretation. Therefore, Arcadis is exposed to 
varying degrees of uncertainty and significant judgement is required in determining the global tax position. 
The Company accounts for its income taxes on the basis of its own internal analyses supported by external 
advice. The Company continually monitors its global tax position including changes in tax laws or 
interpretations of such laws. Whenever uncertain tax positions arise, the Company assesses the potential 
consequences and recognizes liabilities depending on the strength of the Company’s position and the 
resulting risk of loss.

Notes to the Company financial statements
36 General
Unless stated otherwise, all amounts are rounded in thousands of euros. The Company financial 
statements have been prepared using the option of article 2:362 of the Dutch Civil Code, meaning that 
the accounting principles used are the same as for the Consolidated financial statements. Foreign 
currency amounts have been translated, assets and liabilities have been valued, and net income has been 
determined, in accordance with the principles of valuation and determination of income presented in note 
2 of the Consolidated financial statements.
In the Company financial statements, subsidiaries of Arcadis NV are accounted for using the equity 
method. To achieve optimal transparency between the Consolidated financial statements and the 
Company financial statements name conventions are aligned.
37 Corporate charges to subsidiaries
Corporate charges to subsidiaries include items such as headquarter support service fees, royalty fees, 
and license fees. It includes ‘true-ups’ for the previous year, which have been calculated and settled in 
2022 following the final 2021 results. The significant increase in the Corporate charges are attributable to 
the change in operational model to the GBAs.

resulted in higher recharges from operating companies that employed GBA resources.
39 Net finance expense

exchange differences on financial liabilities and interest on leases are part of the finance expenses.

As Arcadis NV applies the same valuation principles in the Company financial statements as those applied 
in the Consolidated financial statements, IFRS 9 is also applicable to intercompany loans and receivables. 
The assessment of the Expected Credit Loss did not result in a material impact on the Company financial 
statements. To have consistency between the Consolidated and standalone equity no loss has been 
recorded, which is in line with the clarification as provided by the Raad voor de Jaarverslaggeving (RJ) 
that a reversal of the Expected Credit Loss can be included in the carrying amount of the loans. 
The increase in loans issued is mainly related to the newly acquired subsidiaries in 2022. 
Noted is that Arcadis NV has control, directly or indirectly, over all the subsidiaries it granted loans and 
can convert these into equity if needed.
The exchange rate differences mainly relate to loans in US Dollar, British Pound Sterling and 
Canadian Dollar.

The Receivables from subsidiaries and associates mainly relate to short-term financing by means of 
current accounts. 
Arcadis applied the simplified approach under IFRS 9 to its intercompany current receivables and 
concluded that the Expected Credit Loss is immaterial. See note 21 of the Consolidated financial 
statements for further details on the simplified approach and note 44 on the treatment of the Expected 
Credit Loss on intercompany positions in the Company financial statements.
The Other receivables include €9.7 million (2021: €10.5 million) of prepaid amounts, mainly related to 
software licenses and other prepaid IT support.

Our audit approach
We designed our audit procedures with respect to the key audit matters, fraud and going concern, and the 
matters resulting from that, in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in 
forming our opinion thereon. The information in support of our opinion, such as our findings and 
observations related to individual key audit matters, the audit approach fraud risk and the audit approach 
going concern was addressed in this context, and we do not provide a separate opinion or conclusion on 
these matters.
Overview and context
Arcadis N.V. is a design & consultancy firm for natural and built assets. The Group is comprised of several 
components and therefore, we considered our group audit scope and approach as set out in the section 
‘The scope of our group audit’ . We paid specific attention to the areas of focus driven by the operations of 
the Group, as set out below.
The change of the operating model to a Global Business Area structure, the completion of a number of 
acquisitions and a number of divestments of non-strategic countries or activities in the last four months 
of the year characterised the financial year 2022. This affected the segment reporting (including goodwill 
re-allocation), disclosures on business combinations and the scope of our audit as described in the 
sections ‘The scope of our group audit’ and ‘Key audit matters’ .
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement 
in the financial statements. In particular, we considered where the executive board made important 
judgements, for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions 
and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. In these considerations, we paid attention to, 
amongst others, the assumptions underlying the physical and transition risk related to climate change.
In note 2 of the financial statements, the Company describes the areas of judgement in applying 
accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty. Given the significant estimation 
uncertainty and the related higher inherent risks of material misstatement in relation to the re-allocation 
and valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets as well as accounting for business combinations 
(including the provisional purchase price allocation), as well as project revenue recognition and valuation 
of contract assets, we considered these matters as key audit matters as set out in the section ‘Key audit 
matters’ of this report. 
Arcadis N.V. assessed the possible effects of climate change and its plans to meet the net zero 
commitments on its financial position, refer to paragraph ‘Sustainable solutions’ (including the paragraph 
‘Arcadis EU taxonomy disclosure’ in the executive board report, the ‘Arcadis TCFD disclosure’ and ‘Arcadis 
TCFD assessment’) in the additional information. We discussed Arcadis N.V. ’s assessment and governance 
thereof with the executive board and evaluated the potential impact on the financial position including 
underlying assumptions and estimates. 
We used our sustainability specialists, who are also involved in the assurance engagement over selected 
financial and non-financial indicators in the Annual integrated Report, with respect to the sustainability 
information included in the other information (including the EU taxonomy disclosure). The expected 
effect of climate change is not considered to be a separate key audit matter.
We ensured that the audit teams at both group and component level included the appropriate skills and 
competences which are needed for the audit of a global client in the design & consultancy industry. We 
therefore included experts and specialists in the areas of, amongst others IT, share-based payments, 
income tax, valuations, sustainability and actuaries in our team.

The outline of our audit approach was as follows:
Materiality
Audit scope
Key audit 
matters
Materiality
• Overall materiality: €15 million
Audit scope
• We conducted audit work on eight components and 
performed speciﬁed procedures on one compo -
nent. For the acquisitions of the IBI and DPS groups 
we conducted an audit of speciﬁc account balances 
on the date of acquisition and on the 31 December 
2022 balances.
• Virtual and in person meetings were held with all 
components in scope. 
• Audit coverage: 71% of consolidated revenue, 
79% of consolidated total assets and 73% of 
consolidated proﬁt before tax.
Key audit matters
• Accounting for the acquisition of the IBI and DPS  
Groups.
• Impact of change in operating model to Global 
Business Areas on segment reporting, goodwill 
re-allocation and valuation of goodwill.
• Project revenue recognition and valuation of 
contract assets.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by the application of materiality, which is further explained in the 
section ‘Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements’ .
Based on our professional judgement we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, 
including the overall materiality for the financial statements as a whole as set out in the table below. 
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the nature, timing and extent of 
our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and to evaluate the 
effect of identified misstatements, both individually and in aggregate, on the financial statements as a 
whole and on our opinion. 
Overall group materiality €15 million (2021: €12 million).
Basis for determining materiality We used our professional judgement to determine overall materiality. As a basis for our 
judgement, we used 0.5% of net revenue.
Rationale for benchmark applied We used net revenue as the primary benchmark, a generally accepted auditing practice, 
based on our analysis of the common information needs of the users of the financial 
statements. On this basis, we believe that net revenue is an important metric for the 
financial performance of the Company. 
Component materiality Based on our judgement, we allocate materiality to each component in our audit scope 
that is less than our overall group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across 
components was between €1.6 million and €10.8 million. Certain components were 
audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group 
materiality.
We also take misstatements and/or possible misstatements into account that, in our judgement, are 
material for qualitative reasons.
We agreed with the supervisory board that we would report to them any misstatement identified during 
our audit above €600,000 (2021: €500,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, 
warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

The scope of our group audit
Arcadis N.V. is the parent company of a group of entities. The financial information of this group is 
included in the consolidated financial statements of Arcadis N.V.
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we, in aggregate, provide sufficient coverage of the 
financial statements for us to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking 
into account the management structure of the Group, the nature of operations of its components, the 
accounting processes and controls, and the markets in which the components of the Group operate. In 
establishing the overall group audit strategy and plan, we determined the type of work required to be 
performed at component level by the group engagement team and by each component auditor.
Our audit primarily focussed on the significant components of the Group: the Netherlands, United 
Kingdom and United States. We subjected three components to audits of their complete financial 
information, as those components are individually financially significant to the Group. Following the 
acquisitions of the IBI Group (late September 2022) and the DPS Group (late November 2022), we 
instructed local component auditors to conduct an audit of certain financial statement line items in the 
opening balance sheets as well as on the 31 December 2022 balance sheets. The audit procedures mainly 
focused on project related balances and cash and bank. One component was subject to specific risk-
focused audit procedures as this component includes higher risk areas.
In total, in performing these procedures, we achieved the following coverage on the financial line items:
Revenue 71%
Total assets 79%
Profit before tax 73%
None of the remaining components represented more than 4% of total group revenue or total group 
assets. For those remaining components we performed, among other things, analytical procedures to 
corroborate our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatements within those 
components.
The group engagement team performed the audit work on the financial information of the Company. For 
the other components we used component auditors who are familiar with the local laws and regulations 
to perform the audit work.
Where component auditors performed the work, we determined the level of involvement we needed to 
have in their work to be able to conclude whether we had obtained sufficient and appropriate audit 
evidence as a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole.
We issued instructions to the component audit teams in our audit scope. These instructions included, 
amongst others, our risk analysis, materiality and the scope of the work. We explained to the component 
audit teams the structure of the Group, the main developments that were relevant for the component 
auditors, the risks identified, the materiality levels to be applied and our global audit approach. We had 
individual calls with each of the in-scope component audit teams both during the year and upon 
conclusion of their work. During these calls, we discussed the significant accounting and audit issues 
identified by the component auditors, their reports, the findings of their procedures and other matters 
that could be of relevance for the consolidated financial statements. The group engagement team met 
with all component teams and a representation of local management virtually or in person including the 
IBI and DPS Group. For each of these locations we reviewed selected working papers of the respective 
component auditors. The group engagement team performed the audit work on the group consolidation, 
financial statement disclosures and a number of more complex items at head office. These included 
segment information, re-allocation and valuation of goodwill, accounting for business combinations, 
taxation, accounting for derivative financial instruments and share-based payments.
By performing the procedures outlined above at the components, combined with additional procedures 
exercised at group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence on the 
Group’s financial information, to provide a basis for our opinion on the financial statements.

Audit approach fraud risks
We identified and assessed the risks of material misstatements of the financial statements due to fraud. 
During our audit we obtained an understanding of the entity and its environment and the components of 
the internal control system. This included the executive board’s risk assessment process, the executive 
board’s process for responding to the risks of fraud and monitoring the internal control system and how 
the supervisory board exercised oversight, as well as the outcomes. We refer to section Enterprise risk 
management of the executive board report for executive board’s fraud risk assessment. 
We evaluated the design and relevant aspects of the internal control system and in particular the fraud 
risk assessment, as well as the code of conduct, whistle-blower procedures and incident registration. We 
discussed the fraud risk assessment with Arcadis’ risk management and compliance officer. We evaluated 
the design and the implementation and, where considered appropriate, tested the operating effectiveness 
of internal controls designed to mitigate fraud risks.
We asked members of the executive and supervisory board as well as the internal audit department, legal 
affairs, compliance department, human resources, and regional directors and the supervisory board 
whether they are aware of any actual or suspected fraud. This did not result in signals of actual or 
suspected fraud that may lead to a material misstatement. 
As part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we, in close co-operation with our forensic specialists, 
evaluated fraud risk factors with respect to financial reporting fraud, misappropriation of assets and 
bribery and corruption. We evaluated whether these factors indicate that a risk of material misstatement 
due to fraud is present.
We identified the following fraud risks and performed the following specific procedures:
Fraud risk identified Our audit work and observations
Risk of management override of controls
Management is in a unique position to perpetrate fraud because of management’s ability to manipulate accounting records and 
prepare fraudulent financial statements by overriding controls that otherwise appear to be operating effectively.
 
We paid attention to the risk of management override of controls, including risks of potential misstatements due to fraud based on 
an analysis of potential interests of management including the incentive to meet certain targets. Considering this analysis, we paid 
specific attention to the judgement applied in re-allocation and valuation of goodwill and the estimate of the cost to complete project 
revenue contracts. 
To the extent relevant to our audit, we evaluated the design of the internal control environment that reduces the risk of breach 
of internal control. Also, we paid specific attention to user access management in the IT system and performed compensating 
procedures when necessary. 
We selected journal entries based on risk criteria and performed audit procedures to validate these entries.
We also performed specific audit procedures regarding important estimates of management, including the accounting for the 
business combinations, re-allocation and valuation of goodwill and the cost to complete  project revenue contracts as described the 
key audit matters below. In our assessment of estimates, we paid specific attention to the inherent risk of bias from management with 
regard to estimates. Refer to the Key Audit Matters in this report for more information on how we addressed this risk. 
Our audit procedures did not lead to specific indications of fraud or suspicions of fraud with respect to management override of 
controls.
Risk of fraud in revenue recognition 
As part of our risk assessment and based on a presumption that there are risks of fraud in revenue recognition, we evaluated which 
types of revenue transactions or assertions give rise to the risk of fraud in revenue recognition. 
Arcadis enters into contracts that are considered complex from a revenue recognition perspective. We focussed on those contracts 
which include a fixed price element. The nature of those contracts requires management to estimate the cost to complete, that 
impacts the revenue recognised. 
Estimates are inherently uncertain and might be subject to management bias. There might be incentives for management to use 
estimates in order to satisfy stakeholders, reach KPIs outlined in compensation plans and-/or to meet debt covenants.
Where relevant to our audit, we assessed the design of the internal control measures related to revenue reporting and in the 
processes for generating and processing journal entries related to the revenue.
We used a primarily substantive testing-based approach with respect to the cost to complete. Reference is made to the Key Audit 
Matter ‘Project revenue recognition and valuation of contract assets’ for the audit procedures we performed. 
Our audit procedures did not lead to specific indications of fraud or suspicions of fraud with respect revenue recognition.

Independent auditor’s report
We incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit. We also considered the outcome of our other 
audit procedures and evaluated whether any findings were indicative of fraud or non-compliance of laws 
and regulations. Whenever we identified any indications of fraud, we re-evaluated our fraud risk 
assessment and its impact on our audit procedures.
Audit approach going concern 
As disclosed in section ‘Going-concern assumption’ in note 32 in the financial statements, the executive 
board performed their assessment of the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern for at least twelve 
months from the date of preparation of the financial statements and has not identified events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern 
(hereafter: going-concern risks). Our procedures to evaluate the executive board’s going-concern 
assessment included, amongst others:
• Considering whether the executive board’s going-concern assessment includes all relevant information 
of which we are aware as a result of our audit and inquiring with the executive board regarding the 
executive board’s most important assumptions underlying its going-concern assessment; 
• Evaluating the executive board’s current budget including cash flows for at least twelve months from 
the date of preparation of the financial statements taking into account all relevant information of which 
we are aware as a result of our audit;
•  Analysing whether the (bridge) financing obtained for the acquisitions has been secured with a 
maturity to enable the continuation of the entirety of the entity’s operations, including the assessment 
of the irrevocability of the extension rights, the refinancing possibilities, the related classification as 
long-term as well as compliance with relevant covenants; 
• Analysing the financial position per balance sheet date; and
• Performing inquiries of the executive and supervisory board as to its knowledge of going-concern risks 
beyond the period of the executive board’s assessment. 
We concluded that the executive board’s use of the going-concern basis of accounting is appropriate, and 
based on the audit evidence obtained, that no material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions 
that may cast significant doubt on the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the 
audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the supervisory board. 
The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters identified by our audit and that 
we discussed. In this section, we described the key audit matters and included a summary of the audit 
procedures we performed on those matters.

Key audit matter Our audit work and observations
Accounting for the acquisition of the IBI and DPS Groups
Refer to note 6 of the financial statements
During 2022 the Group acquired the  IBI Group for a total consideration of €573 million and the DPS Group for a total consideration of 
€229 million. The acquisitions have been accounted for as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3 and requires a number of 
significant and complex judgements in the determination of the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired. 
A key element of the valuation and purchase price allocation was to assess the fair value of the backlog in IBI Group (amounting to 
€40 million). 
The purchase price allocation is reported as provisional for both acquisitions as a number of aspects (such as identification and 
valuation of other intangible assets, consideration of uncertain tax positions and legal claims and lease option extensions) will be 
finalised in 2023. 
The accounting for these acquisitions is a key audit matter in the audit due to the substantial effect on total assets and liabilities and 
due to the significance of the related disclosures. 
We understood and evaluated the process of the business combinations, reviewed the sale and purchase agreements and checked 
the acquisition dates and purchase price considerations paid. 
We involved our valuation specialists to assist us in evaluating management’s and management’s experts work (including their 
competence) related to the provisional purchase price allocation and in particular the valuation of the backlog for the IBI Group
We instructed PwC Canada and EY Ireland to perform an audit on specific financial statement line items on the opening balance 
sheets and the 31 December 2022 balance sheets. 
We evaluated whether the disclosures are in accordance with the relevant accounting standards and sufficiently disclose the 
provisional status of the purchase price allocation. 
Our procedures did not result in material findings with respect to the valuation and disclosures in relation to the business 
combinations. 
Impact on segment reporting, goodwill re-allocation and valuation of goodwill following Arcadis changed operating model 
Refer to notes 5 and 14 of the financial statements
 
Arcadis has changed its operating model to a Global Business Area (‘GBA’) structure from 1 January 2022. 
The reportable segments are aligned with the new operating model of the Group, effective from 1 January 2022, as the Company has 
fully organised itself into three GBAs. 
Mirroring the new GBA reporting structure, as of 1 January 2022, management has re-allocated the goodwill applying a two-step 
approach: firstly, the allocation of entities which are fully integrated into one segment and secondly, the allocation of the remaining 
amount to the GBAs based on the relative values. 
Subsequent to the acquisition of IBI Group by end of September, a fourth GBA (‘Intelligence’) has been created and is composed of 
Arcadis GEN (initially allocated to Resilience and Mobility), IBI Group intelligence activities, and Water Platform Company acquired in 
2022. DPS Group’s preliminary goodwill has been allocated entirely to the GBA Places. 
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually together with other assets of the respective cash generating units at the level on which 
they are monitored, being the four GBAs: Mobility, Places, Resilience and Intelligence. 
We focused on this area given the magnitude of the goodwill balance and because the executive board’s assessment of the ‘value in 
use’ of the group’s four GBAs is subject to significant estimation uncertainty. This involves significant judgement to assess future cash 
flows, which are driven by revenue growth, operating EBITDA margin, working capital developments and the discount rates applied to 
discount these future cash flows. 
Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements includes the segment reporting and Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements 
discloses the key assumptions applied by management for goodwill impairment testing. 
The change in the operating model has a significant impact on the segment disclosures and the goodwill impairment testing 
(including assessment of the re-allocation of goodwill) which is subject to significant estimation uncertainty and requires significant 
judgement. This is therefore determined to be a key audit matter. 
We assessed the new GBA structure, including determination and reporting lines to the Chief Operating Decision Maker following the 
change in the operating model as of 1 January 2022 and after the establishment of the fourth GBA Intelligence. We assessed that the 
goodwill is monitored at the level of the GBAs by amongst others obtaining management’s reporting pack, organisational structure 
and review of board meeting minutes. Our valuation experts supported us in the assessment of the re-allocation of the goodwill. 
On the annual goodwill impairment test, our audit procedures mainly included an assessment of assumptions applied in the 
impairment model, testing of the inputs to the model, assessing the disclosure note on goodwill, testing the mathematical accuracy 
of the model and a reconciliation of the model to the five-year forecasts and long-term strategic plans that were approved by senior 
management. 
We have challenged the assumptions applied by management. This was done by, amongst others, testing the expected margin 
increase, by comparing the margin and revenue growth to the historic performance of the company, assessing the expected revenue 
growth by reviewing available market data for the industry outlook and development of the book-to-bill ratio. 
Our valuation experts supported us in the evaluation of the methodology and model in accordance with IAS 36, the evaluation of the 
discount rate as well as other assumptions and methodologies used.
 
Further, we gained an understanding of management strategic plans to assess the revenue and EBITDA growth rate in the explicit 
forecasting period in combination with the assessment of the terminal growth rate used for impairment testing.
We also have analysed the sensitivity of the ‘value in use’ to changes in the respective assumptions in relation to the available 
headroom. We assessed the adequacy of the disclosures relating to goodwill in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36. 
Our procedures did not result in material findings with respect to the re-allocation and valuation of goodwill and the related 
disclosures.

Report on the other information included in the annual integrated report
The annual integrated report contains other information. This includes all information in the annual 
integrated report in addition to the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Based on the procedures performed as set out below, we conclude that the other information:
• I s consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements; and
• Contains all the information regarding the executive board report and the other information that is 
required by Part 9 of Book 2 and regarding the remuneration report required by the sections 2:135b 
and 2:145 subsection 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. 
We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and the understanding obtained in our audit 
of the financial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the other information contains 
material misstatements.
By performing our procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 and section 2:135b 
subsection 7 of the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of such procedures was 
substantially less than the scope of those procedures performed in our audit of the financial statements.
The executive board is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including the executive 
board report and the other information in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. The 
executive board and the supervisory board are responsible for ensuring that the remuneration report is 
drawn up and published in accordance with sections 2:135b and 2:145 subsection 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
Key audit matter Our audit work and observations
Project revenue recognition and valuation of contract assets
Refer to notes 7, 21, and 22 of the financial statements
We consider this a key audit matter since project revenue recognition and the valuation of contract assets are significant to the 
financial statements based on materiality and because of the degree of management judgement involved.
Management applies judgement to determine the cost to complete for contracts, which is the basis for revenue recognition and 
contract asset valuation, as well as for assessing provisions for onerous contracts. 
In addition, the valuation of contract assets requires significant management judgement in determining recoverability, especially in 
the Middle East region, considering the above average ageing and the magnitude of the contract assets. 
 
We assessed the nature of the Group’s revenue contracts. We performed substantive audit procedures on individually significant 
projects as well as high-risk projects. In addition, we took a sample over the remaining population to ensure sufficient coverage over 
all projects. 
These substantive procedures focused on the key assumptions applied by Arcadis to determine the cost to complete. The procedures 
included obtaining evidence to support applied hourly rates, challenging the number of expected hours to complete the project and 
reconciling changes in budgets to supporting evidence such as contract modifications. We also discussed the progress of the projects 
with the respective project managers and management of the operating companies. In these audit procedures, we were alert to 
management bias. 
With regard to the above average ageing, magnitude of the contract assets in the Middle East region, and the in prior years 
announced decision to reduce Arcadis’ footprint in the Middle East region, specific attention has been given to the collection of 
trade receivables and valuation of several contracts with significant contract assets. We have discussed management’s position 
papers for these projects with the responsible project managers, the contract solutions team and the local CFO and CEO. We have 
obtained supporting documentation, which included support for contract modifications, correspondence with the client and minutes 
confirming the status of negotiations with the client.
We assessed the adequacy of the disclosures relating to revenue recognition, in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 15. 
Our procedures did not result in material findings with respect to revenue recognition and the related disclosures.

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements and ESEF
Our appointment
We were appointed as auditors of Arcadis N.V. on 13 May 2015 by the supervisory board. This followed the 
passing of a resolution by the shareholders at the annual general meeting held on 13 May 2015. Our 
appointment has been renewed annually by shareholders and now represents a total period of 
uninterrupted engagement of eight years.
European Single Electronic Format (ESEF)
Arcadis N.V. has prepared the annual integrated report in ESEF. The requirements for this format are set 
out in the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 with regard to regulatory technical standards on the 
specification of a single electronic reporting format (these requirements are hereinafter referred to as: 
the RTS on ESEF).
In our opinion, the annual integrated report prepared in XHTML format, including the partially marked-up 
consolidated financial statements, as included in the reporting package by Arcadis N.V., complies, in all 
material respects, with the RTS on ESEF.
The executive board is responsible for preparing the annual integrated report, including the financial 
statements, in accordance with the RTS on ESEF, whereby the executive board combines the various 
components into a single reporting package. Our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance for our 
opinion on whether the annual integrated report in this reporting package complies with the RTS on ESEF.
We performed our examination in accordance with Dutch law, including Dutch Standard 3950N 
‘Assuranceopdrachten inzake het voldoen aan de criteria voor het opstellen van een digitaal 
verantwoordingsdocument’ (assurance engagements relating to compliance with criteria for digital 
reporting).
Our examination included amongst others:
• Obtaining an understanding of the entity’s financial reporting process, including the preparation of the 
reporting package.
•  Identifying and assessing the risks that the annual integrated report does not comply in all material 
respects with the RTS on ESEF and designing and performing further assurance procedures responsive 
to those risks to provide a basis for our opinion, including:
• Obtaining the reporting package and performing validations to determine whether the reporting 
package, containing the Inline XBRL instance document and the XBRL extension taxonomy files, has 
been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the technical specifications as included in 
the RTS on ESEF.
• Examining the information related to the consolidated financial statements in the reporting package 
to determine whether all required mark-ups have been applied and whether these are in accordance 
with the RTS on ESEF.
No prohibited non-audit services
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we have not provided prohibited non-audit services as referred to 
in article 5(1) of the European Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-
interest entities.
Services rendered
The services, in addition to the audit, that we have provided to the Company or its controlled entities, for 
the period to which our statutory audit relates, are disclosed in note 56 to the financial statements.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the executive board and the supervisory board for the financial statements
The executive board is responsible for:
• The preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with EU-IFRS and Part 
9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code; and for
• Such internal control as the executive board determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the 
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
As part of the preparation of the financial statements, the executive board is responsible for assessing the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting frameworks 
mentioned, the executive board should prepare the financial statements using the going-concern basis of 
accounting unless the executive board either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations or 
has no realistic alternative but to do so. The executive board should disclose in the financial statements 
any event and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our responsibility is to plan and perform an audit engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain 
sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for our opinion. Our objectives are to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high but not absolute level of assurance, which makes it possible that we may 
not detect all material misstatements. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.
Materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect 
of identified misstatements on our opinion.
A more detailed description of our responsibilities is set out in the appendix to our report.

Appendix to our auditor’s report on the financial statements 2022 of Arcadis N.V.
 
In addition to what is included in our auditor’s report, we have further set out in this appendix our 
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements and explained what an audit involves.
The auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism throughout the 
audit in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence 
requirements. Our audit consisted, among other things of the following:
• Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit 
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a 
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the intentional override of internal control.
•  Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.
•  Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates and related disclosures made by the executive board.
•  Concluding on the appropriateness of the executive board’s use of the going-concern basis of accounting, 
and based on the audit evidence obtained, concluding whether a material uncertainty exists related to 
events and/or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, 
to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our 
auditor’s report and are made in the context of our opinion on the financial statements as a whole. 
However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
•  Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
Considering our ultimate responsibility for the opinion on the consolidated financial statements, we are 
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. In this context, we have 
determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures for components of the Group to ensure that we 
performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole. Determining 
factors are the geographic structure of the Group, the significance and/or risk profile of group entities or 
activities, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates. On this 
basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review of financial information or specific balances 
was considered necessary.
We communicate with the supervisory board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit. In this respect, we also issue an additional report to the audit committee 
in accordance with article 11 of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of 
public-interest entities. The information included in this additional report is consistent with our audit 
opinion in this auditor’s report.
We provide the supervisory board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters 
that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related actions taken 
to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.
From the matters communicated with the supervisory board, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key 
audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public 
disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, not communicating the matter is in 
the public interest.

Limited assurance report of the independent auditor
To: the executive board and the supervisory board of Arcadis N.V.  
Assurance report on the selected financial and non-financial indicators  
in the Annual Integrated Report 2022 
Our conclusion
Based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that 
causes us to believe that the selected financial and non-financial indicators marked with symbol  in the 
Annual Integrated Report 2022 of Arcadis N.V. are not prepared in all material respects, in accordance 
with Arcadis N.V. ’s reporting criteria.
What we have examined
The object of our assurance engagement concerns the selected financial and non-financial indicators 
marked with symbol  included in section ‘2022 at a glance’ in the Annual Integrated Report 2022 of 
Arcadis N.V. (hereafter: the indicators). We have examined the selected financial and non-financial 
indicators marked with symbol  in the Annual Integrated Report 2022 of Arcadis N.V. The indicators 
examined are as follows:
1. Employee engagement (employee net promoter score, scale -100 to +100)
2. Voluntary turnover rate (as% of permanent employees)
3. Number of appointed privacy officers under the privacy policies
4. Women in total workforce (as % of permanent and temporary employees)
5. Arcadis’ carbon footprint (MT CO2 per FTE)
6. Number of identified environmental non-compliances
7. Investigated AGBP alleged breaches (assessed and, as needed, investigated)
8. Employees passing Code of Conduct training (as % of total employees)
9. Lost Time Case Frequency (LTCF, per 200,000 work hours)
10. Total Recordable Case Frequency (TRCF, per 200,000 work hours)
11. Financial indicators which include:
a. Net revenues (in € millions)
b.  Net Income from Operations (in € millions) and per share (in €)
c.  Dividend per share (proposed, in €)
d.  Operating EBITA margin (as % of net revenues)
e.  Net Working Capital (as % of gross revenues)
f. Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)
g.  Return on Net Working Capital
h.  Net debt to EBITDA ratio (average)
i.  Free cash flow (in € millions)

The basis for our conclusion
We conducted our examination in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standard 3000A 
Assurance engagements, other than audits or reviews of historical financial information (attestation-
engagements). This engagement is aimed to provide limited assurance. Our responsibilities under this 
standard are further described in the section ‘Our responsibilities for the examination’ of our report.
We believe that the assurance information we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our conclusion.
Independence and quality control
We are independent of Arcadis N.V. in accordance with the ‘Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van 
accountants bij assurance opdrachten’ (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with 
respect to independence) and other relevant independence requirements in the Netherlands. 
Furthermore, we have complied with the ‘Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants’ (VGBA, 
Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to rules of professional conduct).
We apply the ‘Nadere voorschriften kwaliteitssystemen’ (NVKS, Regulations for quality systems) and 
accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and 
procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and other applicable 
legal and regulatory requirements.
Applicable criteria
The reporting criteria used for the preparation of the indicators are Arcadis N.V. ’s reporting criteria, as 
disclosed in section ‘Glossary non-financial & financial indicators’ of the Annual Integrated Report 2022. 
The absence of an established practice on which to draw, to evaluate and measure non-financial 
information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques and can affect comparability 
between entities, and over time.
Consequently, the indicators need to be read and understood together with the reporting criteria used.
Responsibilities for the indicators and the examination thereof
Responsibilities of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board  
The executive board of Arcadis N.V. is responsible for the preparation of the indicators in accordance with 
Arcadis N.V. ’s reporting criteria, including selecting the reporting criteria, the identification of the 
intended users and the criteria being applicable for the purpose of these users.
Furthermore, the executive board is responsible for such internal control as it determines is necessary to 
enable the preparation of the indicators that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error.
The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the company’s reporting process on the indicators.
Our responsibilities for the examination
Our responsibility is to plan and perform our examination in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient 
and appropriate evidence to provide a basis for our conclusion.
Our conclusion aims to provide limited assurance. The procedures performed in this context consisted 
primarily of making inquiries with officers of the entity and determining the plausibility of the information 
included in the indicators. The level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is 
substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance 
engagement been performed.

Procedures performed
We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism throughout the 
examination in accordance with the Dutch Standard 3000A, ethical requirements and independence 
requirements.
Our examination consisted, among other things, of the following:
• Evaluating the appropriateness of the reporting criteria used, their consistent application and related 
disclosures in the indicators. This includes the evaluation of the reasonableness of estimates made by the 
executive board.
• Through inquiries, obtaining a general understanding of the control environment, processes and 
information relevant to the preparation of the indicators, but not for the purpose to obtain assurance 
evidence about their implementation or to test their operating effectiveness.
• Identifying areas of the indicators with a higher risk of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error. Designing and performing further assurance procedures aimed at determining the plausibility of the 
indicators responsive to this risk analysis. Those other procedures consisted amongst others of:
• Interviewing management (and/or relevant staff) at corporate level responsible for the sustainability 
strategy, policy and results.
• Interviewing relevant staff responsible for providing the information for, carrying out internal control 
procedures on, and consolidating the data in the indicators.
•  Determining the nature and extent of the review procedures for the group components. For this, the 
nature, extent and/or risk profile of these components are decisive. Our procedures were performed out 
of head office. 
• Obtaining assurance evidence that the indicators reconcile with underlying records of the company.
• Reviewing, on a limited test basis, relevant internal and external documentation.
• Performing an analytical review of the data and trends of the indicators submitted for consolidation at 
corporate level.
• Reconciling the financial indicators with the financial statements.
• Evaluating the consistency of the indicators with the information in the Annual Integrated Report 2022, 
which is not included in the scope of our review.
• To consider whether the indicators as a whole, including the disclosures, reflect the purpose of the 
reporting criteria used.
We communicate with the executive board and supervisory board regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the review and significant findings that we identify during our review.

Governance
Arcadis is committed to good governance across its business, based on integrity, transparency, 
accountability, and proper supervision. To successfully manage climate-related risks and opportunities 
we have governance mechanisms in place across the business.
The Supervisory Board supervises and advises the Executive Board (EB) in the performance of its 
management tasks and supervises the overall development of the Company and its affiliates.
The Supervisory Board has four committees: an Audit and Risk Committee (the AARC), a Selection 
Committee, a Remuneration Committee and a Sustainability Committee (the SusCo). Each composed 
of Board members, their task is to assist and advise the Supervisory Board in fulfilling its responsibilities. 
For more information see the Corporate Governance section of this report.
The AARC, comprised of four Supervisor Board members, is responsible for reviewing and managing risks 
across the business.
The SusCo assist and advise the Supervisory Board in sustainability, including on risk and opportunities. 
The SusCo meets at least four times a year. More information on the SusCo can be found in our 
Governance website.
The EB is entrusted with the management of the Company, under supervision of the Supervisory Board. 
The Executive Board consists of the CEO and the CFO. The EB is responsible for the management of the 
Company as well as the continuity of the Company and the Company’s goals, objectives, long-term value 
creation strategy, policy, and results. It has oversight on and annually approves and adjusts our risk 
universe, including sustainability and climate-related risks. The SB is informed quarterly of our climate-
related risks.
 
Climate-related issues are managed under the guidance of the EB and the Executive Leadership Team 
(ELT). ELT members hold ownership of mitigating identified key risks and pursuing identified 
opportunities. The ELT is led by our CEO, who has final responsibility for ownership of company 
performance, including climate-related topics.
The following are also in place to support the EB and ELT and ensure strong governance at every level 
throughout the business:
• Non-Financial Reporting Steering Committee, meeting at least four times a year, consists of one 
member of the EB, one member of the ELT, the Chief Sustainability Officer, the Global Accounting 
Director and the Non-Financial Reporting Director. The NFR SteerCo role is to provide strategic 
direction as plans and objectives are developed;
• Chief Sustainability Officer, leading the implementation of our Sustainability strategy and ambition.
In addition to its internal carbon reduction and climate change efforts, Arcadis contributes to external 
programs aimed at helping the transition to a net zero world. This includes contributions to working 
groups of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the International 
Federation of Consulting Engineers (FIDIC). In addition to contributions to TCFD work for WBCSD, 
Arcadis also contributes to new developments such as those by the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial 
Disclosures (TNFD).
Strategy
Arcadis has embedded its approach to climate change within its overall business strategy, which is 
detailed in the strategy Section of this Annual Integrated Report.
During 2020 we redefined our business strategy for 2021-2023, as part of our 3-year strategy cycle. 
In our strategy sustainability and climate change are placed at the heart of everything we do.
Our overarching sustainability ambition is to accelerate the transition to a net zero world in a way that 
improves quality of life.
During 2022 we upgraded our environmental management system to e enhance implementation of our 
net zero ambition. For our clients projects we invested in expanding our core services and solutions that 
drive sustainable client outcomes.

Arcadis updates its strategy based on identified risks, currently risk is monitored on the following 
timescales:
Impact Time Horizon From To Duration
Short-term 2022 2025 0-3 years
Medium-term 2026 2030 3-8 years
Long-term 2031 2050 10-30 years
Arcadis Global Sustainability strategy defines our steps to accelerate the transition to a net zero world 
and includes climate related risks and opportunities.
To reflect our new ambition and to leverage the global scale of our expertise, we evolved our global 
operations by:
• Consolidating into Global Business Areas. For clients, this change will optimize access to our global 
skills, capabilities and experience, allowing for the delivery of best-in- class (sustainable) solutions, 
as well as efficient service and product delivery;
• Developing new client services and solutions that generate sustainable client outcomes, including 
the growth of our global Sustainability Advisory Practice;
• Developing our systems to assess and reduce the impact of our operations;
• Educating and engaging with internal stakeholders to inform and upskill our workforce (For more 
information see the Education and Engagement section of this report);
• Ensuring our own sustainable business transformation, working with Global Business Areas and their  
in-country leads to integrate sustainability into their strategy, processes, services, and solutions.
From a 2019 baseline, Arcadis is committed to reducing Scope 3 business travel emissions by 35% and 
domestic and international flights by 50% by 2025. Arcadis has also committed to transition its fleet to 
electric vehicles by 2030.  Further to these short-term targets, Arcadis has set reduction targets that were 
approved in February 2022 by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), see page 81. These targets will 
be used to guide our actions.
Risk management
Arcadis’ Risk & Control (ARC) Framework enables a culture of risk awareness across the organization 
by identifying risks and defining controls which mitigate or manage these risks in line with Arcadis’ risk 
appetite. Our approach helps Arcadis’ leadership identify, evaluate, communicate, and manage risks.
Arcadis has embedded a robust risk management process. For more information refer to the Enterprise 
Risk Management section in this report.
The EB is responsible for maintaining a comprehensive system of risk management and internal control, 
including climate-related risk, and for regularly reviewing its effectiveness. Each year the EB performs a 
review of Arcadis’ risk universe and the Risk and Control Framework and makes adjustments as 
conditions change.
The ARC Framework currently identifies 16 risk categories, with Sustainability identified as one of the risk 
categories, under which climate change falls.
Climate related risk management is embedded in our global Environmental Management System 
Standard. The system ensures that any identified climate-related risks or opportunities are tracked and 
monitored. For example, GHG emissions and energy consumption are tracked through this system.
During 2022, we began a quantitative Climate Scenario Analysis, starting with a detailed review of the 
risks and opportunities climate change poses for the business. The identified physical and transition risks 
from this process were socialized with internal stakeholders and used as a basis for further CSA.
 
Metrics and targets
Arcadis uses a range of KPIs to track progress against climate-related targets. In February 2022, 
SBTi approved Arcadis’ 1.5°C-aligned climate targets, which cover scope 1, market based scope 2, 
and scope 3 (focused on fuel- and energy-related activities, employee business travel, and employee 
commuting) emissions. This target will be a core tool for us to monitor our progress against and develop 
actions around.

Our Executive  Board and leadership teams have climate-related performance linked into their executive 
remunerations. Remunerations linked to climate-performance ensure top-down guidance and focus 
efforts on meeting climate goals. For example, GHG emissions and energy consumption.
We currently have a range of metrics in place to monitor our environmental impacts:
Carbon metrics
Arcadis has an established process for measuring our Scope 1, 2 and 3 carbon emissions. This allows us to 
monitor and track our progress against our targets. We disclose multiple years of emissions data, which 
enables us to track progress. For further detail on Arcadis’ previous energy consumption and GHGs 
emissions disclosure, see the Sustainability section of this report. 
Additional metrics
Arcadis also captures its impacts from all operations, calculated based on the GHG Protocol Corporate 
Standard. Our progress is reflected in several ESG performance benchmarks, including Sustainalytics, , 
CDP, MSCI, ISS and EcoVadis. Key metrics relevant to our identified climate-related risks and opportunities 
identified are summarized in the table below:
Target Deadline Progress Key metric Page
Current 1.5°C Science 
Based Target (-74% 
vs 2019 in scope 1+2; 
and -74% vs 2019 in

2035 In February2022, Arcadis received approval of its 
science-based targets from the SBTi to reduce its 
emissions in line with a 1.5°C climate scenario. Our 
intensity-based targets cover scope 1 and market-
based scope 2 combined, and scope 3 emissions 
separately. In 2022 we conducted a detailed review 
of both the relevance of all scope 3 categories to 
our business and our methodologies for calculating 
relevant categories. As a result of this review, we have 
expanded our inventory to include additional scope 3 
categories to align with leading practice. Due to these 
changes, we plan to resubmit our GHG reduction 
target to SBTi for approval and have started this 
process with SBTi. Considering the current scope of 
this target, we are on track -see more details on the 
reductions of our carbon intensity in the lines below 
in this table.

Arcadis 2022 TCFD assessment
Building on the qualitative scenario analysis performed in 2021, Arcadis engaged its Sustainability Advisory team to perform a qualitative and 
quantitative assessment of the potential impacts on Arcadis from five climate-related transition risks and opportunities under two climate scenarios 
and three time horizons.
In addition, the team evaluated the physical climate risks for Arcadis by analyzing the largest offices of 
Arcadis by number of FTEs (124 offices), the offices of IBI (44) plus 86 of the largest project sites by net 
revenue generated.
The analysis demonstrates that Arcadis’ business model is largely resilient to the effects of climate change 
and that the financial impacts on the operational cost side are limited or positive depending on the 
scenario, given the actions Arcadis is taking to mitigate these impacts. On the revenue side, the 
development of our Sustainability Advisory services offering and the integration of sustainability into the 
activities of all four Global Business Areas makes the opportunities outweigh the risks. This is especially 
driven by demand for both climate mitigation and climate adaptation services. 
Transitional risk & opportunities in more detail
The risks and opportunities were selected earlier in the year in a workshop in which the Risk, Growth, and 
Sustainability teams, Sustainability Advisory, and each of the Global Business Areas participated. Together, 
they identified the following five risks and opportunities:
 
 
Target Deadline Progress
1 Carbon pricing Impacts of carbon pricing policies on 
operating costs
Policy and legal risk
2 Energy cost Impacts of changes of energy prices 
on operating costs
Market risk
3 Shift to lower 
carbon energy 
sources
Avoided costs from meeting our 
climate targets and reducing energy 
consumption 
Resource efficiency
4 Growth drivers Opportunities for revenue growth 
from increase in demand for services 
that support low carbon economy and 
climate resilience
Products and services 
5 Reputational Impacts of our climate actions and 
commitments on relationships with 
clients, investors and shareholders, 
communities, and employees
Reputation
To explore potential transitional risks and opportunities from climate change we used two scenarios 
“Net zero 2050” and “Current Policies” from the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) 
climate scenarios framework.
The net zero 2050 scenario details as follows: 
Low carbon scenarios (1.5°C/ 2°C) - This scenario aligns with the IPCC Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 
(SSP) SSP1-RCP2.6. This scenario was chosen as it aligns with Arcadis’ ambition of aligning to 1.5-degree 
warming and represents the rapid decarbonization that is needed to avoid the worst impacts of climate 
change. This is the scenario where the impacts of transitioning to a low carbon economy are likely to be 
most impactful as governments worldwide commit to driving down emissions. For example: higher 
carbon prices and greater business regulation.

The current policies scenario details: 
High carbon scenarios (‘Business-as-usual’/4°C) - This scenario is aligned with IPCC SSP5-RCP8.5 where 
climate is expected to warm by at least 4°C by 2100. This scenario has been chosen as it is ‘business as 
usual’ with no policy changes and leads to growth in emissions, causing physical effects of climate change 
to be felt with greater severity. This scenario includes physical impacts of climate change that are likely to 
be most impactful, for example: high temperature increases, high rates of sea level rise, and increased 
frequency and intensity of extreme weather events.

Policy & Market | Energy and Carbon Price
Description - Implementation of external carbon-pricing policies – such as taxes on aviation, energy, or 
fuel suppliers to drive the low-carbon transition or elimination of fuel subsidies – could impact Arcadis’ 
expenses. Quantifying risks associated with energy and carbon prices helps Arcadis make informed 
decisions about investments and manage financial and regulatory risks.
Potential financial impacts - Costs from carbon price exposure and shift in energy prices. Outside of 
energy-intensive sectors, economies are not directly exposed to carbon tax or market-based carbon 
prices. This analysis assumes the remit of those markets expands to cover all emitters. Note: energy and 
carbon costs based on 2010 prices, following the NGFS standard methodology. 
Time horizon for significant impact - Medium/Long term 
Analysis scope 
The analysis covers five countries (US, NL, AUS, DE, UK) representing 70% of revenues. Additionally, some 
of these costs are expected to be mitigated if Arcadis meets its emission reduction targets.
Potential impact by scenario
Scenario type Net zero scenario Current policies scenario
Costs from carbon price exposure Where carbon is aggressively taxed, 
Arcadis’ potential increase in costs from 
carbon price exposure could be in the 
range of €3.8 million per annum in 
2030 to €17 million per annum in 2050 
under a net zero scenario, with Scope 3 
(business travel) accounting for most of 
the increase.
Where carbon is not effectively taxed, 
Arcadis’ potential increase in costs from 
carbon price exposure could peak in 
2030 at €138,000per annum in 2030, 
falling to €111,000 in 2050 under a 
current policies scenario. 
Costs from shift in energy (electricity 
and gas) prices exposure
Where energy mixes are rapidly 
changed, Arcadis’ potential energy 
costs could reach €4.6 million per 
annum in 2030 and remain high at €4 
million per annum in 2050 under a net 
zero scenario.
Where energy mixes gradually 
decarbonizes, Arcadis’ potential 
increase in costs from energy price 
exposure could be in the range of €3.7 
million per annum and holding steady 
at this level until 2050 under a current 
policies scenario. 
Arcadis’ response 
Arcadis supports the aims of the Paris Agreement and Glasgow accords and has committed to reduce 
Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 74% per full time employee by 2035 from a 2019 base year. Arcadis also 
commits to reduce Scope 3 GHG emissions 74% per full time employee by 2035 from a 2019 base, 
focusing on business travel, fuel & energy related activities, commuting and working from home. 
Additionally, Arcadis committed to increase annual sourcing of renewable electricity from 6.8% in 2019 to 
100% in 2022 and achieved that target.

Energy Source | Shift to Low Carbon Energy Sources
Description - Arcadis has the opportunity to reduce its energy expenses from meeting its net zero targets 
and reducing its energy use. An opportunity also exists in reducing its real estate footprint in post-
pandemic return-to-work, which could also change portfolio efficiency depending on facility leases which 
are terminated or not renewed.
Potential financial impacts - Savings from avoided operational and capital expenses.
Time horizon for significant impact - Medium/Long term 
Potential impact by scenario
Scenario type Net zero scenario Current policies scenario
Fossil fuel exposure risks Potential changes in renewable vs fossil fuel 
prices under this scenario: 
• Potential increase in renewable electricity 
prices in the short to medium term due to 
increase in electricity and renewable energy 
demand to meet electrification needs.
• In the long-term, renewable energy prices 
could continue to decrease with the growth 
in the renewable energy market to meet net 
zero scenarios and expected improvements 
in technologies and battery storage 
solutions.
Reduced exposure to potential future fossil 
fuel price fluctuations.
Stable operational costs (e.g., through use of 
lowest cost abatement) vs. business as 
usual, but higher operating costs vs. net zero 
scenario.
Cost of carbon exposure risk Reducing emissions and energy use 
and shifting to renewables could 
reduce Arcadis’ exposure to potential 
fossil fuel price fluctuations and 
exposure to changes in the cost of 
carbon.
Reduced exposure to GHG emissions and 
therefore less sensitivity to changes in cost 
of carbon.
Costs from shift in energy (electricity 
and gas) prices exposure
If Arcadis reduced its global electricity 
consumption by a quarter by 2050 this could 
translate into estimated operational savings 
of around €1.4 million per annum across the 
five territories under the net zero scenario.
If Arcadis reduced its global electricity 
consumption by a third by 2050 this could 
translate into estimated annual operational 
savings of €1.8 million by this year under the 
current policies scenario.
Arcadis’ response 
Effects here are similar to the energy and carbon price development, so mitigation is the same.  Arcadis 
supports the aims of the Paris Agreement and Glasgow accords and has committed to reduce Scope 1 
and 2 GHG emissions 74% per full time employee by 2035 from a 2019 base year. Arcadis also commits to 
reduce Scope 3 GHG emissions 74% per full time employee by 2035 from a 2019 base, focusing on 
business travel, fuel & energy related activities, commuting and working from home. Additionally, Arcadis 
committed to increase annual sourcing of renewable electricity from 6.8% in 2019 to 100% in 2022 and 
achieved that target.

Risks • Loss of clients based on the work or 
perceived work done with heavy emitting 
sectors, loss of revenue from clients who fail 
or contract as a result of the rapid transition.
• Risk of growing our own services 
appropriately or fast enough to meet clients’ 
needs, allowing existing or new competitors 
to take greater market share. 
• Not having enough resources to deliver 
services to support the transition could lead 
to a loss of market share and reputation and 
inability to sustain business growth.
• Loss of clients and revenue from clients 
who lose economic viability due to 
physical risks. 
• Not having enough resources and trained 
staff to deliver services to support climate

Description - Reputational risks and opportunities related to our climate actions and commitments could 
impact our relationships with clients, investors and shareholders, communities, employees, and our ability 
to attract talent.
Potential financial impacts - Brand risks’ and opportunities’ impacts on revenues. Increased cost to 
attract and retain talent and turnover costs. 
Time horizon with significant impact - Short to long term
Potential impact by scenario
Scenario type Net zero scenario Current policies scenario
Resilience • Our ability to meet our net zero targets 
and contribute to finding solutions and

on our climate the commitments could 
impact our brand and revenue. Every 1% 
increase or reduction in global revenue is 
worth approximately €33.8 million based 
on 2021 revenue.
• Transition speed will not be a challenge 
under this scenario and not lead to 
exposure
Revenue exposure • Brand risks could arise from being 
associated with companies who are 
perceived as not taking appropriate 
climate action or not complying with 
climate disclosure rules.
• Under this scenario no additional pressure 
will develop to exit certain sectors 
Ability to deliver • Delivering sustainability solutions has 
risen as an important topic among our 
employees and customers through our 
latest CX surveys. Our ability to attract 
and retain talent is critical to delivering 
our services. Risk exists under both 
scenarios.

Arcadis’ response 
In addition to building a Sustainability Advisory practice to assist its clients in their ability to adjust to the 
changing climate, Arcadis itself has invested in its Global Sustainability team where it now has an Impact 
& Systems team that measures and reports Arcadis’ footprint and impacts; a Future Focus team which 
looks at keeping our core services fresh and relevant; a GBA Partners team focused on helping the 
business “embed sustainability in everything we do”; and an Education & Engagement team which helps 
Arcadians understand, apply, and communicate our sustainability ambition and capabilities. Meanwhile, 
the company scores highly in sustainability ratings, such as those performed by Sustainalytics and 
Ecovadis, and also came out very favorably in the CDP analysis.
Physical climate risks in more detail
To understand the potential impact of climate change on its physical assets, Arcadis contracted a third-
party company specializing in climate risk analysis. The results of their analysis were then reviewed and 
synthesized by our Sustainability Advisory team. 
The analysis was performed by looking at 124 Arcadis offices (all leased properties), selected on the basis 
of highest number of FTEs, 44 offices in use by IBI, and 86 of the largest project sites, based on net 
revenues generated. Although our properties are all leased, this analysis was performed to understand 
our potential vulnerabilities from an in-office business continuity standpoint. At the same time, Arcadis 
has clearly demonstrated throughout the two years of the COVID crisis that an office base is not a 
necessity for business continuity on the short term for our operations. 
Analysis details include: 
Climate scenarios SSP1-2.6 (1.8°C)- Sustainable Development Scenario
SSP2-4.5 (2.7°C)- Middle of the Road
SSP5-8.5 (4.4°C)- Fossil Fuel Driven Scenario
Timescales Historical Baseline + every 5 years, 2020-2100
In total, eight climate peril metrics were part of the analysis: 
Wind   Heat
Flood    Cold
Precipitation   Wildfire

Data refinement methodology: 
• The data were filtered to include offices and projects that had an “All Peril Present-day Hazard Score” 
equal to or exceeding 50. This score is a composite and normalized globally. 
• The peril scores and peril parameters (e.g., flood depth) were intersected to understand the level of 
mitigation that would be required.
Results of the analysis were plotted into sensitivity charts and will be an important input for our Risk and 
Global Real Estate team to address risk mitigation and business continuity issues. Based on the sensitivity 
analysis, seven Arcadis offices, four IBI offices, and five projects were identified as higher priority for 
further risk evaluation and potential mitigation.
Arcadis’ response 
Arcadis has a Global Crisis Response Plan in place which addresses business continuity with a specific 
methodology and with dedicated Crisis Response Teams (CRT) in the different regions. A crisis is defined as 
an emergency event or threat of such event that may cause immediate serious injury, death to employees or 
the public, property damage, damage to the company’s image, disruption to the organization or emotional 
harm and/or a threat to business continuity. This includes any climate-related topics of a short-term nature 
(floods, storms, wildfires etc.). The Crisis Response Plan aims to protect and preserve life and the safety of 
employees and the public, protect property and assets, retain client and employee relations, minimize 
business interruption, and return the company to normal business operations as soon as possible.

Specific Diversity Reporting 
In line with applicable regulations including the Dutch Diversity Bill1 gender targets have been developed 
across all three of our most senior leadership groups:
• Supervisory Board (Arcadis NV) – at least 1/3rd of the Supervisory Board should consist of women and 
at least 1/3rd of the Supervisory Board should consist of men. Per year-end 2022, the Supervisory 
Board consists of four men (66.7%) and two women (33.3%).2
• Executive Board and Executive Leadership Team (Arcadis NV) – at least 1/3rd of the EB, and at least 
1/3rd of the ELT shall consist of women, and at least 1/3rd of the EB and at least 1/3rd of the ELT shall 
consist of men. The Executive Board consists of one woman (50%) and one man (50%). Per year-end 
2022, the Executive Leadership Team – which includes the two members of the Executive Board - 
consists of four women (57%) and three men (43%).3
• Sub-top across Arcadis globally (senior management - job level 12 and above)  – at least 22% women 
leaders by the end of 2023. Per year-end 2022, 22.1% of our defined senior leadership positions are held 
by women at Arcadis.4
The following country-based targets relate specifically to Arcadis Nederland Holding B.V. and Arcadis 
Nederland B.V:
• Supervisory Board (Arcadis Nederland Holding B.V.) – at least 1/3rd of the Supervisory Board shall 
consist of women. Per year-end 2022, the Supervisory Board consists of two women (50%) and two 
men (50%).
• Management Board at Arcadis Nederland Holding B.V. and Arcadis Nederland B.V.: at least 1/3rd of the 
Management Board shall consist of women. Per year-end 2022, the Management Board of both entities 
consists of three women (75%) and one man (25%).
• Sub-top across Arcadis (Arcadis Nederland ) – (senior management - job level 12 and above) – at least 20% 
women leaders by the end of 2023. With 19% of our defined senior leadership positions being held by 
women per year-end 2022, we are heading towards our Arcadis leadership gender diversity target for 2023.5
 
Measures Arcadis is working on to create a more gender balanced leadership
• Integration of Diversity, Belonging and Human Rights ambitions in the refresh of the Arcadis Way of 
talent management to help achieve our Diversity, Belonging and Human Rights diversity goals. 
• Continued awareness of the importance of diverse teams by reinforcing team composition guidelines in 
appointment processes.  
• As part of our global recruitment policy: 
• A commitment that all advertised senior management roles (Arcadis level 12 and above) have a 
diverse shortlist (at least one woman and one man on the shortlist) and at least one woman and one 
man as interviewers; 
• Ensuring there is a process in place to evaluate all job advertisements to ensure they are relevant, 
include the necessary skills, are non-discriminatory and gender-neutral language is used; and
• A commitment that country recruitment processes will be periodically reviewed to eliminate bias as 
much as possible. 
• As part of our Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging (DEIB) Policy Statement:
• We have the ambition to create a more gender balanced leadership in the countries in which we 
operate as a business entity. 
• Focusing on measures taken in the area of recruitment and selection and learning and development 
opportunities. For more detailed information on the targets above and the measures Arcadis is working 
on to reach these targets and therefore create a more gender balanced leadership, see the Arcadis 
action plan via the Social and Economic Council diversity portal. 
1  The requirements of the Dutch Diversity Bill entered into force on 1 January 2021 and apply to “large” Dutch companies as defined in section 2:166 and 2:276 of the Dutch Civil Code.

3  For more information on Diversity within the Executive Board and Executive Leadership Team of Arcadis NV, see the diversity paragraph in the Corporate Governance report on page 120.
4  In 2023 we will review our targets and discuss new “ambitious” and “appropriate” gender targets for Leadership.  
5  The targets for Arcadis Nederland and Arcadis globally concerning the sub-top differ from the 40% target for total workforce as the state of affairs differ. In 2023 we will review our 
targets and discuss new “ambitious” and “appropriate” gender targets for Leadership and have the ambition to align these targets (depending on the state of affairs).

Glossary non-financial & financial indicators
Glossary non-financial & financial indicators
The selected indicators that fall within the scope of limited assurance by our external  
auditor are summarized on the ‘2022 at a glance page’ on pages 2, 3 and 4 as marked with the 
symbol . 
Only the 2022 numbers for these indicators are assured under the Assurance report. These 
indicators are amongst the most material indicators for Arcadis. The indicators with limited 
assurance are based upon group consolidated numbers. Next to having these indicators in the 
‘2022 at a glance page’ they can also be found throughout this Annual Integrated Report. See 
page 265 for the Limited Assurance report of the independent auditor, which includes details 
on the scoping and outcomes. The boundary setting of the indicators is based on Arcadis NV 
and its consolidated subsidiaries (‘Arcadis’ , ‘the Group’ or ‘the Company’), aligned with the 
financial statements scope, except for the recently acquired entities Giftge Consult GmbH, 
IBI Group and DPS Group, for non-financial KPI's. For people related metrics, these 
acquisitions as well as the divestments of several business parts have been included per the 
dates of becoming effective as far as possible. Where necessary, a footnote about the scope 
of the calculations of the KPI’s is added across the total Annual Integrated Report. Arcadis 
aims to increase the assurance scope for its sustainable information in the Annual Integrated 
Report in coming years. For a description of the definitions of these indicators (and some 
others used in this Annual Integrated Report), as well as relevant accounting considerations, 
please refer to the following sections.
Term Definition
Non-financial Workforce Workforce is defined as individuals and companies that have an employment agreement with Arcadis, according to national law or its application (i.e. employees and contingent workers). The 
workforce is measured in an absolute number at the balance sheet date.
Employees Individuals that are in an employment agreement with Arcadis, according to national law or its application (i.e. employees). Employees exclude contingent workers, such as consultants and 
agency workers.
FTE Workforce expressed in FTE (Full Time Equivalent).
Permanent Employees This includes everybody on the payroll with an employment agreement that is not temporary in nature. This is measured in an absolute number at the balance sheet date.
Temporary Employees This includes individuals on the payroll with an employment agreement that is temporary in nature. This is measured in an absolute number at the balance sheet date.
Contingent Workers These are individuals that are hired for a service from other companies for a limited duration such as consultants and agency workers. This is measured in an absolute number at the balance 
sheet date.
Voluntary Turnover rate Voluntary termination of permanent employees (see definition above) divided by the average number of permanent employees during the period. A termination is voluntary when the 
decision for termination is made by the employee. People going on retirement are not seen as ‘voluntary’ as it is initiated by local legislation. The rate is calculated as a percentage covering 
the calendar year.
Involuntary Turnover rate Involuntary termination of permanent employees (see definition above) divided by the average number of permanent employees during the period. A termination is involuntary when the 
decision for termination of an employee is initiated by the employer, local legislation and/or unforeseen circumstances. The rate is calculated as a percentage covering the calendar year.
Women in total workforce Number of permanent and temporary women employed at Arcadis as a % of total permanent and temporary employees. This calculation is based on absolute numbers and where the gender

Non-financial Employee Engagement The eNPS (Employee Net Promoter Score) measures our employee engagement. On a scale of -100 to +100, the eNPS score determines to what extent employees promote Arcadis as a 
place to work and therefore helps us ascertain how we are progressing on our journey to be a best place to work The eNPS is only measured for permanent employees and is calculated 
by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of. Our final score is based on  four quarterly  engagement surveys throughout the year, with our last survey in 
December 2022. 
Top Management Employees on job level 12 to maximum of 14 with people management responsibility.
Middle Management Employees on job level 9 to 11 with people management responsibility.
Junior Management Employees on job level 5 to 8 with people management responsibility.
Age Is calculated based on the recorded legal birth date of permanent employees (see definition above). In some cases birth dates were not disclosed or recorded and have been labelled unspecified.
Performance Development Permanent employees (see definition above) who received a performance and career development discussion during the reporting period. 
Training Refers to time or expenditure spent preparing and attending training events, E-learning, mentoring, coaching and internal/ external conference

Number of appointed privacy officers under the 
Privacy policies 
This is the absolute number of Privacy Officers at Arcadis per each relevant business unit who will report to the Global Privacy Officer in accordance with the Arcadis Privacy Standards.
Arcadis’ carbon footprint (MT CO2 per FTE) Arcadis’ carbon footprint consists of the total metric tons of CO2 equivalents from material scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions,
Gross direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions in metric tons of CO2 equivalent, including the methodology used to calculate GHG emission inventories. This includes company owned vehicles 
(purchased or leased for > 6 months) and stationary energy (e.g., natural gas for heating) consumption at the offices.
Gross location-based energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions in metric tons of CO2 equivalent and gross market-based energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions in metric tons of CO2 
equivalent, including the methodology used to calculate GHG emission inventories. This includes electricity and district heating/cooling if used in the respective office.
Gross indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions in metric tons of CO2 equivalent from the scope 3 sources as described under “In our scope 3 we currently include” . The general carbon accounting 
policies and emission factors are described below.
General carbon accounting policies  
and emission factors
Our emissions calculations are based on the GHG Protocol “A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard“ (World Resources Institute and World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development, March 2004), as well as the “GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance” and the “Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard” .
The organizational boundaries of Arcadis are drawn up using the so-called 'Operational control approach'. This means that Arcadis takes responsibility for the emissions of the business units 
over which it has operational control.
Emissions resulting from potential releases of refrigerants from fridges or air conditioners are not considered as assumed to be non-material, but the electricity consumption for the 
installations is considered.
As emission factors, the factors from Defra v11 (09/2022) have been used and for electricity, the factors from IEA v5 (12/2022) have been applied for scope 2 (location-based). For the 
market-based scope 2 footprint, our renewable electricity purchases via direct contracts or (i)RECs/GOs have been taken into account with a factor of 0. For Scope 3 Category 1,2 and 5, 
spend-based EEIO emission factors have been used.
Scope 3 definition and boundary setting In our scope 3 we currently include Category 1: Purchased Goods and Services, Category 2: Capital goods, Category 3: Fuel-and-energy-related activities (not included in Scope 1 or 2), 
Category 5: Waste generated in operations, Category 6: business travel (including airplanes, private vehicles, short-term hired vehicles, taxi, and public transportation), and Category 7: 
Employee commuting (also including WFH (emissions from working from home)). Any other scope 3 categories are not reported as previous screenings showed that these are not material to 
our footprint. We consider the indirect emissions over which Arcadis has limited influence. To illustrate: employees have the choice to meet the business mobility need in different ways, for 
example with their private car. Arcadis is responsible for the emissions but has no direct influence on the choice that is made and the type of car that the employee drives. For scope 3 category 
3 - Fuel-and-energy-related activities (not included in Scope 1 or 2), consumption is captured in our NFR platform by each country and calculated according to the mapped emission factors. 
For scope 3 category 6 - Business travel, data is collected by an external provider, Thrust Carbon, directly from our travel agencies. For scope 3 category 7 - Employee commuting incl. working 
from home (WFH), data was collected via a global employee survey (overall response rate of 31% that was scaled based on headcount).

Non-financial Estimates As we publish our AIR early in the year, we don’t have all final emissions data points by the time our AIR gets published, e.g., for December electricity consumptions at some locations. 
Therefore, we work with estimates for these missing data points and publish an update on our webpage in the 2nd quarter of 2023. When final data is not available, an estimation was 
calculated. For consumptions not depending on the climate (like electricity for workstations and lighting), an extrapolation is made based on historical data all previous months of the same 
year, or if not available, on the previous year. In rare cases where also previous year’s data is not available, as a fallback option and conservative estimate, a global average of 25 kWh/m2year in 
electricity and 0.8 m3/m2year in natural gas is applied (if applicable). These global standardized numbers may be replaced by a better local average (e.g., from the same climate zone) when 
correct documentation can be provided (source, conversion factor, etc.). The use of climate-depending energy (e.g., natural gas, heat (district heating), electricity for heating or cooling if 
measured separately) is calculated in proportion to the number of heating or cooling degree days.
Number of identified environmental  
non-compliances 
Environmental violations or notices of violations from a regulatory environmental authority where a monetary civil penalty of an amount higher than €10,000,- was imposed on Arcadis. The 
identified environmental non-compliances are measured in absolute numbers.
Investigated AGBP alleged breaches Number of assessed and, as needed, investigated AGBP alleged breaches, as part of the Arcadis AGBP Issue Reporting & Handling Procedure.
Employees passing Code of Conduct training  
(as % of total staff) 
Percentage of employees that have successfully passed training on Arcadis' General Business Principles and code of conduct, including anti-corruption, bribery, conflicts of interest, 
anti-competitive practices, and other risks. From 2023 onwards each active employee must pass the training every year. The number is expressed as percentage, calculated by dividing the 
number of employees that successfully passed the training by the total number of active employees.
Lost Time Case Frequency  
(LTCF, per 200,000 work hours)
The Lost Time Case Frequency (LTCF) is calculated as a ratio of cases per 200,000 worked hours using the formula LTCF = (LTI x 200,000 hrs)/ Work Hours. The cases are calculated as LTI (Lost 
Time Injuries) = PTD + LWC using the following abbreviations:
PTD (Permanent Total Disability) = Number can be taken from injury/occupational illness logs or investigation sheets. LWC (Lost Workday Cases) = Number can be taken from injury/
occupational illness logs or investigation sheets.
Note that cases are only recorded for Arcadis employees, not for contingent workers nor subcontractors. Hours are based on Arcadis employees as well.
Total Recordable Case Frequency 
(TRCF, per 200,000 work hours)
Lagging performance indicator, like TRCF, are indicators mirroring past occurrences. TRCF is one of the indicators that is generally used by Arcadis clients to qualify or monitor the H&S 
performance of Arcadis.
In some countries, the law requires companies to use different definitions as well as different measuring and calculation methods for reporting H&S Performance data. Arcadis companies shall 
comply with these requirements. For reporting H&S data for the global organization, Arcadis countries apply and report the parameters and performance indicators according to OSHA 
requirements. 
The Total Recordable Case Frequency (TRCF  ) is calculated as a ratio of cases per 200,000 worked hours using the formula TRCF = (TRC x 200,000 hrs)/ Work Hours. The cases are calculated 
as TRC (Total Recordable Cases) = F + PTD + LWC + RWC + MTC using the following abbreviations:
F (Fatalities) = Number can be taken from injury/ occupational illness logs or investigation sheets.
PTD (Permanent Total Disability) = Number can be taken from injury/ occupational illness logs or investigation sheets. LWC (Lost Workday Cases) = Number can be taken from injury/
occupational illness logs or investigation sheets.
RWC (Restricted Work Cases) = Number can be taken from injury/occupational illness logs or investigation sheets. 
MTC (Medical Treatment Cases) = Number can be taken from injury/occupational illness logs or investigation sheets.
Note that cases are only recorded for Arcadis employees, not for contingent workers nor subcontractors. Hours are based on Arcadis employees as well.
Financial Gross revenues The gross inflow of economic benefits during the period arising in the course of ordinary activities. Gross revenues of Arcadis consist of external revenues net of value-added tax, rebates and 
discounts and after eliminating sales within the Arcadis Group.
Net revenues Gross revenues minus materials, services of third parties and subcontractors, which are project-related costs of materials and services charged by third parties, including cost of subcontractor. 
Net revenues entail revenues produced by the activities of Arcadis own staff.
Dividend per share Dividends issued by Arcadis for every outstanding ordinary share.
EBITA Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, and Amortization/Impairment of goodwill and/or identifiable assets.
EBITDA Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization/Impairment of goodwill and/or identifiable assets. 
Operating EBITA EBITA excluding restructuring, integration, disposal and acquisition related costs and net result from divestments.
Operating EBITA margin Operating EBITA as percentage of net revenues.
