NSI’s stated purpose is: “We enable our customers to achieve maximum productivity and growth, 
providing best-in-class, flexible space solutions and an unparalleled level of services in modern, 
healthy, sustainable buildings in prime locations”.
PURPOSE AND LONG TERM  
VALUE CREATION
This purpose has served as a clear guide to all our decisions and 
initiatives in recent years, both with respect to real estate and 
services. We have consistently worked back from the customer’s 
needs to the real estate and services.
The post covid ‘return to office’ has made very clear what an 
office should offer: a great place for collaboration, identity and 
culture, but also a way to attract talent by way of offering modern, 
healthy, high quality, sustainable space, in vibrant locations, with 
a good mix of workstations, meeting rooms, collaborative space 
and focus rooms, complemented by a variety of amenities.
Our long term value creation model is based on the above purpose. 
We strive to become the leading Dutch real estate company, by effec-
tively and efficiently utilising the permanent capital entrusted to us to 
deliver on our strategy to invest in (and where possible create) vibrant 
multifunctional urban areas where people want to work, live and play, 
underpinned by sustainability, well-being and services.
We generate long term attractive returns by investing in real estate in 
those specific locations, as we see an ongoing trend where tenants 
are upgrading to better locations, with a clear focus on sustainability, 
health and well-being and a sufficient level of services. As such, 
providing the right space in the right location, with services to match, 
is key to success. 
We also genuinely believe that the real estate industry has a role to 
play in reducing the use of the earth’s limited resources and leaving a 
better world for the next generation, as the industry currently is known 
to make up over 30% of all CO
2 emissions. To recognise our respon-
sibility here, we have positioned the environment and climate as a 
pre-eminent (albeit silent) stakeholder in our value creation model. As 
such, sustainability is deeply rooted in all our decision-making and 
activities.
We constantly strive to improve the quality of our offering. We can only 
deliver this with an excellent team of ambitious professionals. We aim 
to be a great place to work, where our employees feel engaged and 
connected, and can help to set and exceed our joint ambitions.

ESG – THE FUTURE IS HERE
Sustainability is an integral part of NSI’s long term value creation 
strategy. Our business model is geared towards decarbonising 
our portfolio by reducing energy usage, owning and developing 
flexible and adaptive buildings, and creating inspiring, flexible 
working environments articulated around the health and well-
being of our occupants.
Last year we presented our refreshed sustainability strategy, “The Future 
is here”. We have always acknowledged the ever-changing nature of 
ESG and the need to respond accordingly. With this in mind, we have 
further sharpened our strategy this year to present a more precise view 
of our three pillars and have expanded our third pillar to encompass a 
broader social component. 
We are pleased about our 5-star GRESB rating for a third year running 
and our first ever EPRA sBPR gold award. We have also mentioned that 
our ambition goes further than this and it does: this year we have taken 
a significant step forward in our sustainability journey by creating and 
costing a roadmap to align our portfolio with the 1.5c Paris Agreement.  
We have also performed a thorough analysis of our portfolio to 
determine its alignment with the EU Taxonomy for sustainable 
investments which we view as the key guideline for the inevitable 
alignment of economic and environmental interests. 
When we defined ‘The Future is here’ it was our intention for it to 
reflect the urgency to act now, our commitment to do what is neces-
sary, and our appreciation for the challenges of today that will shape 
the industry tomorrow. A year on we are more convinced than ever 
that a robust, ambitious and comprehensive sustainability strategy 
will be a key component for our business’ long term success. 
MATERIALITY MATRIX
The success of our sustainability strategy and efforts depends on 
ongoing dialogue and engagement with internal and external stake-
holders, through which NSI continuously validates and examines 
the relevance of the ESG topics on which NSI focuses. The basis 
for our strategy was an initial extensive assessment performed in 
2018, which was recalibrated in 2020. To align with this timeframe, 
NSI has updated the materiality assessment again in 2022. 
The 2022 update of the materiality matrix included a revision of the 
topics assessed. As the field of climate change is ever-evolving, some 
topics might have become more urgent or significant to NSI as others. 
NSI has therefore updated the list of ESG topics in the 2022 revision, 
to better reflect the topics that are relevant, now and in the future. 
NSI has performed a CSRD gap analysis and will continue with the 
implementation of CSRD in 2023, which is expected to become appli-
cable to NSI in 2025.

IMPORTANCE TO STAKEHOLDERS
IMPORTANCE TO NSI
In the 2022 update, a survey was held amongst investors (external 
stakeholders, vertical axis) and NSI’s management and employees 
(internal stakeholders, horizontal axis). The resulting materiality matrix 
indicates the ranking of importance of the ESG topics, comparing the 
external and internal focus. The top-right corner of the materiality matrix 
indicates the ESG topics that are most material to both stakeholder 
groups, and will receive the additional focus from NSI. The assessed 
topics are categorised following NSI’s existing ESG strategy and corre-
sponding themes: Future-proof investments, Energy & Carbon, Health 
& Wellbeing, and transcending topics (which focus on issues related to 
governance).  A notable result of the assessment is the high importance 
of the topic Net Zero Carbon according to both internal and external 
stakeholders. This underlines the urgency and importance of reducing 
our carbon footprint and to support the transition to a net zero carbon 
economy. The materiality matrix also shows a focus on the reduction of 
the carbon footprint – topics such as material use, our impact on natural 
systems, as well as climate change related risks, are considered mate-
rial to both stakeholder groups. 
OUR AMBITION
In line with our revisited strategy, we have also sharpened our existing pillars ‘Energy and carbon’ and ‘Future-proof buildings’, while we 
have expanded and renamed our third pillar, ‘Social engagement’, to encompass a broader social component. This has allowed us to 
articulate our commitments more concretely: 
ENERGY AND CARBON FUTURE-PROOF BUILDINGS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT
We are committed to aligning our 
portfolio to a Paris-compliant decar-
bonisation trajectory and striving 
towards net-zero: 
We aim to own buildings that are  
resilient, adaptative and aligned with 
the EU Taxonomy, now or in time.  
We strive to be a long-term positive 
influence on our clients, employees 
and communities.  
OUR COMMITMENT
       We are committed to decreasing our 
energy intensity in line with the 1.5c 
scenario decarbonisation pathway. 
       100% of procured energy from renewable 
sources.
       Offset where not economically viable to 
reduce emissions through energy efficiency 
gains / renewable energy procurement. 
OUR COMMITMENT 
       Own assets that are aligned with the EU

 OUR COMMITMENT TO DECARBONISATION: 
WALKING THE TALK
NSI is using the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor’s (CRREM) 
decarbonisation pathways as a point of reference to set energy 
reduction targets for our portfolio. CRREM is the leading global 
initiative for operational decarbonisation of real estate assets in 
order to avoid stranding risk, address transition risk and comply 
with climate-science and Paris-aligned decarbonisation targets. 
CRREM establishes country and asset-specific energy and GHG 
reduction pathways.
According to CRREM, for Dutch offices to be compliant with the 
1.5c Paris scenario, buildings must achieve 85 kWh/m2/year by 
2034, as per the pathway below. At year-end 2022 the total (tenant 
+ building-related) average energy consumption of our portfolio 
was 131 kWh/m2/year. While this is well above the 85 kWh/m 2/ 
Dutch office CRREM year target, NSI is far below the Dutch 
office CRREM target for 2022, of 164 kWh/m2/year. Based on this 
starting point, if we were to take no further action, NSI’s overall 
intensity would no longer comply with the CRREM pathway by 
2026. 
In 2023 we will start executing our Paris-alignment investment 
plan. The total investment for the first 32 assets (ca. 70% of assets 
by value) is ca. € 58m over the next 10 years. On completion these 
assets should see their energy intensity reduce significantly, from 
116 kWh/m2/year to 80 kWh/m 2/year, well below the CRREM 
target. See the ‘NSI roadmap to align with the Paris Agreement’ 
section for more details and substantiation.
We are committed to aligning our portfolio to a Paris-compliant 
decarbonisation trajectory and striving towards net-zero:
  We are committed to decreasing our energy intensity in line 
with the 1.5c scenario decarbonisation pathway. 
  All electricity procured by NSI is obtained from renewable 
sources.
  We will offset remaining carbon emissions only after all other 
financially viable measures have been exhausted.

SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY
–  Note that the above trajectory does not take into account the 
effect of weather. Energy intensity at any given point in time is 
highly dependent on the weather (cold winters, hot summers). 
Whilst weather effects will even out over longer periods of time, 
to measure progress in any given year we will have to adjust 
the actual energy intensity for degree days to properly measure 
our short term progress in reducing the energy intensity of the 
portfolio. We have not yet corrected for this so far.
–  Because the majority of NSI’s emissions (scope 1, 2, 3) stem 
from energy usage, we are steering on the energy intensity 
curves as our main reference and have calculated the resulting 
GHG emissions using the market-based conversion factors. 
–  Our focus is on the actual energy intensity of our buildings: both 
building-related and tenant-driven energy consumption. As the 
target of 85 kWh/m2/year includes both building-related energy 
consumption and tenant-driven energy consumption, reaching 
the target will have to be joint exercise between tenant and land-
lord. 
–  The square meters used in our calculations are an approxima-
tion. CRREM uses Gross Floor area minus internal garage and 
outer facade. NSI used to report according to EPRA best prac-
tices, i.e Gross Floor Area. Based on the available floor plans we 
have estimated the difference between the two measures to be 
approximately 6%. We have made an adjustment to the 2021 
figures to reflect this. 
–  As we approach higher efficiency levels, the incremental impact 
of improvements that are sometimes too uneconomic is why we 
focus on a portfolio average rather than each asset in isolation: 
in some cases, getting close to the target is not only sufficient 
but desirable from a cost, energy efficiency and total life cycle 
assessment of the building. 
GOING BEYOND EPC LABELS
Formally the only sustainability regulatory requirement in the Nether-
lands for the renting out of commercial space is to have an EPC 
label of at least C as of 1 Jan 2023. At NSI we are already well 
ahead of that target (88% at label A, only 4% at C, no assets below 
C) and we consider a more ambitious goal to be necessary both 
from the perspective of climate urgency as well as from a client 
demand and regulatory point of view. Indeed, EPC does not suffi-
ciently represent a Paris-aligned solution as it focuses on theoret-
ical versus actual usage. Given the urgency in adopting a science-
based solution to climate mitigation plus increased energy costs, 
we see more benefits in choosing a more complete approach. 
  100% OF PROCURED ELECTRICITY SHOULD COME 
FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES
All electricity procured by NSI is 100% green, procured from renew-
able sources (European wind) . The total average share of renew-
able energy used is 57.7% (European wind grid energy + solar 
panel generation of electricity + geothermal energy).
 OFFSET REMAINING CARBON
We will offset remaining carbon emissions only after all other finan-
cially viable measures have been exhausted. 
We aim to reduce our carbon footprint through an increase in 
energy efficiency and the procurement, where possible, of energy 
from renewable sources. Offsets are therefore only a measure of 
last resort, after all other solutions have been exhausted. Currently, 
natural gas procurement is fully compensated using Gold Standards 
CO2.

 Own assets that are aligned with the EU Taxonomy, now or in time
 Minimum BREEAM rating for assets is “Very Good”
  Focus on Climate resilience: physical risk assessment with a  
mitigation plan for every asset
 Incorporate Biodiversity strategy
The taxonomy defines 6 environmental objectives. 
–  Climate change mitigation
– Climate change adaptation
–  The sustainable use and protection of water and marine 
resources
– The transition to a circular economy
– Pollution prevention and control
– The protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystem
NSI’S TAXONOMY ALIGNMENT
–  An analysis was performed on NSI’s portfolio based on the 
Taxonomy-recognised activity of “Acquisition and Owner-
ship of buildings”. The objective to which this activity contrib-
utes is “Climate change mitigation” defined as “contributing 
to the stabilisation of greenhouse gas emissions by avoiding 
or reducing them or by enhancing greenhouse gas removals”. 
To prove this, the activity must comply with specific Technical 
Screening Criteria (TSC)- a set of conditions specific to this 
activity.
–  The TSC for substantial contribution for the economic activity 
“Acquisition and ownership of buildings”, largely depend on 
the type of buildings in scope (residential vs non-residential), 
the date on which the building was built (different conditions for 
buildings built before or after 31 December 2020) and on the 
energy performance. 
–  In order to ensure that the activity does no significantly harm to 
the other objectives, it should be verified that adaptation solu-
tions are put in place to tackle the climate risk hazards which 
have been assessed as “material”.
–  The analysis was performed on each individual asset based 
on the TSC for the Acquisition and ownership of buildings as 
defined by the EU taxonomy. Through a climate risk hazard and 
mitigation plan the DNSH condition was assessed. 
  OWN ASSETS THAT ARE ALIGNED WITH THE EU 
TAXONOMY OF SUSTAINABLE ACTIVITIES, NOW OR IN TIME
We aim to own assets that are aligned, now or in time, with the EU 
taxonomy, the classification system that translates the EU’s climate 
and environmental objectives into criteria for specific economic 
activities for investment purposes. In order to determine alignment 
to the EU Taxonomy, the economic activity of the company must 
first be eligible. If the activity is not defined in the screening criteria, 
it is not eligible under the EU Taxonomy and therefore, it cannot 
be considered as environmentally sustainable. Second, once the 
economic activity has been deemed eligible, it must be determined 
that it makes a substantial contribution to at least one of the EU’s 
climate and environmental objectives, while at the same time not 
significantly harming (DNSH – do no significant harm) any of the 
other objectives and meeting minimum social safeguards.

–  In this analysis, all our assets were assessed against the activity 
“acquisition and ownership of buildings”. As a result, invest-
ment properties under construction and renovations are not 
aligned with the EU taxonomy based on this activity. We will 
explore in 2023 alignment against other EU taxonomy-eligible 
relevant activities for these buildings. 
–  Based on the technical assessment (points 2.1 and 2.2 of the 
chart above) our alignment would be as follows:
The minimum safeguards analysis (2.3) on company level is still 
outstanding and will be performed in 2023 to assess alignment with 
the applicable EU Taxonomy scope.
The extensive EPRA taxonomy eligibility and alignment table 
against revenue, capex and opex can be found on pages 145-147.
  MINIMUM BREEAM RATING FOR ASSETS IS “VERY GOOD”
We view sustainability not only as a responsibility but ultimately as 
a driver of value creation. BREEAM seeks to improve the opera-
tional performance of buildings through sustainable improve-
ments. The BREEAM assessment method involves nine areas: 
management, health, energy, transport, water, materials, waste, 
land use, ecology and pollution. 96% of the assets in NSI’s port-
folio now have a BREEAM certificate vs 89% in 2021. 
In 2022 NSI’s made significant strides in its ambition to obtain 
an at least “very good” label for its standing assets: a majority of 
our assets (66%) now have either a Very Good or Excellent Label. 
 FOCUS ON CLIMATE RESILIENCE:
PHYSICAL RISK ASSESSMENT WITH A MITIGATION PLAN FOR 
EVERY ASSET
Assessing and mitigating climate change and the associated risks 
are an integral part of our approach towards a future-proof port-
folio. A further analysis was not only required in view of complying 
with the EU taxonomy (DNSH assessment), it also increasingly 
weighs on investment and portfolio decisions. NSI performed an 
assessment of the net risks of climate change related heat stress 
and flooding of its portfolio, also taking individual asset char-
acteristics into consideration. The assessment included which 
measures can be taken to mitigate these risks. 
This assessment identified that from its 49 assets 9 assets are poten-
tially exposed to a higher risk of heat stress and 12 assets to a higher 
risk of flooding. Measures to mitigate these risks have been inte-
grated in the asset plans, and will be executed in the coming years.  
More details on climate risk analyses can be found on page 47.
 INCORPORATE BIODIVERSITY STRATEGY: 
In line with sustainability best practices, NSI aims to establish a

sustainability efforts.

  MAKE HEALTH AND WELLBEING A PRIORITY
FOR OUR OUR CUSTOMERS
NSI actively engages with customers through a yearly customer satisfac-
tion survey. In 2022 NSI achieved a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of + 10.3 
from its tenants, down from + 20.3 a year ago. HNK’s NPS was 19.9 vs 
23.7 in 2021. The NPS measures customer experience and predicts busi-
ness growth. The NPS is calculated using the answer to a key question, 
using a 0-10 scale e.g. How likely is it that you would recommend NSI 
to a friend or colleague?1 NSI’s score of + 10.3 is a positive score which 
means that there are more promoters than detractors. With sustainability 
also being a key concern for our clients, we have rolled out a communica-
tions program to better engage with our customers on this topic. Initia-
tives, air quality and improvements are shared through narrow casting 
screens, the Office App and newsletter. 
FOR OUR EMOPLOYEES
NSI actively engages  with employees through a employee satisfaction 
survey. NSI currently performs an employee engagement survey every 
two years. The result is an eNPS (employee Net Promotor Score), which 
measures staff engagement and involves asking employees “How likely 
would you be to recommend (score 0-10) us as an employer?”. NSI’s 
most recent eNPS score was 29.3 (2021), which qualifies as a high score.  
Furthermore we performed a Leesman Workplace Survey in 2022. Read 
more on page 52 (Great Place to Work) about our employee engagement 
activities.
 STRIVE TO HAVE A DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE WORKFORCE
NSI is committed to fostering a fair and inclusive working environment. 
Our culture is based on the principles of mutual respect and non-discrim-
ination irrespective of nationality, age, disability, gender, religion or sexual 
orientation. At NSI we currently have 48% male and 52% female work-
force. In 2023 NSI will establish a diversity and inclusion policy. 
 GIVING BACK TO OUR COMMUNITIES
Creating a positive socio-economic impact in local communities in and 
around our assets is important to us. We aim to play an active role in our 
communities by building lasting relationships with local stakeholders and 
by supporting organizations with a social purpose.
We strive to be a long-term positive influence on our customers, 
employees and communities. 
SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT
URBAN LAND INSTITUTE PROGRAM
The mission of the Urban Land Institute is to ‘Shape the future of the built 
environment for transformative impact in communities worldwide’. One 
of its programs, UrbanPlan, is supported by NSI. This is an educational 
program aimed at students between 15 and 18 years old, with the goal of 
increasing young people's understanding of urban development. 
PHILIPS INNOVATION AWARDS | SPONSORSHIP TO STIMULATE 
INNOVATION AMONG STUDENTS
It is important to NSI to promote innovation and contribute to Dutch 
society. That is why HNK has been a Gold Partner of the Philips Innova-
tion Award since 2017. The Philips Innovation Award is an entrepreneur-
ship prize awarded to students with an innovative start-up concept.
DONATION TO BREAST CARE FOUNDATION 
The Breast Care Foundation raises funds to support patients who have 
breast cancer or other breast disorders. The foundation focuses on 
enabling full recovery, including paramedical and additional (after) care, 
and on promoting awareness and information, prevention, science and 
paramedical care in a broad sense. NSI has chosen to support this 
foundation following the loss of a dear colleague due to this devastating 
disease. 
DONATION TO RONALD MCDONALD KINDERFONDS
NSI made a donation to the Ronald McDonald Children's Fund. One of 
the Ronald Mc Donald locations, where hospitalised children and their 
families can be close to each other, is in Amsterdam Southeast.
GREEN BUSINESS CLUB ZUIDAS
NSI participates in the Green Business Club Zuidas. This network organi-
zation creates impact by initiating sustainable projects in the Amsterdam 
Zuidas area and aspires to make the Zuidas the most sustainable, livable 
and workable area in the Netherlands. The network aims to realize this by 
collaborating in partnerships and sharing best practices and knowledge.
UPTOWN SLOTERDIJK 
NSI participates with nine other parties in UPTown Sloterdijk to help 
promote the transformation of this area into an attractive urban district. All 
participants (APG, BPD, CBRE, EDGE, the municipality of Amsterdam, 
Heijmans, Synchroon and TMG) are actively linked to the area and have 
an interest in the development of the neighbourhood. 
ONDERNEMERSFONDS UTRECHT
NSI made a donation to Ondernemersfonds Utrecht (Entrepreneurs Fund 
Utrecht). This fund connects local entrepreneurs, various sectors and 
organizations with the aim of promoting the quality of business in Utrecht.
1   Respondents are grouped as follows:  Promoters (score 9-10) are loyal enthusiasts who will 
keep buying and refer others, fueling growth; Passives (score 7-8) are satisfied but unenthusi-
astic customers who are vulnerable to competitive offerings; Detractors (score 0-6) are unhappy 
customers who can damage your brand and impede growth through negative word-of-mouth.

THE NSI ROADMAP TO ALIGN WITH THE 
PARIS AGREEMENT
TAKING THE "E" IN ESG TO A NEW STANDARD
At NSI we have been a long standing advocate of sustainability, both 
at the corporate and at the asset level. We use GRESB at the corpo-
rate level to track our progress and success, whilst at the asset level 
we focus on EPC, BREEAM and more recently on CRREM.
We fully appreciate that the sustainability question is a complex 
one. There is no single metric or solution to square the circle. 
GRESB, EPC, BREEAM, CRREM and EU Taxonomy alignment all 
have a role to play in achieving our sustainability goals.
FROM EPC LABELS TO CRREM ALIGNMENT
The key downside of the EPC labelling system is that it is based 
on the theoretical energy usage of a building, not on the actual 
energy usage, and that it ignores the energy consumption by 
tenants. EPC labels are, however, relevant as a key input for both 
BREEAM and the EU taxonomy alignment assessment.
Our ambition is to reduce the actual energy intensity of all our 
buildings, in line with the aims of the Paris agreement as set in 
2016. This goes beyond the formal regulatory requirement of EPC 
label C, which is in place in The Netherlands since January 2023 
and with which we fully comply, because 1) we believe it is the 
right thing to do, 2) tenants will increasingly demand it, and 3) the 
regulatory requirements are likely to become more stringent in the 
period ahead.
Given the shortcomings of EPC, we have chosen to use the 
CRREM (carbon risk real estate monitor) methodology as a tool 
to track our progress in reducing the energy intensity over time, 
as CRREM measures the actual energy intensity of buildings, 
including both the building-related and tenant-driven energy 
consumption.
CRREM has calculated that for Dutch offices to be aligned with 
the Paris agreement, the energy intensity should be reduced to 
below 85 kWh/m2/year by 2034. This is more or less in line with 
the target for other European office markets. At year-end 2022 the 
energy intensity of our portfolio was 131 kWh/m2/year (113 kWh/
m2/year excluding the Leiden life science assets).
As the objective is to reduce the total energy intensity of our 
portfolio, both building-related and tenant-driven, meeting the 
CRREM target will end up being a joint exercise between tenant 
and landlord. Lease contracts will increasingly have to include 
language to allow and facilitate for this. Having said that, we 
recognise the effort will predominantly lie with the owner, as a 
typical office tenant nowadays only uses 20-25 kWh/m2/year.
During 2022 we established a detailed plan to bring the energy 
intensity of the portfolio to below 85 kWh/m2/year by 2034. An 
investment plan has been created for each asset, including 
time line, to reach this target. Plans at the asset level include a 
mixture of replacing window frames/glazing, extra insulation, 
further upgrades to technical installations, improved sealing, solar 
panels, etc.
STARTING WITH THE FIRST 32 ASSETS FROM 2023 
ONWARDS
In our analysis we exclude the near term development program as 
Paris-alignment is already part of the project scope and cost. We 
have also decided to exclude the life science labs in Leiden for 
now, as these buildings have a much higher energy intensity due 
to the specialised nature of lab activities, which we cannot influ-
ence as a landlord. We have also identified a number of assets 
which we view as complex and where further analysis is required 
in the period ahead.
This leaves 32 assets, making up 71% of the portfolio by value, 
where we are fully comfortable with the analysis and viability of 
the plans. We will start with these plans from this year onwards.
We will look to fit the timing of our sustainability initiatives with 
our regular maintenance cycle as much as possible. Over time 
we will track the actual results versus our model assumptions and 
adjust the plans where necessary. The prospect of new, cheaper, 
technical innovations to help reach targets will also see us adjust 
plans as appropriate.

For the above 32 assets we expect a significant reduction in 
energy intensity on completion of our investment plans, from 116 
kWh/m2/year to 80 kWh/m2/year, below the CRREM target.
This will reduce the energy consumption by 9.8 MWh/year (37 
kWh/m2/year on 268k sqm), which based on an electricity price of 
ca. € 0.2/kWh represents an economic value of € 2.0m.
THE ECONOMICS OF SUSTAINABILITY ARE FAVOURABLE
The estimated investment capex for the 32 assets is € 58m, over 
a ca. 10 year period. This equates to just over one year of rent for 
these assets, or ca. 7% of the current asset value.

in annual rent roll. This in turn would represent a value of ca.  
€ 50m, based on the current 6.5% gross yield for the portfolio and 
this would more or less cover the cost of the entire investment 
plan. Overall, we expect the economic benefit to be greater still, 
as we believe energy-efficient, highly sustainable, assets will not 
only see higher rents, but structurally benefit from lower vacancy 
and lower yield as well.
This analysis is the first step in a new journey for NSI. We are 
excited about the journey ahead and expect to learn along the 
way. We are certain it is a necessary and eventually rewarding 
journey, for the planet, the business and all our stakeholders. 
On an investment of € 58m the € 2.0m in actual energy savings 
represent a return of ‘only’ 3.5%. This benefit/return largely falls 
to the tenants, as lower service charges, although undoubtedly 
some of this will eventually flow back to us, as owner.
Recent research by some leading real estate agents increasingly 
points to evidence that tenant demand is shifting to the most 
sustainable buildings, which achieve a ca. 6% rent premium as 
a result.
Taking into account this possible 6% rent premium, for the 32 
assets in our analysis, this would equate to a ca. € 3.2m increase

CLIMATE RISKS
CLIMATE RISKS ANALYSIS
DROUGHT
Drought is measured according to the potential lack of rainfall 
over a longer period. As our climate changes, the Netherlands is 
expected to experience longer periods of warmer weather and 
a lack of precipitation.
While increased droughts can greatly affect the Dutch ecosystem 
and the agricultural sector, buildings can also be severely 
affected through land subsidence and rotting of wooden pile 
foundations as groundwater levels decrease. 
HEAT
Heat stress is commonly defined as a physiological condition 
provoked by extreme heat, causing humans and animals to be 
unable to shed their heat and thereby overheating. There are 
several methods to approximate heat stress using geographic 
modelling. One such method is describing heat using the 
number of tropical days (≥ 30ºC) experienced per year. By 2050, 
the Netherlands is likely to experience temperatures higher 
than 35ºC at least once or twice a year. Since people spend 
on average 90% of their time indoors, managing the impact of 
these heatwaves on the indoor environment and a building’s 
ability to retain a productive working climate and temperature 
will be crucial.
The analysis was enriched in 2022 with more granular data 
about the buildings. The results of the risk analysis indicate that 
7 assets have potentially a high risk and 2 assets score very high 
(out of a total of 49 assets). 
PLUVIAL FLOODING (HEAVY RAINFALL)
It is expected that the amount of rainfall and the intensity of rainfall 
events in the Netherlands will increase significantly in the coming 30 
years. Increase in heavy rainfall increases the risk of pluvial flooding. 
Pluvial flooding causes risks because of inflow of water to buildings 
as well as potential problems with accessibility of buildings. 
It is expected that the amount of rainfall and the intensity of rainfall 
events in the Netherlands will increase significantly in the coming 30 
years. Increase in heavy rainfall increases the risk of pluvial flooding. 
Pluvial flooding causes risks because of inflow of water to buildings 
as well as potential problems with accessibility of buildings. 
The results of the risk analysis performed in 2022 indicate that 12 
assets have potentially a high risk (out of a total of 49 assets). There 
were no assets that scored ‘very high’. 
SOCIO-ECONOMIC RISKS
The physical hazards that result from climate change, can and will 
continue to have a significant effect on the quality of human life. 
In addition to the physical hazards which could potentially affect 
the resilience and accessibility of assets, there are related socio-
economic issues that need to be taken into consideration which 
could have an impact on an asset’s value.
NSI can mitigate and adapt to these impacts through ensuring their 
assets are well connected and surrounded by green (space) and 
blue infrastructure (water elements). These measures can not only 
enhance the workability and usability of their assets but can also 
help reduce their vulnerability to the physical impacts of climate 
change. These measures should be taken in cooperation with local 
governments whenever possible. 
Both physical- and transition risk analyses provide additional 
insight into the overall risk profile of NSI’s portfolio.
We are using Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) for 
assessing and addressing transitional risk. More details about 
our plans to decrease our energy intensity in line with the 1.5c 
scenario decarbonisation pathway can be find on page 21. 
A detailed climate risk assessment was undertaken in recent years, 
focusing on the most apparent climate-related physical risks in 
the Netherlands (pluvial flooding, flooding, drought and heat) as 
well as taking socio-economic consequences and transitional risks 
(related to the transition to a low-carbon economy) into account.

It NSI’s ambition to reduce the actual energy intensity of 
all our buildings, in line with the aims of the Paris Agree-
ment. In 2022, NSI established a detailed plan (see page 
21 for more details), including an investment plan for each 
asset, including time line, to reach this target.
In two of its assets, HNK The Hague and Q-Port in Amsterdam, 
NSI has made big steps in 2022.
In HNK The Hague, cooling units have been replaced by heat pumps. Heating can now be done (partially) electrical, using green 
electricity, leading to significant reduction of gas usage (72%) and GHG emissions.

NSI aspires to be a great place to work. We want our people to 
enjoy the best work environment, excellent training, fulfilling 
and diverse career opportunities, and all the support they 
need to develop to their full potential.
NSI CULTURE AND MINDSET
NSI has an open and inclusive culture in which diversity is consi-
dered to be an added value. NSI aims to be a transparent, disci-
plined, responsible organisation that thinks in terms of oppor-
tunities. Furthermore, we like to keep it simple. We have clearly 
defined our core values, as can be found on page 53.
NSI incorporates these core values into its organ- isation and 
processes by hiring the best talent and by holding itself to the 
highest standards in an atmosphere of dedicated hard work, team 
spirit and fun.
NSI encourages its employees to give feedback and urges the 
whole organisation to actively contribute to our ambition of beco-
ming the leading Dutch real estate company.
Safeguarding our corporate culture has management’s ongoing 
attention and is consistently a significant point of attention in 
internal meetings. Our ability to live up to these core values is 
included in our assessment and appraisal methodology and 
discussed in regular and year-end reviews. Moreover, our core 
values are integrated in job descriptions and NSI has an onboar-
ding programme in place to familiarise new hires with the compa-
ny’s cultural values.
HEALTHY WORKPLACE
The health and well-being of our employees and tenants is also 
an element of an important pillar of NSI’s sustainability strategy. 
NSI’s efforts and ambitions in this respect are reported in more 
detail in the ESG chapter ‘The future is here’ (on page 14).
The sickness rate at NSI was stable at 3.5% in 2022 (2021: 3.5%). 
Sadly one of our colleagues passed away in 2022.
NSI’s culture and mindset, in which employees are used to having 
a great deal of flexibility with regard to how they perform their 
tasks and taking on responsibilities, is proving to be supportive in 
the health and well-being of our employees. 
NSI’s culture and its commitment to providing a healthy and 
inspiring working environment to its employees are reflected in

OUR VALUES
We believe that a clear set of values creates a common feeling 
of identity. Our values set out the common behaviours that 
support our purpose and define our culture:
WE ARE TRANSPARENT
We recognise that mutual trust can only really exist in an environ -
ment of openness, clear communication and consistent actions. Our 
success as a long-term investor hinges on us gaining and maintaining 
the trust of all stakeholders and we constantly focus on this.
WE ARE DISCIPLINED
Our internal and external procedures are befitting of a small and flex-
ible organisation. The procedures provide clarity on how we act and 
operate. We only make promises we can keep.
WE TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
Our intrinsic motivation at NSI is to always do the right thing. We recog-
nise and fully embrace the high level of responsibility that rests upon 
our shoulders as a publicly-listed company. As employees we are fully 
aware of the need to support our customers, colleagues and other 
stakeholders and we treat them with the utmost respect. We acknowl-
edge and correct any mistakes we make and we learn from them.
WE THINK IN TERMS OF OPPORTUNITIES
We have a positive mindset and are always seeking solutions and 
new opportunities. This makes us versatile and enables us to add 
value for our customers, whilst we continue to develop ourselves. We 
will always address the risks associated with an opportunity to come 
up with well-considered solutions. 
WE LIKE TO KEEP IT SIMPLE
Complexity often confuses, creates uncertainty, a fuzzy demarca-
tion of responsibilities and generally results in slowdowns and delays 
which in turn lead to inefficiency and high costs. We take decisions 
after thorough and substantiated deliberation, making sure our choice 
of structure, process and responsibilities are as clear and concise as 
possible for us and our stakeholders.
WE ARE HERE TO STAY
Our focus at NSI is on sustainability and the long term, both when it 
comes to the relationship with our customer, the perspective of the 
building, the location and the ever changing needs of users, and, but 
also with regard to the structure of our organisation and the interests 
of our shareholders. We are fully aware of short-term interests but will 
always favour the long term.

NSI’s head office; offering a modern, healthy, flexible interior that 
perfectly matches the experience we want to offer to our tenants,

A Leesman survey was conducted in 2022 to measure how 
supportive and effective the working environment in the new head 
office is experienced by all employees. The results were extremely 
good; the score was around 30% higher (Lmi of 83.2) compared 
to the average benchmark (64.4).  
EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT
Employee surveys are a strong tool used to track the actual and 
perceived well-being of employees, which is being conducted 
every two years. The latest survey ran in 2021 showed that 
employees generally feel engaged and connected, which was 
confirmed by a very high eNPS score (29.3). These surveys will be 
conducted again in 2023.
To keep employees informed and engaged, the Management 
Board regularly hosts sessions to inform the staff on the compa-
ny’s performance and to highlight specific topics and projects. 
These sessions are being held after each quarter to elaborate 
on the quarterly results, and every mid-quarter to discuss other 
subjects. In 2022, specific attention was paid to the macro-
economical and political environment and what this meant to NSI.
With a view to team building and knowledge sharing, NSI invited 
all employees for an inspirational trip to Stockholm in 2022. The 
program consisted of several presentations and property tours of 
leading property companies and property developers in Stock-
holm, combined with an informal program.
A ‘family and friends’ day was organised to present the new NSI 
head office. Pianist Aleksandr Zavyalov from Ukraine performed 
a concert during this day. After fleeing his country he is giving 
concerts to raise money for humanitarian aid in Ukraine. The foun-
dation “Get together for Ukraine” is sponsored by NSI.
TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
Each individual employee is expected to make, supported by HR 
and their manager,  a personal development plan, to guide trai-
ning needs and career perspectives.
NSI provides ample training and development opportunities for 
all our employees. Employees are encouraged to take exter-
nally recognised courses by granting annual individual training 
budgets.
In 2022 NSI started to offer all employees the possibility to 
strengthen their, mainly soft skills, by means of an online training 
platform. In total employees spent 73 hours on this platform in 
2022. This will be continued in 2023, and employees are being 
encouraged to further exploit the training opportunities and to 
increase the hours of training.
Throughout 2022 several awareness sessions related to sustain-
ability were organised for all employees to attend. Topics included 
Timber Construction and Biobased Materials. One of the aware-
ness trainings dealt with Cyber Security.
The training program that was specifically developed for the HNK 
team was implemented in 2022. The team was trained in how 
to embody the four defined and desired HNK experiences: I feel 
welcome, I feel connected, I feel truly supported, I feel energized. 
The entire team of NSI, including the Supervisory Board, was 
invited for a Profile Dynamics ® analysis. Profile Dynamics® 
provides insight into the values and drives of individuals in teams 
and organizations. Value systems largely determine people’s thin-
king and behavior. The analysis is a tool to assess if the profile 
match the type of work of an individual or (the composition of) a 
team, and can serve as starting point for coaching. NSI will use 
it to further develop teams into even more effective teams. The 
Profile Dynamics® tool will also be used as a reference point in 
future appointments.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
INTRODUCTION
In this section NSI sets out a broad outline of the company’s corpo-
rate governance and publishes detailed information about the matters 
specified in Article 10 section 1 a- k of the EU Takeover Directive.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE
As a public limited liability company in the Netherlands, NSI is subject 
to the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. The current (actualised) 
Code was published on December 20th, 2022. 
A detailed overview of the manner in which NSI complies with the 
provisions of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code and an expla-
nation why or where NSI derogates from best practice provisions is 
published on the company website. NSI complies with all best prac-
tice provisions of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, apart from 
best practice provision 1.3.1.
The following section gives a broad outline of the company’s corpo-
rate governance following the principles stated in the Dutch Corpo-
rate Governance Code.
OUTLINE OF NSI’S CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
NSI N.V. is a Dutch public limited liability company listed on Euronext 
Amsterdam and has its registered seat in Amsterdam, the Nether -
lands. NSI has a two-tier structure, with a Management Board and a 
non-executive Supervisory Board. The company’s highest authority 
is the General Meeting of Shareholders which is held at least once 
a year. 
1. LONG-TERM VALUE CREATION
1.1 LONG-TERM VALUE CREATION
The management board is responsible for the continuity of the 
company and its affiliated enterprise and for sustainable long-term 
value creation by the company and its affiliated enterprise. The 
management board takes into account the impact the actions of the 
company and its affiliated enterprise have on people and the envi-
ronment and to that end weighs the stakeholder interests that are 
relevant in this context. The supervisory board monitors the manage-
ment board in this regard.
In the management report, the management board gives a more 
detailed explanation of its view on sustainable long-term value crea-
tion and the strategy for its realisation, as well as describing which 
contributions were made to sustainable long-term value creation in 
the past financial year. 
1.2 RISK MANAGEMENT
The company has adequate internal risk management and control 
systems in place which are described in more detail in the chapter 
Risk management and control. The Management Board is respon-
sible for complying with relevant laws and regulations, for identifying 
and managing the risks associated with the company’s strategy and 
activities and for financing the company. 
The Management Board reports to the Supervisory Board and the 
General meeting of Shareholders.
1.3 INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION
The task of the internal audit function is to assess the design and the 
operation of the internal risk management and control systems. The 
management board is responsible for the internal audit function. The 
supervisory board oversees the internal audit function and maintains 
regular contact with the persons fulfilling this function.
As is the case with many small, listed companies in the Netherlands, NSI 
has no separate department for the internal auditor function as specified 
in best practice provision 1.3.1. The Supervisory Board assesses annu-
ally whether adequate alternative measures have been taken, partly 
on the basis of a recommendation issued by the audit committee and 
considers whether it is necessary to establish an internal audit depart-
ment and includes the conclusions, along with any resulting recom-
mendations and alternative measures, in the report of the Supervisory 
Board. In practice NSI has a comprehensive Internal Audit program 
and yearly executes several Internal Audits that are conducted by BDO 
accountants and reported to and discussed with the Audit committee. 
1.4 RISK MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTABILITY
The management board discusses the effectiveness of the design and 
operation of the internal risk management and control systems with the 
Audit committee and renders account of this to the supervisory board.
1.5 ROLE OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
The primary duty of the Supervisory Board is to supervise the manage-
ment exercised by the Management Board and the general develop-
ments at the company and its affiliated enterprise, as well as to advise 
the Management Board. In the performance of its duties, the Super-
visory Board focuses on the interests of the company and its affili-
ated enterprise and on the effectiveness of the company’s internal risk 
management and control systems and the integrity and quality of the 
financial reporting. 
1.6 APPOINTMENT AND ASSESSMENT OF THE FUNCTIONING OF 
THE INDEPENDENT EXTERNAL AUDITOR
The independent external auditor is appointed by the General Meeting 
of Shareholders and attends the meeting of the Supervisory Board at 
which the financial statements are discussed and adopted in the pres-
ence of the Management Board. NSI publishes audited annual figures 
and reviewed semi-annual figures. NSI publishes a trading update for 
the first and third quarters, neither of which is reviewed or audited by 
the independent external auditor. PricewaterhouseCoopers Account-
ants N.V. was appointed as NSI’s independent external auditor in 2016.
1.7 PERFORMANCE OF THE INDEPENDENT  
EXTERNAL AUDITOR’S WORK
The audit committee and the independent external auditor discuss 
the audit plan and the findings of the independent external auditor 
based on the work the independent external auditor has undertaken. 
The management board and the supervisory board maintain regular 
contact with the independent external auditor.
2. EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION
2.0 DIVERSITY
The diversity policy for the composition of the management board 
aims at a balanced gender breakdown. With a management board 
25 | NSI SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022
NSI AT A GLANCE VALUE CREATION ESG PEOPLE GOVERNANCE ESG PERFORMANCE MEASURES EU TAXONOMY

Page 26:
that was 50% female and 50% male in the past financial year this 
policy is fully implemented. 
The diversity policy for the composition of the Supervisory Board 
aims at a supervisory board that is at least 33,3% female and 
33,3% male. With a supervisory board that was 40% female and 
60% male in the past financial year this policy is fully implemented. 
The diversity policy for the composition of the Supervisory Board 
is included in the profile of the Supervisory Board which specifies 
the size, diversity and independence of the board and the desired 
expertise and background of the Supervisory Board members 
and which competencies should be represented in the Board. The 
profile is published on the company’s website. The Supervisory 
Board strives to achieve a situation in which the experience and 
expertise of its members are appropriate in relation to the strategy 
and business activities of NSI, and cover specific areas of exper-
tise, like financial management, sustainability and IT. The experi-
ence and expertise of the individual Supervisory Board members is 
detailed on page 81 and 82 of this annual report.
2.1 MANAGEMENT BOARD COMPOSITION, SIZE AND DIVISION 
OF DUTIES 
The Management Board consists of two directors: a CEO and a CFO. 
Directors are appointed by the General Meeting. 
The procedure for appointment and reappointment is specified in 
section (h) below.
The division of duties within the Management Board as well as the 
Board’s operating procedures are set out in the Articles of Associa-
tion and the Management Board regulations which are made avail-
able on the company’s website. The functioning of the Management 
Board as a collective and the functioning of individual members is 
evaluated yearly.
2.2 SUPERVISORY BOARD COMPOSITION AND SIZE
In accordance with the company’s Articles of Association, the 
Supervisory Board consists of at least three members. Members 
are appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders. The Super-
visory Board currently comprises five members. The procedure for 
appointment and reappointment is specified in section (h) below.
The Supervisory Board is composed in such a way that its members 
can operate independently and critically with regard to each other, 
the Management Board and any interest group. All Supervisory 
Board members are currently independent within the meaning of 
best practice provision 2.1.8 of the Dutch Corporate Governance 
Code. A supervisory director is considered to be independent if 
the dependence criteria stated in the Code do not apply. One of 
the members of the Supervisory Board is a shareholder in ICAMAP 
Investments SARL, which is holding over 10% of NSI shares as 
per 31 December 2022. This company has invested in NSI with a 
view to a long-term commitment and the respective Supervisory 
Board member actively ensures that no transactions in NSI shares 
take place during the closed periods and during periods when the 
member of the Supervisory Board has inside information at its 
disposal which has not yet been made public by the company.
2.3 SUPERVISORY BOARD ORGANISATION AND DIVISION OF 
DUTIES 
The division of duties within the Supervisory Board as well as its 
operating procedures are laid down in the company’s Articles 
of Association and the Supervisory Board regulations, both of 
which are made available on the company’s website. The Super-
visory Board has appointed an Audit Committee, a Remuneration 
Committee, a Selection and Appointment Committee, and a Real 
Estate Committee from within its ranks. The regulations of these 
committees can also be accessed via the website.
2.4 DECISION-MAKING AND FUNCTIONING
In its monitoring, the Supervisory Board focuses on the strategy 
for realizing sustainable long-term value creation which has been 
established for this purpose, as well as on the targets derived from 
this strategy. The Supervisory Board also monitors the process 
of acquiring, divesting, and investing in real estate, the financial 
reporting process, and compliance with laws and regulations.  
The Supervisory Board monitors the internal control structure and 
procedures and the assessment of the risks faced by the company 
and its subsidiaries. During 2022 the systems and procedures func-
tioned in accordance with their intended purpose and there were no 
issues that raised doubt as to whether the internal control structure 
and procedures functioned adequately.
The Supervisory Board reports to the General meeting of  
Shareholders.
The functioning of the Supervisory Board as a collective and the 
functioning of individual members is evaluated yearly.
2.5 CULTURE 
NSI has a mature, open culture that encourages employees to speak 
up. The culture is aimed at sustainable long-term value creation for 
the company and its affiliated enterprise.
The NSI Code of Conduct outlines the core values, the main integ-
rity risks NSI may encounter in its business and the way it wishes 
to deal with these risks. The Code of conduct is published on the 
company’s website. 
2.6 COMPLIANCE
The Code of Conduct contains a procedure for reporting actual or 
suspicion of misconduct or irregularities. The management board 
monitors the effectiveness and compliance with the Code and 
reports about this in every meeting with the Audit Committee. 
2.7 PREVENTING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
In accordance with its regulations, the Supervisory Board is 
responsible for decision-making in dealing with existing or poten-
tial conflicts of interest between Management Board members, 
Supervisory Board members and the 
independent external auditor, 
on the one hand, and the company, on the other. Under the provi-
sions of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel 
toezicht or Wft) and EU-IFRS, the item ‘related parties’ in the annual 
financial statements specifies transactions between the company 
and related parties, including members of the Management Board 
26 | NSI SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022
NSI AT A GLANCE VALUE CREATION ESG PEOPLE GOVERNANCE ESG PERFORMANCE MEASURES EU TAXONOMY

Page 27:
and the Supervisory Board, as well as transactions involving one 
or more related parties. The item also states to what extent such 
transactions were entered into at market conditions. No such trans-
actions between the company and related parties took place in the 
2022 financial year.
3. REMUNERATION
3.1 REMUNERATION POLICY – MANAGEMENT BOARD
The General Meeting determines the remuneration policy for the 
Management Board, in accordance with the relevant statutory 
provisions. The Supervisory Board makes a proposal to that end. 
The remuneration policy focusses on sustainable long-term value 
creation for the company and its affiliated enterprise and takes into 
account the internal pay ratios within the enterprise. The ‘Remu-
neration Policy for Members of the Management Board of NSI’ is 
published on the website.
3.2 DETERMINATION OF MANAGEMENT BOARD REMUNERATION
The Supervisory Board establishes the remuneration and other 
terms of service for members of the Management Board in accord-
ance with the remuneration policy for the Management Board.
3.3 REMUNERATION – SUPERVISORY BOARD
The Supervisory Board members receive a remuneration in accord-
ance with the ‘Remuneration Policy for Members of the Supervisory 
Board of NSI’ which is published on the company’s website. The 
General Meeting determines the remuneration policy for the Super-
visory Board, in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions. 
3.4 ACCOUNTABILITY FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF REMUNERA-
TION POLICY
In the remuneration report, the Supervisory Board renders account 
of the implementation of the remuneration policy. The report is 
posted on the company’s website.
4. THE GENERAL MEETING
At least one General Meeting is held every year within six months of 
the end of the company’s financial year. General Meetings of Share-
holders are convened by the Management Board or the Supervisory 
Board. A legal term of at least 42 days applies between the convo-
cation date of a General Meeting of Shareholders and the actual 
date of the meeting. The agenda of the general meeting shall list 
which items are up for discussion and which items are to be voted 
on. Listed items that are mentioned in best practice provision 4.1.3 
of the Governance Code shall be dealt with as separate agenda 
items. The topics mentioned in article 23 section 3 of the Articles of 
Association are discussed when applicable.
Extraordinary General Meetings are held as often as the Manage-
ment Board or the Supervisory Board deems necessary. Extraordi-
nary General Meetings will also be held if the Management Board or 
the Supervisory Board is requested to that effect in writing by one or 
more holders of shares individually or jointly representing one-tenth 
or more of the issued capital, specifying in detail the subjects to be 
discussed.
The 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders took place on

h  the rules governing the appointment and replacement of board 
members and the amendment of the articles of association;
Appointment and replacement of management board members
The company is managed by a Management Board consisting of 
two members. 
The General Meeting shall appoint and dismiss the members of the 
Management Board. Each member of the Management Board will 
be appointed for a term of not more than four (4) years, and shall be 
eligible for re-election. 
The General Meeting may suspend or dismiss a member of the 
Management Board at any time, providing the resolution to that ef-
fect is passed with a majority of at least two thirds of the votes cast 
that also represents more than half of the issued capital. 
The Supervisory Board shall be authorised to suspend any member 
of the Management Board at any time. 
Appointment and replacement of supervisory board members
The members of the Supervisory Board shall be appointed by the 
General Meeting. A supervisory board member is appointed for a 
period of four years and may then be reappointed once for another 
four-year period. The supervisory board member may then be reap-
pointed again for a period of two years, which appointment may be 
extended by at most two years.
At the General Meeting only candidates whose names are stated 
on the agenda of the meeting can be voted on for appointment as 
member of the Supervisory Board. 
Each member of the Supervisory Board can at all times be 
suspended or removed from office by the General Meeting. A reso-
lution to suspend or remove a member of the Supervisory Board 
requires a majority of two thirds of the votes cast, representing more 
than one half of the issued capital of the company.
Amendment of the articles of association
If a proposal to amend the Articles of Association is put to the Gen-
eral Meeting, that proposal shall always be stated in the notice con-
vening the General Meeting. 
The shareholders shall be given the opportunity to obtain a copy of 
the proposal, from the day when the proposal is filed at the com-
pany’s offices until the day of the General Meeting. These copies 
shall be provided free of charge.

passed by a simple majority of the votes cast at a General Meeting. 
i The powers of board members, and in particular the power to 
issue or buy back shares

in accordance with the law and the articles of association which 
may require the management board to obtain prior approval of 
the general meeting or of the Supervisory Board before making a

ESG – GOVERNANCE
The oversight of ESG matters is crucial. ESG is overseen princi-
pally by the Management Board. 
The strategy and targets for energy consumption and carbon emis-
sions are set and monitored by the Management Board. The respon-
sibility for overseeing day-to-day management is delegated to the 
management team. NSI has formed a dedicated ESG committee 
who meets twice a month to address targets, implementation and 
reporting of our ESG objectives. We have created an ESG coordi-
nator role which is entrusted to the Investor Relations officer. Both 
members of the Management Board are part of this committee as 
well as key personnel from different disciplines in (technical) asset 
management, finance and reporting.
For 2022 the focus of the ESG committee was:
–  Sharpen ESG strategy and pillars, monitor progress and improve 
where necessary
–  Establish roadmap to a Paris aligned portfolio on an asset and 
portfolio level
– Define the non-financial KPI’s 
– ESG accounting manual
– ESG data collection and warehousing
– EU taxonomy analysis and implementation
– Organising internal awareness and knowledge sessions
ALIGNMENT OF PERFORMANCE TARGETS
DISCLOSURE AND REPORTING
Progress on sustainability is disclosed to all stakeholders in the 
Annual Report and online in our sustainability report. NSI’s non-
financial performance is reported and communicated considering 
the following standards and benchmarking tools:
– GHG Protocol Corporate Standard
– GRI Standards
– EPRA
– GRESB methodology
– CRREM
– EU Taxonomy methodology
NSI aims to continuously improve its internal ESG governance. For 
this purpose NSI started the ISO14001 certification process. This 
standard will help NSI implement a holistic environmental manage-
ment system and improve its general sustainability performance.
ESG ASSURANCE
NSI’s independent auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V . 
has provided limited assurance on a selection of  reported sustain-
ability and non- financial KPIs for financial year 2022. In scope 
are 18 KPI’s in the field of Energy, Water, Waste, Greenhouse Gas 
Emissions, Certification and Social (full list outlined in the glossary 
on page 152-153) and the green financing agreement. This limited 
assurance is an intermediate step in the transition to an integrated 
annual report, in which the full sustainability information will be in 
scope in line with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive 
(CSRD), which will come into effect for NSI on 1 January 2025. 
NSI has performed a CSRD gap analysis and will continue with the 
implementation of CSRD in 2023, which is expected to become 
applicable to NSI in 2025.
OTHER NON-FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
NSI is committed to fostering a fair and inclusive working environ -
ment. NSI aims to foster a culture where people are respected and 
appreciated, and perceive equality and fairness of opportunities in 
their workplace. NSI recognises the benefits of diversity and inclu-
sion, and is fully committed to providing equal opportunities and 
treatment when it comes to recruitment and selection, training and 
development, performance reviews and promotion. Our culture is 
based on the principles of mutual respect and non-discrimination 
irrespective of nationality, age, disability, gender, religion or sexual 
orientation.
NSI aims for a balanced gender distribution and is committed to 
provide equal pay for equal work. The current gender pay gap 
ratio is largely driven by the structure of our workforce, including 
the higher representation of men in senior management roles and 
a higher representation of women in operations (HNK hosts), vari-
eties in tenure, job level and specific expertise. NSI aims to improve 
the gender balance at all levels of the organisation, and the related 
gender pay ratio, and explicitly takes this into account when filling 
vacancies.
Personal and corporate sustainability targets are embedded into 
the annual performance goals of each employee at NSI. The 
Management Board also have annual performance ESG goals.
NSI also encourages employees to contribute and share knowl-
edge through specific knowledge sharing events. This is done 
predominately through the Sustainability Committee who take 
ESG responsibility for each of NSI’s commitments.

COGNITIVE DIVERSITY
NSI welcomes diverse talents and is keen on including multiple 
perspectives, thereby leveraging inclusion on a cognitive level. 
NSI strongly believes that collaboration between people with 
different thinking styles, habits and perspectives brings about 
better results. In 2022, NSI measured how different perspectives, 
competences and value systems are represented in the organiza-
tion by using the ‘Profile Dynamics’ methodology. This provided 
insight into whether the profile and composition of a team reflect 
the desired balance in terms of cognitive diversity and inclusion. 
The Profile Dynamics® tool will also be used as a reference point 
in future appointments.

HUMAN RIGHTS
NSI supports the principles laid down in the Organisation for 
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for 
Multinational Enterprises. We believe that human rights, as defined 
by the United Nations in its Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
are a common standard that all employers should uphold, and we 
encourage our employees as well as our contractors and suppliers to 
respect these rights by committing to our Code of Conduct and busi-
ness integrity principles as part of our general terms and conditions.
No issues involving human rights were reported in 2022.
ANTI-CORRUPTION
NSI and its employees must act with integrity, honesty and in compli-
ance with the laws, as stipulated in the company’s Code of Conduct. 
The Code of Conduct also defines how employees should act when 
presented with gifts and provides guidance on how to prevent 
conflicts of interest. The code of conduct also provides a protocol on 
how to act in case of undesirable behaviour.
The Code of Conduct is available on the company website. The 
code of conduct is signed annually by NSI employees. In 2022 NSI 
contracted an external counselor as part of its whistle-blower proce-
dure, allowing employees to report suspected irregularities of various 
kinds within NSI without jeopardising their position. There were no 
issues reported in 2022.

MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY AND ASSUMPTIONS 
ESG (NON-FINANCIAL) PERFORMANCE MEASURES 
NSI reports environmental, social and governance performance in 
accordance with the EPRA Sustainability Best Practice Recom-
mendations (sBPR). This reporting is split into several sections 
consisting of the overarching EPRA recommendations, the envi-
ronmental performance indicators, the social performance indica-
tors and the governance performance indicators. 
REPORTING PERIOD AND ORGANISATIONAL BOUNDARIES 
The reporting period for this report is the same as for the annual 
ﬁ  nancial report. NSI includes its ESG performance in its annual 
report since 2017, and publishes a separate sustainability report 
since 2020. The analysis includes data of the portfolio as per 31 
December 2022. Assets that were acquired or disposed during 
2022 were excluded from the Like-for-like performance analysis. 
MEASUREMENT SCOPE AND COVERAGE 
In 2022, 100% of the total portfolio value belonged to the measure-
ment scope, which corresponds to 51 properties, including the 
NSI head ofﬁ  ce. The consumption data were collected using our 
invoice data, invoice data obtained from tenants, combined with 
smart meters and data obtained from tenants. In the event of 
incomplete or missing data, the data was extrapolated in accor-
dance with EPRA guidelines or the asset was excluded. 
With regard to the measurement of electricity, the following apply: 
–   The energy generated by the solar panels has not been deducted 
from the total electricity consumption 
–   The consumption of the electric charging stations is excluded in 
the total electricity consumption.
–   The electricity consumption of the tenant is based on renewable 
energy. The calculation of the ‘building energy intensity’ is based 
on all buildings for which data is available for at least 9 months. In 
case of missing data, the data is extrapolated to a whole year. On 
page 137 to 140 you can ﬁ  nd the EPRA tables with the various 
performances, including the share of buildings in scope for each 
of the performance indicators and the extent of data coverage/ 
extrapolation. 
ESTIMATION AND EXTRAPOLATION OF CONSUMPTION DATA 
At the time of publication of this report, not all data are available 
for the measurement year 2022 yet. If data for at least ten months 
is available, it has been extrapolated in accordance with EPRA 
guidelines. If the data of one of the meters in a building is missing, 
the square meters of the building will be adjusted pro-rata for 
the purpose of determining the energy- , CO 2 - and water inten-
sity and calculating the data coverage. The 2021 consumption 
ﬁ  gures were adjusted compared to the previously reported and 
audited ﬁ  gures as a result of the ﬁ  nal invoices and measurements. 
In accordance with the EPRA guidelines, a like for like analysis 
was carried out for several environmental indicators. The analysis 
enables NSI to observe evolutions in consumption, irrespective of 
the fact that new assets are added to the scope of measurement. 
EXPLANATORY NOTES TO SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE 
MEASURES 
The like for like (LfL) calculation reﬂ  ects consumption of the 
portfolio that has been consistently in operation during the most 
recent two full reporting years, in line with the EPRA sBPR deﬁ  ni-
tion. As a result, neither the purchased assets nor the assets sold 
in the reporting period are included in this calculation. 
This means that: 
–  7 assets are excluded from Like-for-Like Performance as these 
assets were not fully operational during the reporting period of 
2022. 
–  4 assets are excluded from Like-for-Like Performance as these 
assets were purchased during the reporting period of 2021. 
Furthermore, the Notes in the table refer to the following: 
A  Square meters based on CRREM methodology (Gross ﬂ  oor 
area minus internal parking garage minus outer façade).
 
B  Normalization (as a consequence of Acquisitions and Disposi-
tions during the year): 
–  When a property is in the portfolio for less than 9 months (< 274 
days), the property will be excluded. 
–  When a property is in the portfolio for 9 months or longer (=> 
274 days), the property will be included. For these properties, 
the consumption for the remaining part of the year should be 
estimated/extrapolated and explained in the report.
C  Reported consumption changes compared with last year due 
to additional data availability. This results in a higher data 
coverage. 
D  Data of last year was not accurate due to a double counting. 
This is corrected.

NSI reports on the following KPI’s:
–  Total amount of district heating and cooling consumption, split by 
Landlord obtained and Tenant obtained heating and cooling; 
–  The proportion of the total consumption that is from renewable 
resources (calculated as percentage of total annual kWh).
Both absolute ﬁ  gures as well as a like-for-like comparison with the 
prior reporting period are reported.
ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION
The electricity consumed during a reporting period. It includes elec-
tricity from renewable and non-renewable sources, whether imported 
or generated on site. This includes the electricity consumed by the 
EV-charging stations. 
NSI reports on the following KPI’s:
–  Total amount of electricity consumption, split by Landlord (Scope 
2) obtained and Tenant (Scope 3) obtained electricity; 
–  The proportion of the total consumption obtained by Landlord from 
renewable resources.
Both absolute ﬁ  gures as well as a like-for-like comparison with the 
prior reporting period are reported.
EMPLOYEES
Individuals that are in an employment agreement with NSI, according 
to national law or its application (i.e. employees). Employees exclude 
temporary staff (not on payroll NSI) 
EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND SAFETY
The occupational health and safety performance of the organisation 
with relation to its employees. 
NSI reports on the following KPI’s:
–  Absentee rate: actual absentee days lost due to illness as a 
percentage of total number of days scheduled to be worked by all 
employees; 
–  Injury rate: the frequency of injuries relative to the total time 
worked by all employees during the reporting period;
–    Work related fatalities: this refers to the number of death of 
employees during the reporting period while performing work for 
the organisation
EMPLOYEE TURNOVER AND RETENTION
The total number and rate of new employee hires and employee 
turnover during the reporting period.
EMPLOYEE TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
The average hours of (external) training, paid for by NSI, that the orga-
nisation’s employees have undertaken in the reporting period based 
on the average hours prescribed for the training as indicated by the 
training provider divided by the average number of employees (head-
count) during the reporting period.
ENERGY INTENSITY
The total energy used by renewable and non-renewable resources 
during a reporting period, normalised by the sum of the gross ﬂ  oor 
area in square meters for the properties in scope.
Both absolute ﬁ  gures as well as a like-for-like comparison with the 
prior reporting period are reported.
ENERGY INTENSITY (CRREM) 
The total energy used by renewable and non-renewable resources 
during a reporting period, normalised by the sum of the CRREM ﬂ  oor 
area in square meters (gross ﬂ  oor area minus parking garages and 
outer façade) for the properties in scope.
FUEL CONSUMPTION
The fuel used from direct (renewable and non-renewable) resources 
(direct meaning that the fuel is combusted on site) over a reporting 
period.
NSI reports on the following KPI’s:
–  Total amount of fuel used from direct resources, split in Landlord 
obtained and Tenant obtained fuels; 
–  The proportion of the total consumption that is from renewable 
resources.
Both absolute ﬁ  gures as well as a like-for-like comparison with the 
prior reporting period are reported.

GENDER DIVERSITY
The percentage of male and female employees in the organisation as 
per reporting date based on the headcount.
GENDER PAY RATIO
The ratio of the basic annual salary or remuneration, including vari-
able components, of male to female, taking into account the full-time 
employee equivalent.
GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) DIRECT EMISSIONS (SCOPE 1)
The total amount of Landlord induced direct greenhouse gas emis-
sions generated during a reporting period. 
“Direct” refers to GHG-emissions that are generated on site through 
combustion of the energy source. 
Both absolute ﬁ  gures as well as a like-for-like comparison with the 
prior reporting period are reported.
GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) INDIRECT EMISSIONS 
(SCOPE 2)
The total amount of Landlord induced indirect greenhouse gas emis-
sions generated during a reporting period.
 
“Indirect” refers to GHG-emissions that are not generated on site 
through combustion of the energy source, but refers to GHG-emis-
sions induced off site. This includes the GHG-emissions caused by 
“District heating and cooling” and/or consumption of “Non-renewable 
electricity”.  
Both absolute ﬁ  gures as well as a like-for-like comparison with the
