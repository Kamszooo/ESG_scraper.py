About this report
INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT
Our Integrated Annual Report 2022 (IAR) provides
information on the bank's financial and non-
financial performance in compliance with statutory
requirements. It sets out how we dealt with
opportunities and risks in 2022 and how we created
value for our customers, society, our employees and
our shareholder. Anticipating upcoming regulations,
we have opted for an integrated approach for our IAR
2022, in which we have merged our statutory annual
report with our Integrated Annual Review which was
previously separate.
This IAR 2022 consists of:
• The Report of the Executive Board, including:
- Introduction
- Operating environment, strategy and performance
- Sustainability statements
- Governance (excluding the Report of the
Supervisory Board)
- Risk management
• The Report of the Supervisory Board (included in
chapter Governance)
• Financial statements
• Other information and Additional information
In addition, to the IAR, we publish the following reports
for 2022, which should be seen as stand-alone reports:
• Annual Review 2022 which includes a summary
of our most important financial and social results
for the past year. The Annual Review is intended
for a wide audience and is also available in Dutch
(Jaaroverzicht 2022).
• Pillar 3 Report 2022 containing the mandatory
reporting on capital requirements and risk
management ensuing from the European Capital
Requirements Regulation (CRR).
Our IAR 2022 is our primary statutory and regulatory
reporting disclosure.
The financial information in the financial statements
has been prepared in accordance with the
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as
adopted by the European Union (EU IFRS).
Moreover, the financial information meets the
requirements as set out in Title 9, Book 2 of the Dutch
Civil Code.
Capital metrics and risk positions for 2022 and
comparative figures for 2021 are reported under the
Basel III framework (CRD IV/CRR). Information on Pillar
3 (part of the CRR) can be found in a separate report
on our website.
The non-financial information in the Report of the
Executive Board has been prepared in accordance
with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards,
the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) and with
consideration of the Task Force on Climate-Related
Financial Disclosures (TCFD). We are also committed
to the UN Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB).
More information on this can be found in Section Our
approach to reporting.
This IAR 2022 is available in English only. Our financial
reporting currency is the euro (€). Throughout this
report, the material topics are identifiable by MT icons
and our key performance indicators by KPI icons.
Adjusted measures
We supplement our IFRS figures with non-IFRS
measures used by management internally that
constitute alternative performance measures under
European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)
guidance and non-GAAP financial measures. Further
explanation may be found in Section 1.4.3
Reconciliation of alternative performance measures.
European Single Electronic Reporting Format (ESEF)
The PDF/printed version of the Integrated Annual
Report 2022 of de Volksbank has been prepared
for ease of use. The PDF/printed version is not
the official Integrated Annual Report 2022, including
the audited financial statements thereto pursuant
to article 361 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
The official Integrated Annual Report 2022 was
made publicly available pursuant to section 5:25c
of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het
financieel toezicht), and was filed with the Netherlands
Authority for the Financial Markets in European Single
Electronic Reporting Format (the ESEF package). The
ESEF package is available on our website. In case of
discrepancies between this PDF version and the ESEF
package, the latter prevails.

8 de Volksbank N.V. Integrated Annual Report 2022
Foreword from the CEO
Martijn Gribnau, Chair of the Executive Committee of
de Volksbank
''In 2022, we faced major changes in the world around
us. The year started on a positive note with the lifting
of the Covid-related European lockdown measures.
However, at the end of February, Russia invaded
Ukraine. First and foremost, our thoughts go out to
the people of Ukraine, who are fighting for their
independence, and to all those who are affected by the
war.
The Russia-Ukraine war sent energy prices sky
high, fuelling inflation and inflation expectations.
In response, the European Central Bank began to
increase its deposit rates. In the second half of 2022,
the ECB deposit facility rate, which had been fixed
at -0.5% since 2019, was increased to 2.0% in four
successive steps. Market interest rates also showed
a sharp increase: in the Netherlands, mortgage rates
tripled compared to year-end 2021. At the same
time, the rising house price trend came to an
end, while economic growth slowed down. All these
factors negatively affected the financial position and
purchasing power of consumers.
In 2022, we focussed on the implementation of our
strategy for the period 2021-2025, entitled ‘Better for
each other – from promise to impact’. For the bank
as a whole, we have set ourselves two major strategic
goals. Our first goal for 2025 is to be the bank with the
strongest customer relationship in the Netherlands,
and our second goal is to have a substantial and
measurable positive impact on society.
Our brands continued to resonate positively with
customers and the number of active multi-customers
increased by 7% to 1.1 million, on track for our
ambition of 1.3 million by 2025. In May 2022, in
a survey conducted by market research company
MarketResponse, RegioBank was again awarded
the title of ‘most customer-friendly bank’ in the
Netherlands, with SNS and ASN Bank in second and
third place. Still, the average Net Promoter Score of
our brands declined to -1, from 6 at year-end 2021,
impacted by the introduction of a fixed fee for the
basic banking package.
Throughout the year, we continued to strengthen the
relationship with our customers by actively engaging
with them through our digital bank channels and,
in the case of SNS and RegioBank, through our
network of shops and branches. Examples of customer
engagement in 2022 include the fourth edition of
the SNS Youth Board in Utrecht, to discuss the
importance of equal access to financial knowledge
and information. BLG Wonen held its annual Housing
Debate in Rotterdam, focussed on corporates and
ideas to make the housing market more accessible
and sustainable. In June, RegioBank organised its
second national ‘Village Summit’ in Goirle for everyone
involved in regional developments and initiatives. In
December, ASN Bank hosted a meeting in Leiden
for 250 investors to discuss sustainable investment
opportunities.
Our primary aim is and remains to assist customers
in fulfilling their financing needs and to contribute to
their financial resilience, with each brand focussing
specifically on different customer needs. In April, we
rolled out Apple Pay for SNS, ASN Bank and RegioBank
customers. In cooperation with the Dutch National
Mortgage Guarantee, BLG Wonen prolonged a pilot
aimed at making mortgages accessible to high-rent
tenants (Duurhuur). By the end of 2022 we had
provided nearly 500 of these mortgages.
As a frontrunner in creating social impact, we further
improved our ecological footprint. Our climate-neutral
balance sheet increased by 7 percentage points to
62%, well on track to reach our objective of being 75%
climate neutral by 2025. At the end of the year we
published our first Climate Action Plan, outlining our
goal to achieve a net zero balance sheet by 2050, or
sooner if possible.
To achieve our strategic goals, we are executing
a number of change movements and making
investments, ensuring more robust and efficient
business operations. An important element was the
transition to a new way of working based on agile
principles in March.
Despite the internal organisational changes, the KPI
score for ‘genuine attention for employees’ remained
high at 7.6, a limited decline compared to the score
of 7.8 in 2021, but still above our objective of at least
7.5. I am pleased that we reached a new collective
labour agreement at the end of 2022. In addition to

an agreement on wages for the next two years, we are
committing ourselves to improvements with respect to
diversity and inclusion.
The Executive Committee was established on 16 May
2022. On 1 April, we announced the appointment of
Marjolein de Jongh as Chief Transformation Officer
and of Michel Ruijterman as Chief Information Officer,
followed by the appointment of André Haag as Chief
Financial Officer with effect from 1 August. Finally,
with effect from 15 October, Jacqueline Touw was
appointed as Chief People & Organisation Officer.
With this appointment, all vacancies on the Executive
Committee were filled.
Taking into account the changing economic and
interest rate environment, we continued to make
commercial and financial progress in 2022.
Our residential mortgage portfolio grew by € 1.1 billion
to € 48.3 billion and SME loans by € 255 million to
€ 1.1 billion. Retail savings decreased by € 1.1 billion to
€ 44.5 billion, impacted by an outflow of mono savings
customers following the introduction of a fixed fee for
the basic banking package. And, as a result of falling
stock markets, assets under management decreased
by € 0.8 billion to € 3.9 billion.
Net profit rose by € 29 million to € 191 million, as
higher total income and lower operating expenses
were partly offset by a swing in impairments. Return
on Equity improved to 5.2%, compared to 4.7% in 2021,
well on track to achieve our objective of 8% for 2025.
Total income increased by 17% to € 965 million,
benefitting from higher ECB interest rates. Net interest
income rose 10% to € 851 million. Net fee and
commission income was up 31% to € 51 million,
mainly driven by higher mortgage advisory fees and
fees for the basic banking package. Other income was
exceptionally high at € 63 million, € 50 million higher
than in 2021. This increase was mainly driven by a
€ 46 million gain on swaptions, used to hedge our
bank's long-term interest income against sharply rising
market interest rates.
Total operating expenses decreased by 2% to
€ 655 million, corresponding with a cost/income ratio
of 67.9% (2021: 80.7%). This decline was mainly driven
by lower regulatory levies. In both 2021 and 2022,
operating expenses included a positive incidental item.
In 2021 there had been a € 22 million revaluation of a
previous contribution related to the insolvency of DSB.
In 2022 we released part of the ‘agile’ restructuring
provision formed in 2020. This release, in the amount
of € 23 million, was driven by changing assumptions,
such as fewer redundancies as a result of re-employing
more staff for regulatory and compliance-related
topics.
Total impairment charges rose to € 52 million, a
swing of € 110 million compared to the € 58 million
reversal in 2021. The higher impairments were mainly
driven by deteriorated macroeconomic parameters
used in our loan loss provisioning models. The actual
incurred losses of residential mortgages and SME
loans remained at a very low level, evidencing the high
underlying credit quality.
Our CET1 capital ratio showed a decrease to 20.3%,
from 22.7% at year-end 2021. This decline was mainly
attributable to an increase in risk-weighted assets,
driven by increased exposures to financial institutions
and corporates to optimise the return on excess
liquidity.
In order to strengthen and diversify our capital
position, we issued € 500 million of senior non-
preferred (SNP) notes in April 2022, followed by the
issuance of € 300 million of green Additional Tier 1
notes in June. Despite this last issuance, the leverage
ratio decreased from 5.1% to 4.7% as the temporary
relief measure from the ECB lapsed with effect from
April 2022. Nonetheless, our capital position remained
strong and in October S&P upgraded our credit rating
by one notch to A.
Because of the changed interest rate environment, the
prospect of a positive development of total income has
improved. Yet, wage growth and the need to invest
in projects to further improve IT systems and meet
additional regulatory requirements will also cause an
increase in operating expenses. A further downturn
in the Dutch housing market may require additional
provisioning. All in all, we expect a higher net profit for
2023.
On 22 February 2023, the Dutch Minister of Finance
wrote to the House of Representatives that, in order to
avoid unnecessary delay and provide timely clarity to
de Volksbank, she intends to take a directional decision
about the future of our bank before the end of 2023.
Our shareholder NLFI and de Volksbank will be actively
involved in the process towards this decision. We
think that this is a good moment to further explore
the future options for our bank and appreciate that,
together with NLFI, we can actively participate in this
process. A final choice on our future can only be made
when NLFI has determined that the bank is ready for it.
In the first two years of the strategic period 2021-2025
we focussed on increasing our multi-customer base,
increasing fee income and changing our organisation
towards a more agile way of working, as well as
on installing a new leadership team. Making our
operations more robust is a necessary condition
for creating the impact we want to make, both at
customer and social level. In the years to come, the
challenge is to increasingly move from ‘promise’ to
‘impact’, while making additional investments in IT
systems, data quality and programmes to improve
our KYC operations. We attach great importance to
our gatekeeper function by having adequate customer
integrity policies and controls in place and by meeting
all regulatory requirements. I am confident that we will
succeed in executing our strategy and would like to
thank our customers for their trust in our bank and
our employees for their hard work aimed at providing
excellent services to all our stakeholders.''

1.1 Our operating environment
1.1.1 Economic developments
Dutch economy
The lifting of the various Covid-19 containment
measures led to a revival of economic activities in
the first half of 2022. Later, the situation reversed
as the tailwind from the reopening of the economy
faded, but above all because Russia’s invasion of
Ukraine caused a surge in energy and food prices.
Natural gas on the Dutch TTF trading point reached
a peak of € 343 per MWh in August and averaged
€ 132 per MWh over the full year, up from € 47
per MWh in 2021, a development that gradually
filtered through to gas prices for households and
strongly affected consumer sentiment. The latter
caused consumer spending to fall in the summer
and it remained subdued for the remainder of the
year. The corporate sector was confronted with higher
input costs, undermining profitability and suppressing
business sentiment. A slowdown in world trade growth
also had a detrimental effect, in particular for the
manufacturing industry. Inflation peaked at 14.5%
in September, with an annual average percentage
of 10.0%, up from 2.7% in 2021. Nevertheless, the
performance of the Dutch economy still compared
favourably to that of most other European countries.
Unemployment continued to decrease initially, falling
to a record low of 3.2% of the labour force in April.
The subsequent rise did not persist in the last part of
the year and, overall, the labour market remained very
tight. The annual average unemployment rate declined
by 0.7 percentage points to 3.5%.
Interest rates and government bond yields
As inflation turned out to be more persistent than
initially expected, the European Central Bank (ECB)
began to prepare the market for a policy of monetary
tightening as from March 2022. The tightening cycle
was put into effect by discontinuing the Asset Purchase
Programme as from 1 July, as well as by four rate hikes
in July, September, October and December, bringing
the deposit rate to 2.0%, up from -0.5% at year-end
2021. These hikes, coupled with increasingly ‘hawkish’
rhetoric on further policy moves, pushed bond yields
higher. The shorter end of the yield curve (0-2 years)
steepened with 2-year bond yields rising 337 basis
points (bps) over the year to 2.68%. The Dutch 10-
year rate climbed 294 bps to 2.91% at year-end 2022,
with brief downward movements in the summer and
autumn as recession fears flared up.

Housing and mortgage market
The housing market boom came to an end due to
the sharp rise in mortgage rates and the higher cost
of living. At the end of 2021, a 10-year fixed-rate
mortgage was available at a rate of 1.1%, but at the
end of the reporting period this rate had risen to 4.1%.
The change in supply/demand conditions came to the
fore in the observation that people were increasingly
selling their home before buying a new one, rather
than the other way around. House prices still increased
by 13.6% on average, with prices rising at a much
slower pace year-on-year in the second half of the year
and falling on a month-on-month basis since August.
The number of transactions declined by 14.6% after
a 4.0% decrease in 2021. According to HDN data1,
mortgage applications went down by 7.3% in 2022,
for the largest part attributable to the sharp decline
in mortgage renewals. Mortgages for the purpose of
buying a new home decreased by 3.2%.
Savings market
Despite the strong price rises, affecting individual
household budgets, the Dutch retail savings market
grew by € 24 billion in 2022 to € 431 billion. The
reversal from negative to positive savings rates and the
uncertain economic outlook may explain the ongoing
rise in savings.
1 HDN (Hypotheken Data Netwerk) collects and
communicates about the application and acceptance
process of financial products in the Netherlands.
1.1.2 Regulatory environment
As a result of an increasing number of laws and
regulations, at national and European level, it remains
both a challenge and a crucial aspect of de Volksbank’s
business operations to make sure we implement these
regulations in a proper and timely manner.
De Volksbank continues to work on its individual
resilience and stability without losing sight of the
interests of its customers and other stakeholders. In
this section we outline the most noteworthy laws
and regulations in relation to prudential supervision,
customer interests and sustainability that entered
into force in 2022 and how de Volksbank deals with
implementing them.
Prudential supervision
Below, we describe the key developments in prudential
supervision in 2022.
Implementation of Basel IV in the European Union
In order to reduce risk in the banking sector and
strengthen the Banking Union, the European Union
(EU) gradually revised its framework of harmonised
banking supervision rules over the past few years.
This prudential framework is represented by the
Capital Requirements Directive (CRD), the Capital
Requirements Regulation (CRR), the Bank Recovery and
Resolution Directive (BRRD) and the Single Resolution
Mechanism Regulation (SRMR). Implementation of the
2019 Banking package, containing the previous round
of reforms into this framework, was completed in
2021. As a final step, the European Commission (EC)

issued its draft proposals for the transposition of Basel
IV, known as CRR III and CRD VI, into EU legislation
in October 2021. The proposed implementation date
is 1 January 2025 with a 5-year phase-in period of
the output floor. The new prudential rules include the
introduction of a capital floor based on standardised
approaches, a revision of the standardised approach
for credit risk and new rules for operational and
market risk.
Capital and liquidity position
De Volksbank continuously looks from different
perspectives to see if the financial stability and
continuity of the bank is guaranteed. Supervisory
authorities are provided with our data reports and
analyses, such as ICAAP and ILAAP , external and
internal stress tests, the recovery plan and information
for the purposes of resolution planning by De
Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), the Central Bank of the
Netherlands. For more information on the BRRD,
ILAAP , ICAAP , SRMR/MREL and bail-in, see Section 4.
Risk Management.
Risk weighting floor of mortgage portfolio
As announced by DNB in 2019, the increase in risk
weights assigned to residential mortgage portfolios
was implemented with effect from 1 January 2022.
The measure would initially expire on 1 December
2022, but on 8 July 2022, DNB decided to extend
the measure until 1 December 2024. The risk weight
floor will apply to banks that use internal risk
models to calculate capital requirements for their
mortgage loan portfolios. This measure stems from
the framework that Article 458 of the CRR provides
to DNB for this purpose. The additional capital is
intended to strengthen Dutch banks’ capital to absorb
possible shocks in the Dutch housing market. For the
projected impact on de Volksbank, see Section 4.8.3
Developments in capital requirements.
EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring
EBA published the Guidelines on loan origination
and monitoring in May 2020. These Guidelines: i)
specify internal governance arrangements for granting
and monitoring credit facilities throughout their life
cycle; ii) clarify the credit decision-making process and
building on the requirements of the EBA Guidelines
on internal governance, and iii) set requirements for
assessing borrowers’ creditworthiness, including the
use of automated models, along with requirements for
handling information and data for such assessments.
These guidelines are to be gradually phased in as from
30 June 2021 to 2024. De Volksbank will integrate the
guidelines into its internal policies and processes in
line with this schedule.
Capital Markets Union
On 6 July 2021, the EC published a proposal for
a Green Bond Regulation to create a ’European
Green Bond Standard’. This Green Bond Regulation
will lay the foundation for a framework of rules
on the use of the 'European Green Bond' (EuGB)
designation for bonds that pursue environmentally
sustainable objectives under the Taxonomy Regulation.
The broader aim of the Green Bond Regulation
is to facilitate the further development of the
European market for green bonds. The EC hopes
that the development of this market will help
meet the EU’s climate and environmental objectives
under the Paris Agreement on climate change. The
Green Bond Regulation also aims to reduce the
risk of 'greenwashing' by setting high standards for
the issuance of green bonds, and forms part of
the European Green Deal which sets an objective
of making it easier for investors and companies
to identify credible sustainable investments. The
proposed framework entails four key requirements:
• the funds raised by the bond should be allocated
fully to projects in alignment with the EU Taxonomy;
• detailed reporting should provide full transparency
on how bond proceeds are allocated;
• all EU green bonds must be checked by an external
reviewer to ensure compliance with the Green Bond
Regulation and alignment of funded projects with
the EU Taxonomy; and
• external reviewers providing services to issuers of
EU green bonds should be registered with and
supervised by the European Securities Markets
Authority.
Even though the Green Bond Regulation will be a
voluntary standard giving issuers the choice to opt
for the EuGB designation or not, the EC has decided
to take a legislative route. It is very likely that the
designation will become the market standard for green
bond issuances in the EU. Green bond issuers in
the EU who are not compliant with the new rules
may also run the risk of greenwashing; compliance
being yet another reason to avoid supervisory
scrutiny. The developments regarding the Green Bond
Regulation and the EuGB designation are important to
de Volksbank in view of its Green Bond Framework and
the fact that it is a frequent issuer of green bonds.
In 2022, de Volksbank issued € 500 million of Senior
Non-Preferred Notes and € 300 million Additional
Tier 1 (AT1) Notes under its Green Bond Framework.
Customer interests
Being a social bank, we take our customers' interests
into account without losing sight of the other
stakeholders, i.e. society, our employees and our
shareholder. Below, we describe the most relevant
regulatory developments related to customer interests
in 2022.
General Data Protection Regulation
De Volksbank continues to enhance compliance with
the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to
protect the privacy of our customers and employees.
Privacy governance at de Volksbank underwent further
development. A team of first-line privacy staff that
supports the ongoing implementation of the GDPR,
was trained by the Data Protection Officer and the
Compliance department. De Volksbank also began to
incorporate the Processing Register into a supported
Privacy tooling, which will also facilitate the continued
development of privacy management within the
organisation.

Also, as a consequence of a decision by the Court
of Justice of the EU (CJEU) regarding data transfers,
all contracts with (sub)processors are scrutinised and
reassessed for the risks resulting from data processing
in countries outside the European Economic Area
(EEA). In addition, we concluded new Standard
Contractual Clauses (SCC) – where applicable – and
carried out Transfer Impact Assessments. To further
close the privacy gaps with respect to the data
warehouse, full migration of the data warehouse to the
new environment is necessary, de Volksbank continues
its efforts to phase out older data warehouses to the
new environment.
European Anti-Money Laundering Directives
De Volksbank takes all reasonable measures to prevent
the bank and/or the financial system in general from
money laundering and terrorist financing. Being a
social bank, we consider the gatekeeper function to
be an integral part of our business operations. The
ongoing changes to the laws and regulations impact
the processes and organisation of de Volksbank. We
continue to collaborate on certain AML-related topics
together with major banks and public parties, the
Financial Intelligence Unit and the national police.
In 2022, de Volksbank continued to participate
in Transaction Monitoring Netherlands (TMNL). In
this initiative, launched by ABN AMRO, ING Bank,
Rabobank, Triodos Bank and de Volksbank, said
banks are joining forces to contribute to boosting
the effectiveness of anti-money laundering and
financing of terrorism by bringing together transaction
data from different banks and making meaningful
connections between them.
Payment services
As far as payments are concerned, we monitor general
and legislative developments that will or may play
a major role in the coming years. One such a
development is the European Retail Payment Strategy,
which is part of the EU’s broader Open Finance
Strategy in which European acceptance of instant
payments is the key element. ECB’s investigations into
the possibility of issuing a digital euro is another topic
that is of great interest to us. With respect to access
to payment accounts, the European Payments Council
is developing a new scheme, SEPA Payment Account
Access (SPAA), in which user cases are reflected
that are mainly related to payment transactions.
This development towards a new scheme concerns
payment services on top of the mandatory services
arisen from PSD2. These services do not have to be
provided free of charge. The EC has discussed a review
of the PSD2 in 2022, and it has yet to be decided
whether PSD2 will see an update, or will completely
be replaced by PSD3. De Volksbank will closely monitor
any new directives.
Sanctions
Since the invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February
2022, several major sanctions packages have been
introduced by the EU and the United States, targeting
Russia, Belarus and the occupied territories of Ukraine.
As a result of these developments, DNB is increasingly
focussed on financial institutions' compliance with
sanctions regulations. De Volksbank complies with
the sanctions imposed and has adjusted its internal
policy and processes accordingly. Being a social bank,
de Volksbank strives to continuously contribute to
the effectiveness of (international) sanctions aimed
at maintaining or restoring international peace and
security, as well as at promoting the international legal
order.
Digital Operational Resilience Act
As part of the Digital Finance Package, the EC has
drafted regulation to increase the financial sector's
digital resilience: the Digital Operational Resilience
Act (DORA). A proposal for the DORA was published
on 24 September 2020. On 11 May 2022, the EU
Parliament and the EU Council reached an initial
agreement on the proposal. This agreement was
published on 23 June 2022. The final version of the
DORA has been accepted by the EC and was published
on 27 December 2022. The act will enter into force on
17 January 2025. De Volksbank is closely monitoring
regulatory developments on the DORA and will assess
the impact on the organisation through a gap and
impact analysis.
Settlement systems
De Volksbank is complying with Euro system’s initiative
to replace Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross
Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET2) with a new real-
time gross settlement (RTGS) system called T2 and
optimising liquidity management across all TARGET
Services. The new consolidated platform will be
launched in March 2023, together with SWIFT’s move
to ISO20022 called Cross Border Payment Reporting+
(CBPR+).
Sustainability
The EC presented the European Green Deal in
2019, consisting of a roadmap to make the EU's
economy sustainable and climate neutral with net-zero
greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The Sustainable
Finance Action Plan (SFAP) is an essential part of
achieving these policy goals and directly impacts
de Volksbank in certain areas. These regulatory
developments are often complex and released with
short time frames. Therefore, we closely monitor
these developments and other relevant initiatives, and
assess how they may affect our business units. In
response to this, we continued to embed sustainability
throughout the organisation, to integrate sustainability
into regular processes - such as risk management
processes - and to make de Volksbank's contribution
to sustainability tangible through our reporting.
De Volksbank is impacted by some material regulatory
developments such as disclosing information as to
what extent our funding activities are associated with
environmentally sustainable economic (taxonomy-
aligned) activities. The EU Taxonomy provides a
classification system of economic activities that
contribute to, and do not significantly harm, the
environment and safeguard minimum social standards
at the same time. For its Integrated Annual Report
2022, de Volksbank meets its obligation to report on
EU Taxonomy eligible activities.

De Volksbank also reports on Environmental, Social
and Governance (ESG) risks following the ECB’s Guide
on Climate and Environmental Related Risks and the
Pillar 3 disclosure on ESG risks. The ECB’s Guide
describes how the ECB expects financial institutions
to take these risks into account in their business
strategy, governance, and risk management. The Pillar
3 disclosure shows how transition risk and physical risk
resulting from climate change is affecting our balance
sheet and how these risks can exacerbate other risks.
It also gives qualitative information on our strategy,
governance and risk management framework on ESG
risks.
Furthermore, we are tracking regulatory developments
such as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting
Directive (CSRD), which entered into force on 5 January
2023 and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence
Directive (CSDDD) proposals. The CSRD is the revision
of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) and
will intensify and broaden the scope of the rules laid
down on the disclosure of companies' non-financial
and diversity information. The aim of the CSDDD
proposal is to foster sustainable and responsible
corporate behaviour and to embed human rights
and environmental considerations in companies’
operations and corporate governance. The new
directive will ensure that companies address adverse
impacts of their actions, also in their value chains.
We are closely monitoring implementation of these
regulatory developments, including the publicised set
of the European Sustainability Reporting Standards
by EFRAG. For more detailed information on our EU
taxonomy reporting obligations, see Section 2.5.2 EU
taxonomy. For more information on the EBA ESG Pillar

1.2.1 Our business
Our history
De Volksbank is a bank at the heart of society.
Our history dates back to 1817, the year in which
a number of regional savings banks merged with
the aim of taking good care of the money that
the Dutch people entrusted to us. Today, we serve
customers, entrepreneurs and small and medium-
sized enterprises. We do so mainly in the areas of
payments, savings and mortgages.
Our mission and ambition
We have a clear mission: banking with a human
touch. We achieve it by creating value for all our
stakeholders: our customers, society, our employees
and our shareholder. We aim for optimum total value
rather than maximisation of a single value and call this
our shared value ambition. We monitor and measure
against specific objectives and report on this shared
value ambition for each stakeholder group. For more
information, see Section 1.3 Our strategic progress in
this report and Section 3 of our Annual Review 2022.
1.2.2 Strategy 2021-2025: Better for
each other - from promise to !mpact
In 2022, we continued to build on our 2021 –
2025 strategy: Better for each other – from promise
to !mpact. This strategy has two main pillars with
which we aim to strengthen our distinctive capability:
we want to be the bank with the strongest customer
relationship in the Netherlands and to have a
substantial and measurable positive impact on society.
This distinctive capability is reflected in our four
brands, each with its own growth priorities. To
strengthen our distinctive capability and achieving
the brands’ growth priorities, our strategy has five
necessary change movements.
Pillar 1: Strong customer relationship
De Volksbank wants to stand out from its peers as the
bank with the strongest customer relationship. Each
of our four brands has always had their own identity
with a clear, social profile. Whether it is sustainability,
decent housing, quality of life in communities or
attention to the growth of each individual. Our
customers recognise the values and standards that our
brands share, allowing us to build strong relationships
with them. And we should cherish that relationship: it
is what sets us apart from other banks.
Pillar 2: Social impact
De Volksbank is committed to achieve a substantial
and measurable positive impact on society. Each
brand focuses on a specific social theme: ASN Bank
on sustainability, BLG Wonen on decent housing,
RegioBank on quality of live in the community and
SNS - as from 2022 - on attention to the growth
of every person. De Volksbank aims to create a
positive social impact across the board and to reduce
the negative impact. We do this by offering socially
relevant propositions and by being a driving force,
allowing us to contribute to changes at customer and
system level.
Four growth priorities
For the 2021-2025 strategic period, we have set the
following growth priorities for our brands:
1. Attract a younger target audience and strengthen
SNS’s business model with fee income;
2. Accelerate the growth of ASN Bank as a digital,
sustainable bank;
3. Reinforce RegioBank’s local presence by
broadening its propositions;
4. Expand BLG Wonen by increasing its distribution
reach and improving its service.
Five necessary movements of change
To enhance our distinctiveness and to realise our
brands’ growth priorities, our strategy features five
change movements, i.e. significant changes to our
processes and behaviour. In short, we will become
more agile and work smarter together on a flexible
IT infrastructure and offer our customers relevant
products in the way they want. The following is a brief
description of the five change movements:
1. Digital and omni-channel dialogue: we achieve a
greatly enhanced customer experience through
omni-channel dialogue and personalised access to
products and services.
2. Relevant range of products, new propositions and
small businesses as a new target market: we
deliver more value for our customers and the
bank by expanding our brands’ current product
range with existing and new propositions and
addressing the target market for small businesses.
Not just with our own products and services; we
are increasingly linking reliable partners to our
banking environment.
3. IT-based customer bank: we achieve a modular,
customer-driven IT infrastructure with more
automated IT processes.
4. Customer focused: our organisation becomes
more agile and tailored to customers’ needs
through the transformation to an agile
organisation.
5. Efficient and flexible: we increase our efficiency by
entering into more partnerships and increasing the
outsourcing of activities and services, as well as by
making the best use of our capital and the assets
on our balance sheet.
To this end, we are constantly working on
strengthening the organisational, employee and
leadership capabilities, while complying with laws
and regulations and guaranteeing the continuity of
systems.
Strategic objectives
The strategy for the coming years builds on our
mission to achieve a positive impact through banking
with a human touch: for our customers, society,
our employees and our shareholder. Based on the
strategic ambitions for 2021 – 2025 and the forecast
for the economic developments and financial markets,
we have set objectively measurable goals for each
stakeholder group, which are closely monitored. The
most material social topics (see Section 2.3 Material
topics) are reflected in the way in which we realise our
shared value ambition.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
OTHER OBJECTIVES
SWOT Matrix
As described in Section 1.1 Our operating
environment, the world is changing in many ways.
For us, these changes offer both opportunities and
threats. In addition, we have a number of strengths
and weaknesses that play an essential role in shaping
our future. In 2022, we continued to make progress
in differentiating ourselves through our strategy; we
launched the new agile organisation, and expanded
our product and service range, for example with the
ASN Sustainable non-life insurance in cooperation with
Dutch insurer a.s.r., and the SNS Valuation service.
We also made progress on several KPIs as defined in
our strategic plan. For more details on this topic, see
Section 1.3 Our strategic progress. The threats and
weaknesses are explained in more detail in Section
4.1.2 Top risks. The next page provides a brief overview
of what goes well and what should be improved.

Page 21:
Internal
Positive factors Negative factors
STRENGTHS
• Strong brands with high Net Promoter Score and 
Customer Relationship Score: de Volksbank brands 
generally have a higher NPS and stronger Customer 
Relationship Score than peer banks.
• Impact on society: this impact is manifested through 
the implementation of our progressive sustainability 
policy and the KPI for a climate-neutral balance sheet. 
Customers recognise and acknowledge this positive 
impact and this has resulted in high scores in the Fair 
Banking Guide. We are in the process of developing 
additional social impact KPIs.
• Solid positions in the Dutch retail market: with its 
core products payments, savings and mortgages, de 
Volksbank has a substantial market share in the Dutch 
retail market.
• Cost-efficient distribution model: the physical 
distribution costs per customer are lower compared 
with peer banks.
• Mission-driven organisation with people-oriented 
leadership and a high score on trust in each other 
and leadership: is apparent from our employee 
survey.
External
OPPORTUNITIES
• Social awareness: consumers are increasingly making 
choices from a broader social perspective. We also 
see this happen in the financial sector; for example, 
sustainable investing is becoming increasingly 
popular. De Volksbank sees great opportunities in the 
contribution that banks can make towards solving 
complex social problems. We ourselves focus mainly 
on the themes of sustainability, decent housing, 
equal growth opportunities and quality of life in 
communities. This makes us stand out as a social bank.
• Technology: new technology offers opportunities to 
strengthen customer relationships. Major technological 
developments include ‘open banking’, a modular and 
dynamic IT architecture, biometric authentication, 
artificial intelligence and robotic advisers. These 
developments make it possible to serve entire 
customer ecosystems in an integrated way, personalise 
customer and adviser services, increase efficiency 
and accelerate the time-to-market of innovations. 
Increased focus on data security, privacy and ethical 
issues surrounding technological developments also 
offer opportunities to distinguish ourselves as a safe 
and reliable bank.
THREATS 
• Increasing laws and regulations: the financial sector 
is facing increasing pressure from legislation and 
regulations, for instance from the EU Taxonomy. This 
demands a great deal of time, money and change 
capacity from banks.
• Digital revolution: technology has increased 
competition from other types of players, such as 
FinTech and BigTech. They are raising the bar for digital 
customer service. Moreover, banks are increasingly 
being called upon to address privacy, data security and 
ethical issues in the area of technology and data.
• Increasing competition in terms of social 
positioning and impact: other banks are increasingly 
focusing on sustainable banking. This is a positive 
development but also an additional challenge to 
further strengthen our distinctive position and  
driving role.
• High inflation: persistently high inflation, partly due 
to the current geopolitical situation and rising energy 
and gas prices, is creating higher burdens for our 
customers. This puts pressure on Dutch households’ 
purchasing power. It is still unclear to what extent 
government measures will be sufficient to prevent 
payment problems among Dutch households.
WEAKNESSES
• Lagging behind on primary customers and 
lower product density: compared with peers, our 
brands have relatively fewer primary customers and 
customers have fewer products on average.
• IT infrastructure: We are transforming our current 
IT landscape for better digital support and security. 
To ensure that our IT landscape becomes as future-
proof as possible and remains a driving force for the 
bank, fundamental changes are required in the coming 
years.
• Limitations in execution power and agility: 
de Volksbank is an engaged and mission-driven 
organisation whose execution power and agility must 
be improved. In early 2022, we switched to a new 
organisational structure and started working with the 
agile way of working. In total this takes 2-3 years before 
full implementation.

1.2.3 How we create value
Being a financial institution, we play an important
role in the Dutch economy and in society. We help
households save money and build up capital. We also
help businesses and households if they are short of
money, for example with a mortgage loan. We provide
(online) payment services and manage sustainable
funds in which our customers can invest. These
activities create value for our retail customers and
for small businesses throughout the Netherlands, our
chain partners and society as a whole. Our partners in
the chain also operate mostly in the Netherlands.
Moreover, as a social bank, we strive for a sustainable
and fair way of doing business. We give substance
to this by translating the Principles for Responsible
Banking (PRB) and the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) into strategic themes such as sustainability,
decent housing, equal growth opportunities and
quality of life. Given our shared value ambition, we
aim to create benefits for our customers, give genuine
attention to our employees, take responsibility for
society and achieve returns for our shareholder. We
realise that we can only do so if we remain a sound
and solid bank.
Value creation model
The value creation model on the previous pages is a
visual representation of the way in which we create,
or remove, value for our stakeholders. Resources, so-
called inputs, may increase or decrease due to external
developments, but also due to our own influence.
If we do not use these inputs with due care, we
run the risk of removing value. To prevent this, we
continuously adapt our activities. For example, our
biodiversity policy aims to ensure that we do not
finance activities that significantly harm natural capital.
Apart from implementing the progressive sustainability
policy, we continue to analyse topics of great value
to our stakeholders by means of the Materiality
Assessment, the Impact Analysis - as part of our
PRB implementation - and our customer surveys.
Creating value is not something to do in isolation.
That is why we aim to collaborate as effectively as
possible with partners. In many cases, we are the
driving force of collaboration. For more information
on the latter, see Section 2.2.4 Strategy, policies and
practices. An example of an input that we influence is
‘social capital’, part of which are customer relationships
and our reputation. Our activities result in certain
outputs, such as the number of customers. We
use the ‘Net Promoter Score’, our customer KPI, to
measure the customer satisfaction score. We use
the Customer Relationship Score to measure our
customer relationships to see if these have been
strengthened and if customers are satisfied, thus
improving our reputation in the long term as an
outcome. To complete the circle, we use this improved
relationship and reputation as input to tailor our
activities to the expectations of the customer. The
inputs, outputs and outcomes presented here are not
exhaustive. Each year, we try to get a better picture
of these aspects. The value creation model includes
the insights from an analysis of our surroundings
as we speak with our stakeholders and cooperate
as much as possible with our main partners, such
as the Dutch Banking Association and other civil
society organisations and initiatives (including PCAF,
PBAF and PLWF). For more information, see Section
2.2.5 Stakeholder engagement. The value creation
model can serve as guidance for the reader to
understand the connections in this report between
our inputs, activities, mission, vision and purpose, our
brands, products and services, our business model,
the internal and external environment we are active
in, risks and opportunties, our material topics and our
targets and KPIs. In addition we added a connectivity
matrix to visualisse these connections in a different
manner, please see Section Connectivity matrix.

Our strategic process
The strategy for the coming years builds on our
mission to achieve a positive impact through banking
with a human touch: for our customers, society,
our employees and our shareholder. Based on the
strategic ambitions for 2021 – 2025 and the forecast
for the economic developments and financial markets,
we have set objectively measurable goals for each
stakeholder group, which are closely monitored.
1.3.1 Strong customer relationship
De Volksbank aims to be a bank where people feel
at home. A bank that cares about easy-to-understand
products, privacy and security and that wholeheartedly
supports society. We strive to build strong customer
relationships; whatever we do must add value for
our customers. To measure the customer relationship
we defined three specific key performance indicators
(KPIs), each with its own target, i.e. the customer-
weighted Net Promoter Score (NPS), the number of
active multi-customers and the customer-weighted
average Customer Relationship Score (KRS).
Net Promoter Score
The customer-weighted average NPS2 declined to -1 in
2022, compared with +6 at year-end 2021. This was the
case across all our brands and was mainly related to
an increase in the number of detractors, which can be
attributed to the changing interest environment and
the introduction of the basic banking package. This
package combines several day-to-day banking activities
such as payments, savings and our personal services
and was introduced on 1 July 2022 for SNS and
RegioBank customers and on 1 October 2022 for ASN
Bank customers. Customers pay a fixed monthly fee
for this package no matter what product they have, like
for instance only a savings account. The NPS decrease
was mainly attributable to customers with a savings
account and no current account. De Volksbank has set
itself a goal of +13 by the end of 2025.
Number of active multi-customers
As from 2021, one of our customer KPIs is the number
of active multi-customers3. In 2022, this number rose
by 72,000 to 1,087,000. Our target for year-end 2025 is
1.3 million active multi-customers. The total number
of current account customers grew by 126,000 to
1,907,000. The total number of customers dropped
by 182,000 to 3,285,000, mainly due to the outflow of
mono savings customers following the introduction of
the basic banking package.
2 A positive NPS requires the percentage of promoters to
be higher than the percentage of detractors. Whether a
customer is a ‘promoter’ (9-10), ‘passively satisfied’ (7-8) or
a ‘detractor’ (0-6) is measured on a 1 to 10 scale. The NPS is
calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from
the percentage of promoters. The score can range from
-100% to +100%.
3 An active multi-customer is a customer with a current
account and at least one product from another product
group and may be a retail customer or a business customer.
An active current account is a current account on which the
customer initiated at least ten transactions for three months
in a row.
Customer Relationship Score
The customer-weighted average Customer
Relationship Score (KRS) is a new KPI. We developed
this score ourselves, in collaboration with the Behavior
Change Group. The customer-weighted average
KRS measures how strong the relationship is that
customers experience based on their satisfaction with,
trust in and brand love for their bank. The higher the
score, the stronger the relationship is perceived to
be. Over 2022, the customer-weighted average of the
banking brands was 53 (average 2021: 56)4. Our target
for year-end 2025 is a customer-weighted average KRS
of 60.
1.3.2 Social impact
We contribute to society through our principle of
shared value. We want to generate a positive social
impact where we can, minimise our negative impact
and make our own operations sustainable.
Climate-neutral balance sheet
At year-end 2022, we were 62% climate neutral which
puts us well on track to achieving our interim target
of at least 75% by 2025. This is the result of an
increase in financed renewable energy projects and an
increase in purchased green bonds with a strong focus
on renewable energy projects. The climate neutrality
continued to improve due to the decrease in the
electricity grid emission factor in the Netherlands,
and improvement of avoided emissions calculation
for renewable energy projects. As from 2021, the
climate-neutral balance sheet is calculated using the
Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF)
methodology.

Relationship Score (KRS) is the customer-weighted average
of all banking brands (SNS, ASN Bank, RegioBank). By means
of an extended matrix the strength of the relationship is
calculated based on the scores for satisfaction, trust in and
love for the brand. The scale ranges from 0 to 100.

831 kilotons in 2022 compared to 742 kilotons in
2021, also recalculated. See Section Definition and
methodology of strategic KPIs for more information.
Green bonds
De Volksbank sees the issuance of green bonds as an
effective tool to make a positive contribution to the
climate and achieving the Sustainable Development
Goals of the United Nations. We aim to further
diversify our investor base through our green financing
strategy by focussing on socially responsible and highly
dedicated sustainable investors and by strengthening
the relationship with existing investors.
The most recent Green Bond Framework, reviewed
in 2021, is in line with our new strategy and the EU
Taxonomy. The Green Bond asset pool was positively
assessed for compliance with this Taxonomy. For
more information on the Green Bond Framework,
accompanying publications, and on the EU Taxonomy,
see our website and Section 2.5.2 EU taxonomy
respectively. In 2022 de Volksbank issued € 0.5 billion
in Green Senior Non-Preferred notes and € 0.3 billion
in Green Additional Tier 1 notes. Taking into account
the two Green Senior Unsecured Private Placements
that matured in 2022, the outstanding amount of
Green Bond issuances at year-end 2022 equals

Decent Housing
We are integrating the Decent Housing theme in our
services. In 2022, we translated this theme into three
KPIs, which we will fine-tune in 2023:
• Making housing accessible to households earning
up to twice the average income.
• Sustainable recovery based on financial care during
major life events.
• Construction of new residential units.
For more information, see our Annual Review 2022.
In addition to our own targets and actions, we
are calling upon governments, businesses and other
partners to jointly strive for a sustainable and fair
society. Collaborations with PCAF, PBAF, the European
Citizens' Initiative, which calls for concrete measures
to ensure workers in the garment industry are paid
a living wage, NLvoorElkaar and other initiatives such
as Eurowise (teaching materials) and our Housing
Accessibility Monitor, are just a few examples of our
concrete actions.
1.3.3 Four growth priorities of the
brands
Our brands showed the first signs of progress in
achieving their growth priorities for the next few years:
• SNS broadened its target audience by including
younger customers and strengthening its business
model with more fee income. In 2022, we launched
three campaigns, we updated our brand promise
and introduced new products and services, for retail
customers as well as for self-employed persons and
SMEs.
• ASN Bank aims to accelerate growth as a digital,
sustainable bank. In 2022, the number of ASN Bank
customers decreased mainly due to the introduction
of the basic banking package. Yet, the number of
investment accounts grew.
• RegioBank continued to have a strong local
presence with a broad range of propositions and
was again voted ‘most customer-friendly bank’ in
the Netherlands in May 2022.
• BLG Wonen is further expanding its distribution
reach and service. The bank organised various
events and is working on a power of attorney for
service providers. Furthermore, we actively helped
people who are looking to buy a home and spend
a large portion of their income on rent (high-rent
tenants), to improve their chances of getting a
mortgage.
1.3.4 Five necessary change movements
1. Digital and omni-channel dialogue
De Volksbank aims to strengthen its relationship
with its customers and advisers by providing a
human touch in customer contact and consistent
and personalised service through online and offline
channels. To this end, we delivered a new My
environment in 2022 and rolled out an adviser portal
(My Office). We also modernised the setup and design
of the banking app, the rollout of which will take
place in 2023. Products and services can now be
purchased through multiple digital channels, and by
using a Volksbank Design System, a consistent and
recognisable experience is provided for customers.
To make customer contact more personal, a chatbot
and live chat have been added as contact options in
the SNS banking app and My environment. In addition,
we have developed the option to show personalised
messages to customers in the banking app and My
environment when relevant. For our other brands, we
have also planned this approach in 2023.

2. Relevant range of products, new propositions
and small businesses as a new target market
We deliver more value for our customers and the
bank by expanding our brands’ current product range
with existing and new propositions and addressing the
target market for small businesses.
To enhance our personal engagement with SMEs and
strengthen our local presence, in 2022 we provided
the right knowledge and support in the distribution
channels. For example, we improved application
processes, making business financing even easier
and faster to take out, and expanded our online
platform where SME customers can compose their
own tailor-made services. We also continued to work
towards sustainable customer relationships by talking
to customers about the challenges they encountered
and how, for instance, sustainability can be a structural
solution for future-proof business operations.
We are committed to improving the financeability of
SMEs in the Netherlands. For example, we proactively
engage in dialogue with politicians, and our SNS and
RegioBank brands have conducted various campaigns
specifically aimed at small business owners. Together,
these activities have allowed our SME portfolio to grow
and awareness of de Volksbank brands as the bank for
small business owners to increase.
In 2022, we partnered with more independent financial
advisers. Customers may now use the services of
valuation platform Fitrex, which offers the possibility
of requesting (desktop) valuations and providing
bank guarantees through Nationale Waarborg (National
Guarantee). Since October, SNS customers can take
out a new business insurance package through our
partner NN, an insurance company, marking an
expansion of insurance products and the target group.
SNS, ASN Bank and RegioBank also introduced a Basic
Banking package. This package combines several day-
to-day banking activities such as payments, savings
and our personal services. Customers pay a fixed
monthly rate for this package.
3. IT-based customer bank
We want to achieve a modular, customer-driven,
mostly cloud-based IT infrastructure with more
automated IT processes. In 2022 we worked on
our customer bank transition by starting to build
the new customer administration, delivering the
first components of our workflow management
system, improving the data platform and working
on continuous integration and delivery through
development pipelines. These developments will
continue in 2023.
4. Customer focused
To accomplish a transition towards a more customer-
oriented organisation, we need to transform into an
agile organisation. The programme set up to this end
is called Klantificeren Graag! aims to bring about this
transition based on the 'de Volksbank collaboration
model'. In 2022, 100% of the organisation in scope
had implemented an agile working method, including
an agile mindset and agile behaviour. In addition to
the Scrum and KanBan tools for (change) teams, we
started the rollout of Lean for our service teams. A first
evaluation of de Volksbank collaboration model took
place at the end of 2022, focussing on the 'set-up' and
'existence', knowing that we have allocated 2-3 years
for the optimal functioning of the model. The agile
maturity of change teams was measured for the first
time in November 2022, creating a starting point for
teams to start with their own continuous development.
5. Efficient and flexible
We are continuously looking for opportunities to work
more efficiently and flexibly. We are working on this
partly through the new agile way of working as
explained in change movement 4 above, but also by
looking for an ideal mix of partnerships, outsourcing
and doing work ourselves. Apart from this, it is
important that we make the best use of the assets on
our balance sheet. To that end, in 2022, we assessed
key purchasing contracts and, based on the outcomes,
we re-engaged with suppliers on contracts where
required. We also started outsourcing processes on
various IT components. More information on the main
steps and developments on the balance sheet and
use of capital can be found in Section 4.8 Capital
management.
1.3.5 Strategic objectives
The strategic objectives for our customers are
explained in Section 1.3.1 Strong customer relationship
and for society in Section 1.3.2 Social impact. As to the
progress towards our other objectives, we provide an
update below.
GENUINE ATTENTION FOR EMPLOYEES
We want to empower employees to make a
meaningful contribution to our mission and strategy
by giving attention to autonomy, personal growth
and professionalism. Every six months, we monitor
the key performance indicators (KPIs) of creating
shared value for employees: genuine attention and
commitment and engagement. For the KPI ‘genuine
attention’ we aim for a score of at least 7.5 (on a
1-10 scale) in 2025. For commitment and engagement
the goal is a score of 8.0. In November 2022, 79,9%
of all employees participated in the employee survey.
The scores for genuine attention as well as for
commitment and engagement remained high at 7.6,
7.8 and 7.4 respectively (October 2021: 7.8, 7.9 and
7.4 respectively). Taking into account the impact of the
transformation into an agile organisation, we consider
these to be satisfactory scores.

RETURN FOR OUR SHAREHOLDER
De Volksbank aims to be a financially healthy and
stable bank with low risk activities. Our target Return
on Equity (RoE) is 8%.
Return on equity
In 2022, the bank achieved a Return on Equity (RoE)
of 5.2%, compared to 4.7% in 2021, thanks to higher
net profit. As communicated earlier, we are making
substantial investments to implement the strategy
2021-2025 aiming to achieve a RoE of 8% by the end
of 2025.
Dividend
De Volksbank has set a target range of 40% - 60%
of net profit for the regular dividend distribution.
In line with this policy, de Volksbank decided in its
General Meeting of Shareholders (GMS) in April 2022
to distribute a dividend of € 97 million for 2021,
corresponding to a pay-out ratio of 60%.
Driven by de Volksbank’s annual profit and considering
current economic and geopolitical uncertainty, we
propose to pay out 50% of the bank's net profit5 to
our shareholder for the financial year 2022, which
corresponds to a dividend amount of € 90 million.
OTHER STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
Capital and leverage ratio
The target level of the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)
ratio and the leverage ratio are based on Basel IV and
the end-state of the CRR Non-performing Exposures
(NPE) rules.
De Volksbank's CET1 capital ratio decreased to 20.3%,
from 22.7% at year-end 2021 as risk-weighted assets
increased, largely related to the increased short-term
exposures to other financial institutions and exposures
to corporates, used to optimise the return on excess
liquidity. The CET1 capital ratio remained well above
our target of at least 19%.
The leverage ratio declined to 4.7%, from 5.1% at
year-end 2021, as the € 9.5 billion leverage ratio
denominator growth had a bigger impact than the
€ 217 million increase in Tier 1 capital.
Please refer to the Section 4.8 Capital management
for an explanation of our capital objectives and
achievements.
5 Excluding AT1 coupon payments.
Cost/income ratio
In 2022, higher total income and virtually stable
operating expenses including regulatory levies resulted
in an improved cost/income ratio (C/I ratio) of 67.9%
compared to 80.7% in the previous year. We expect the
C/I ratio to meet the 2025 target range of 57-59% as
the implementation of strategic initiatives is intended
to gradually improve both income and operating
expense levels. Furthermore, due to the changed
interest rate environment, the prospect of a positive
development of total income has improved.
For more information on the cost/income ratio, see
Section 1.4.2 Financial results.
1.3.6 Options for the future
On 26 January 2022, during a general consultation on
State participations, the Minister of Finance mentioned
that, as far as de Volksbank was concerned, NLFI had
indicated a period of approximately three years before
any decision on the bank's future options could be
taken.
On 7 July 2022, the Dutch Minister of Finance informed
the House of Representatives about NLFI’s most recent
progress report on de Volksbank. In this report, dated
30 June 2022, NLFI stated that de Volksbank made a
good start in creating a more robust organisation and
strengthening its social identity since the introduction
of the new strategy. NLFI remarked that further
measures will be necessary to achieve a structural
improvement of financial results and that market
dynamics, i.e. higher inflation, higher interest rates,
geo-political developments, may have an impact and
may require further adjustments. The implementation
of the strategy and the subsequent improvement of
financial results will require several years and the
Minister of Finance noted that de Volksbank should
be given time to bring this about and that it was too
early for a definitive decision on the privatisation of
the bank. 
On 22 February 2023, the Minister of Finance,
following up on the letter of 7 July 2022, wrote to
the House of Representatives that, in order to avoid
unnecessary delay, she intends to take a directional
decision about the future of de Volksbank before the
end of 2023. In the decision, all options for the future
and all governance models will be taken into account,
as well as the eventual necessity for the State to
safeguard the public interests related to de Volksbank.
The House of Representatives, NLFI, de Volksbank, and
where necessary the supervisory authorities, will be
involved in the preparation of the directional decision.
The Minister concluded that a definitive choice for a
future option can only be made when NLFI concludes
that de Volksbank is ready for a decision.

Customers and payments
As from 2021, one of our customer KPIs is the number
of active multi-customers. In 2022, this number rose
by 72,000 to 1,087,000. Our target for year-end
2025 is 1.3 million. The total number of current
account customers grew by 126,000 to 1,907,000. The
total number of customers decreased by 182,000 to
3,285,000, mainly due to the outflow of mono savings
customers following the introduction of the above-
mentioned basic banking package.
De Volksbank’s market share of new current accounts
grew to 23% (2021: 20%). This market share is
significantly above the market share on a total

Mortgages
De Volksbank’s residential mortgage portfolio,
excluding IFRS value adjustments, grew to € 48.3 billion
(year-end 2021: € 47.2 billion) as new production
exceeded redemptions. As the mortgage rates rose,
homeowners were eager to lock in rates for a longer
period of time, increasing their financial security. In
2022, the share of new mortgages with a fixed interest
rate of 15 years or longer amounted to 60% of our
total mortgage originations (2021: 71%). Impacted by
the sharp increase in mortgage rates as from the
second quarter, there was a shift towards 10-year fixed
mortgage rates and the market for new mortgages
contracted. New mortgage production amounted to
€ 7.4 billion (2021: € 8.1 billion). Our market share of
new residential mortgage production stood at 5.4%,
compared to 5.8% in 2021. Repayments amounted to
€ 6.3 billion, compared to € 7.0 billion in 2021, mainly
due to the decreasing mortgage refinancing volumes.
Interest rate renewals amounted to € 1.9 billion, a
decrease compared to 2021 (€ 2.4 billion), mainly due
to lower regular renewals.
Savings
In 2022, savings deposits at de Volksbank decreased
by € 1.1 billion to € 44.5 billion, mainly driven
by the changed interest rate environment and the
introduction of a monthly fee for the basic banking
package. In a market in which household savings grew,
our market share decreased to 10.4%, from 11.3% at
year-end 2021.

NET RESULT
Compared to 2021, net profit increased by € 29 million
to € 191 million. Both years included positive incidental
items in the amount of € 17 million after tax.
In 2022, net profit included a release of the
restructuring provision of € 23 million before tax in
relation to the agile way of working. The organisation
is in the process of being structured differently and
transitioning to a uniform and agile way of working.
This approach leads to more efficient collaboration
and a flatter organisation. The restructuring provision
was reassessed, resulting in a release of € 23 million.
This release is the result of a rapidly changing
regulatory environment, which requires additional
professional expertise and capacity within the bank.
The envisaged reduction in existing FTEs was adjusted
in favour of re-employment in other vacancies mainly
related to additional regulatory and compliance topics,
resulting in fewer redundancies.
In 2021, net profit also included incidental items
of € 17 million, consisting entirely of a positive
revaluation of € 22 million before tax of a previous
contribution made under the Deposit Guarantee
Scheme (DGS) in relation to the insolvency of DSB.
Net profit, adjusted for incidental items, rose by
€ 29 million (+20%) to € 174 million. Total income
was € 138 million higher, with all income line items
contributing to this. Net interest income increased
due to the improving interest rate environment and
net fee and commission income continued to grow,
reflecting our ambition to further diversify our income
sources. Other income was positively impacted by high
results from swaptions used to hedge our interest rate
risk. This more than compensated for a € 110 million
swing in impairment charges of financial assets. Total
operating expenses, adjusted for incidental items,
decreased by € 12 million due to € 10 million lower
regulatory levies.

Net interest income
Net interest income increased by € 76 million to
€ 851 million (+10%) and the net interest margin
rose to 1.15% (2021: 1.11%). Both increases were
mainly driven by the more favourable interest rate
environment in the second half of 2022. As a result
of rising interest rates, the interest on liquidities
deposited with financial institutions, such as the
ECB, went up, showing a swing from interest paid
to interest received. In addition, interest income on
our investment portfolio increased, while expenses to
hedge our interest rate risk decreased.
Interest expenses on savings also went down slightly.
Until 1 October 2022, our brands charged 0.5%
interest per year on that part of the balance that
exceeded € 100,000, due to the low and negative
interest rates on financial markets. As from 1 October
2022, we no longer charged negative interest rates
and as from 1 December 2022 our brands started
offering a positive savings rate. In 2022, savings
deposits at de Volksbank decreased by € 1.1 billion to
€ 44.5 billion, mainly driven by the changed interest
rate environment and the introduction of a monthly
fee for the basic banking package. In a market in which
household savings grew, our market share decreased
to 10.4%, from 11.3% at year-end 2021.
Finally, 2021 included a charge of € 13 million
related to a provision to compensate customers
with a consumer facility with variable rates. For the
expansion of the compensation scheme, we increased
the provision by an additional € 5 million in 2022.
The aforementioned positive items were partly offset
by lower mortgage income, higher wholesale funding
expenses and reduced compensation for loss of
interest income due to mortgage prepayments.
Income on mortgages decreased as a result of interest
rate renewals at lower rates. On top of that, new
mortgage production was concluded at lower rates
than the rates of repaid mortgages. In 2022, the
residential mortgage portfolio, excluding IFRS value
adjustments6, showed an increase to € 48.3 billion
(year-end 2021: € 47.2 billion).
Wholesale funding expenses were higher due to
issuances of senior non-preferred debt - to strengthen
our MREL ratio - and covered bonds.
Compensation for loss of interest income due to
mortgage prepayments declined sharply in the second
half of 2022 as mortgage rates rose significantly
and the mortgage refinancing market contracted
accordingly. For the whole year, this compensation
amounted to € 70 million, which was below the level
received in 2021 (€ 103 million). The compensation
amount in 2022 included a € 20 million gain related
to the refinement of the amortisation model.
6 Consisting of fair value adjustments from hedge accounting
and amortisations.
Net fee and commission income
Total fee and commission income rose by € 17 million
to € 154 million (+12%), while total fee and commission
expenses went up by € 5 million to € 103 million.
On balance, net fee and commission income rose
by € 12 million to € 51 million (+31%), mainly
due to higher fees from mortgage advice and from
property valuation platform Fitrex B.V. (acquired on
1 September 2021). In addition, payment fees went up
and the introduction of a monthly rate for the basic
banking package contributed to the rise in net fee
income.
Management fees were below last year's level as
assets under management decreased by € 0.8 billion
to € 3.9 billion on account of negative stock market
developments.
Investment income
Investment income amounted to € 8 million negative,
compared to € 3 million positive in 2021. In both
years investment income consisted entirely of realised
results on fixed-income investments, sold as part of
asset and liability management and the optimisation of
the investment portfolio.
Other results on financial instruments
Other results on financial instruments increased
to € 70 million, compared to € 10 million for
the previous year. This high level was driven by
exceptional circumstances in the financial markets,
which were reflected in the sharp rise in ECB
interest rates and persistently high market volatility.
The result in 2022 was mainly driven by an
exceptional amount of € 46 million for swaptions
used to protect (hedge programme) the bank's long-
term interest income against sharply rising market
interest rates. As the reason for protection occurred
in 2022, a non-recurring gain was realised. In
addition, treasury results improved on the back of
the changing market environment, and results on
derivatives related to sold investments went up. These
results were partly offset by lower results on hedge
accounting ineffectiveness of mortgages. Although the
relative hedge effectiveness was high, market value
movements of derivatives and related mortgages were
significant, driven by sharply rising interest rates.

Total operating expenses decreased by € 12 million
to € 655 million (-2%). Both 2021 and 2022 included
positive incidental items. In 2022, operating expenses
included a release of the agile restructuring provision
of € 23 million, while in 2021, operating expenses were
positively impacted by a € 22 million revaluation of a
previous contribution made under the DGS in relation
to the insolvency of DSB.
Excluding incidental items, total operating expenses
declined by € 11 million (-1%). Regulatory levies
amounted to € 69 million (2021: € 79 million), of which
€ 14 million linked to the resolution fund contribution
(2021: € 11 million), and € 55 million to the ex-ante
DGS contribution (2021: € 68 million). The lower DGS
contribution was mainly due to lower covered deposit
growth year-on-year.
Operating expenses excluding incidental items and
regulatory levies went down by € 1 million. Staff costs
decreased by € 8 million, partly due to a decrease
in total FTEs as a result of the successful roll-out of
the agile way of working. Compared to year-end 2021,
the total number of FTEs dropped by 74 to 3,887,
consisting of a reduction of 55 internal FTEs to 3,123
and of 19 external FTEs to 764.
Other operating expenses, excluding regulatory levies
and incidental items, increased by € 5 million, mainly
due to higher IT and consultancy costs for investments,
such as in Know Your Customer (KYC)-related projects.
The increase was partly compensated by lower
marketing costs.
A combination of lower adjusted expenses and higher
average assets reduced the adjusted cost/ assets ratio

Total impairment charges of financial assets amounted
to € 52 million in 2022, compared to a reversal of
€ 58 million in 2021. Actual defaults of residential
mortgages and SME loans remained very low, but
the deteriorated economic outlook used in our
provisioning models resulted in a higher level of
impairments. For a more detailed description of the
impairments based on the ‘Expected Credit Loss’
model in line with IFRS 9, see Section 4.3 Credit risk.
Residential mortgages
In 2022, we took an impairment charge of € 17 million
for residential mortgages, where a reversal of
€ 46 million was recognised in 2021. The overall loan
loss provision includes a management overlay that
decreased in 2022. This decrease was mainly driven by
a release of the Covid-19-related overlay as the impact
of the virus on society was not as negative as initially
estimated, and by a release of the management
overlay for an adjusted scenario simulating the house
price development. Conversely, a new management
overlay has been included to account for the risk of
high inflation affecting our customers' ability to repay
their loan(s). The management overlay decrease was
more than offset by an increase in modelled provisions
driven by a less positive macroeconomic outlook,
most notably lower expected house prices, and model
improvements.
The reversal in 2021 followed from an improved
macroeconomic outlook, most notably rising house
prices. The positive impact from the improved outlook
was partly offset by the application of a higher
management overlay as the uncertainty remained high
at this point in time.

Consumer loans
Impairment charges on other consumer loans
consisted of a reversal of € 3 million, as opposed to
a charge of € 3 million in 2021. The charge in 2021
was mainly driven by the implementation of a new
regulatory definition of default.
SME loans
Impairment charges on SME loans consisted of a small
charge of € 2 million as the credit quality of the
portfolio remained sound. In 2021 there was a reversal
of € 12 million, driven by an improved macroeconomic
outlook, in particular an expected reduction in the
number of insolvencies.
Other corporate and government loans
Impairment charges on other corporate and
government loans rose to € 23 million, caused by
increased credit risk of a few individual loans provided.
In 2021, impairment charges on other corporate and
government loans consisted of a reversal of € 4 million
as the credit risk on the same loans decreased.
Loans to banks
Impairment charges on loans to banks amounted
to € 5 million (2021: nil), driven by increased credit
spreads.
Investments
Impairment charges on investments amounted to
€ 8 million, compared to € 1 million in 2021. This
increase was mainly driven by increased credit spreads
on our fixed-income portfolio.
Outlook
We expect net interest income in 2023 to continue
to improve, benefitting from the changing interest
rate environment. We expect interest income on
mortgages and other assets to improve gradually
and hedging costs to decline, partially offset by an
increase in funding costs. Net fee and commission
income is expected to increase reflecting the progress
of our growth initiatives. Other results on financial
instruments are expected to return to a lower level as
the financial year 2022 was positively impacted by a
gain on swaptions used for hedging purposes. In all,
we expect total income to be higher compared to the
2022 level.
We also expect operating expenses to be higher,
mainly driven by IT security investments and
projects related to banking regulations and customer
compliance supporting our aspiration to be a more
robust and resilient organisation.
The impact of geopolitical developments, such as the
war in Ukraine, and of the macroeconomic forecasts
on our customers and their financial resilience, is
highly uncertain. Consequently, this may impact our
loan loss provisioning levels. We expect to increase
these levels in line with our outlook for moderate loan
growth.
Taking into account the factors described above, we
expect net profit for 2023 to be above that of 2022.

1.4.3 Reconciliation of alternative
performance measures
Our financial results are prepared and reported
in accordance with IFRS-EU, as detailed in Section
Financial statements. We also present alternative
performance measures, i.e. non-IFRS financial
measures. These include the adjusted performance
that we use to align internal and external reporting,
identify and quantify items that management believes
to be significant, and provide insight into how
management assesses the bank's period-on-period
performance.
To derive the adjusted performance, we adjust for
certain incidental items, i.e. items that have an impact
on the net result in excess of € 15 million and have
an incidental nature, thus limiting insight into the

2.1 Introduction
In this chapter we present our sustainability
information. The information disclosed in sections
2.2 General disclosures, 2.3 Material topics and 2.4
Topic-specific disclosures is in accordance with the
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 2021 Standards. The
structure of these sections is inspired by the order
of requirements in the GRI Standards. Also presented
in this section are ESG ratings and other ESG-related
disclosures, for example about our results on the EU
Taxonomy. More details on our reporting approach can
be found in Section Our approach to reporting.
Sustainability is a broad and complex concept. When
we think of sustainability we generally envision a world
in which a balance is struck between humanity, the
environment and the economy - now and in the future.
The definition of sustainable development from the
1987 UN report 'Our Common Future' (Brundtland) is
the foundation of how we conceptualise sustainability:
'Sustainable development is development that meets
the needs of the present without compromising the
ability of future generations to meet their own needs.'
This definition shapes our efforts to make a positive
impact on the environment and society as a bank.
The term ‘Environmental, Social and Governance’, in
other words ESG, has become an industry standard
for categorising sustainability by means of these
three themes. Said themes are in line with our
Sustainability Policy, which comprises three pillars:
climate, biodiversity and human rights. Governance is
an important precondition for sustainability, this is true
for de Volksbank itself as well as for the organisations
we invest in.
This paragraph discusses some developments with
regard to ESG-related matters. The outside-in risks
and our risk management related to sustainability are
described in more detail in Section 4.9 Sustainability
Risk.
2.2 General disclosures
2.2.1 Our organisation and our
reporting practice
De Volksbank N.V. is a retail bank with sustainable
business operations that provides services to
private individuals, self-employed persons and small
businesses in the Netherlands. For more information
on our organisational details, see our Company profile.
De Volksbank has four brands: SNS, ASN Bank,
RegioBank and BLG Wonen. All of these brands are
included in the financial and sustainability reporting
framework of de Volksbank N.V. For more information
on the consolidation of (non-)financial statements,
refer to Section Financial statements and Section Our
approach to reporting.
2.2.2 Our activities and employees
De Volksbank operates in the Dutch financial sector.
Our product range comprises: payments, mortgages,
sustainable funds, SME loans, savings and insurance
products. Our customers are mainly based in the
Netherlands. For more detailed information on our
activities and services, see our Company profile.
As a financial institution we do not have a traditional
supply chain. We do, however, engage with the supply
chain of particular industries that we invest in, such
as the garment industry. For more information on
this topic, see the information on human rights in
Section 2.5.1 Other material topics. With regard to
certain products and services we deal with (Dutch)
suppliers such as writers, designers, photographers,
and presswork businesses. We regularly engage with
our key suppliers, i.e. we meet with them and discuss
the status and progress of our business relationship.
With regard to other relevant business relationships,
de Volksbank engages with NGOs, knowledge-sharing
networks and other organisations and (local)
governments. Refer to Section 2.2.4 Strategy, policies
and practices for more information on our business
relationships.
New collective labour agreement
In 2022, negotiations with the trade unions
resulted in a new collective labour agreement
(collective agreement) that runs from 1 January 2023
until December 2024. Employees were given the
opportunity to provide input and were involved in
drawing up the new collective agreement, for example
by means of employee meetings. Besides salary
increases, the main focus of this collective agreement
is on arrangements that further highlight the social
and inclusive nature of de Volksbank. For example,
it offers employees the possibility of embracing
diversity and inclusion in a personal way, and more
inclusive leave arrangements. Our leave arrangement
for volunteering was made more appealing, and the
existing arrangement for older employees to work
longer in good health has been expanded. Of our
employees, 99% falls within the scope of the collective
agreement. As senior management falls outside the
scope of this agreement, a separate remuneration
policy applies to them. See Section 3.4 Remuneration
Report for more information.
Everyone at de Volksbank is permitted to perform
voluntary work and the collective agreement contains
arrangements on this. Our employees get a certain
number of hours off, equivalent to twice the average
amount of working hours per day, to do voluntary
work during working hours.

Of the total number of employees at de Volksbank,
about 20% are external employees. Compared to 2021,
this number decreased slightly. Externals are hired to
deal with formation bottlenecks, such as vacancies, for
temporary change projects and for peaks in workload.
2.2.3 Governance
The governance structure of de Volksbank changed in
2022. As part of the new strategic plan for 2021-2025
de Volksbank introduced an Executive Committee
(ExCo) which replaced the former Board of Directors
as from 16 May 2022 to add focus and balance to
the management of the organisational transition. For
detailed information on the governance structure of
de Volksbank and role of the highest governance body,
see Section 3. Governance.
The topic of sustainability governance is of great
importance to de Volksbank, also with regard to
the organisations that we invest in or finance.
The Sustainability Management Policy describes
the governance of de Volksbank's approach to
sustainability. The development and implementation
of sustainability is assigned to owners within the
ExCo and senior management. The Social Impact
Committee (SIC) is a risk committee with a broad
mandate that is responsible for the development
of our sustainability initiatives, our social impact
and the impact of sustainability matters on the
bank. The SIC meets 8 times a year, or more
frequently if required and is chaired by the Chief Risk
Officer, representing the ExCo. For more information
on this committee and information related to the
sustainability governance of de Volksbank, see Section
3.5 Sustainability Governance.
As de Volksbank’s mission is Banking with a human
touch, this implies that we also add a human touch
to the remuneration of our employees. In establishing
the compensation policy and actual compensation, we
take account of our stakeholders, i.e. our customers,
society, our employees and the shareholder. For
detailed information on our remuneration policies, see
Section 3.4 Remuneration Report.

lifelong learning programme, see Section 3.2 Report of
the Supervisory Board.
2.2.4 Strategy, policies and practices
SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY
De Volksbank aims to have a positive impact on society
and to reduce its negative impact. We do so by offering
socially responsible propositions. This approach, in
turn, also contributes to the resilience of de Volksbank
against transitional and physical sustainability-related
risks. For example, due to our stringent sustainability
policy, we do not have any exposures in companies
that are directly involved in the extraction and
combustion of fossil fuels. Therefore, we do not face
any transitional risks related to this type of asset. All
in all, the pre-existing strategic focus on social impact
results in a relatively low risk profile for Environmental,
Social and Governance (ESG) related matters.
In 2021, we presented the Strategy 2021-2025,
which explicitly aims to accelerate our positive social
impact. In developing this new strategy, de Volksbank
used various plausible scenarios of marketplace
developments, including inputs related to ESG factors
and risks. In this process we also analysed important
internal and external developments. Inputs in this
field included scenario analyses, such as sustainability
scenarios, consultations with our stakeholders, the
materiality matrix, stress tests and the annual Strategic
Risk Assessment.
The strategic time horizon is medium term (5
years), spanning from 2021 to 2025. However, our
sustainability KPIs exceed the horizon of the strategic
plan with long-term objectives for 2030 (10 years) and
2050 (30 years). De Volksbank's strategic plan should
be seen as an adaptive plan, which means that we
will continuously assess and adapt the strategy and
forthcoming plans on a short-term basis (1 year) if
necessary. The annual Strategic Risk Assessment is
an important tool to recalibrate the strategy against
internal and external trends, including important
developments in ESG risks.
We use various metrics to assess our sustainability
related risks and opportunities. The table below sets
out some of our metrics and targets.

Our KPI 'climate-neutral balance sheet' consists of an
estimation of the emissions avoided with our activities
and the emissions caused by us. These calculations
are based on the PCAF methodology and cover scope
1, 2 and 3 emissions. For more details on our climate-
neutral balance sheet and methodology, see Section
Definition and methodology of strategic KPIs.
De Volksbank is the first financial institution in the
Netherlands with approved Science Based Targets
(SBT) for our scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. The latter
includes emission reduction targets on mortgages (real
estate), renewable energy (power), and investments
covering relevant balance sheet categories.

Sustainability House of Policies
The Sustainability Management Policy describes
the governance of de Volksbank's approach to
sustainability. This document forms the basis for the
further development of specific sustainability policies
for the various business activities. Together they form
the so-called Sustainability House of Policies, the
purpose of which is to have a well-understood and
accepted governance and definition of sustainability
for the bank and its stakeholders. The bank's approach
to sustainability covers all of its activities and is
applied at the following four levels. The approval
of the different policies within de Volksbank-wide
Sustainability House of Policies lies with the Board of
ASN Bank.

Level 1 Sustainability Management Policy (SMP)
The SMP serves as a framework for companywide
awareness on sustainability and the resulting
application throughout the organisation. The SMP
primarily covers the governance, strategic ambition,
responsibilities and procedures.
Level 2 & 3 Sustainability Policies (SP) and Specific
Sustainability Policies (SSP)
The SPs and SSPs contain all detailed information
on sustainability content that applies to the entire
organisation, including our investments. Sustainability
is not static, so the exact number and themes in
relation to the content of the sustainability policies
may vary from time to time. In SSPs, we provide
additional guidance and criteria for specific themes
(such as animal welfare or plastics), sectors (such
as financials) or asset classes (such as ESG bonds).
These SSPs are related to one of the three SPs. They
are developed by the Sustainability Expertise Centre
(SEC). The SEC keeps in touch with external parties
including NGOs, other financial institutions, academics,
politicians and the media. The SEC also prepares the
Sustainability Policy of ASN Impact Investors.
We distinguish three pillars in our SPs:
climate, biodiversity and human rights. Countries,
organisations and businesses are assessed based on
these strict sustainability policies. The approach to our
SPs consists of two elements: 1) a set of sustainability
criteria to exclude or avoid investments that have a
negative impact and 2) a set of criteria to support
investments that contribute to sustainability. Below we
elaborate on the two elements of our approach for
each pillar (climate, biodiversity and human rights).
Human rights
We have a wide range of policies to avoid violations of
human rights in our loan and investment portfolios.
We do not invest in companies that engage in or
profit from war or armed conflict. We cannot and
will not reconcile ourselves with the idea that these
types of companies benefit from the existence of,
and increase in armed conflicts. This implies that
we also refrain from every form of financing of or
investment in companies involved in the development,
maintenance, testing, storage and distribution of
weapons. Examples of criteria to support investments
that uphold collective, human and labour rights are:
equal treatment, no forced or child labour, safe and
healthy working conditions, and respecting the rights
of local communities and indigenous people. For
further details on these policies, see our Human Rights
Policy.
Climate
Climate change is one of the most pressing problems
the world is facing at the moment. In order to mitigate
the impact on climate change, our sustainability
criteria avoid involvement in entities that have a
negative impact on climate change and support
investments that contribute to combating climate
change. Activities we refuse to invest in are, for
instance, the exploration, extraction and production of
fossil fuels and electricity generation by means of fossil
fuels. For details on these policies, see our Climate
policy. In order to adapt to the impact of climate
change we strive for a ‘climate-neutral balance sheet
by 2030’ and use this initiative to advocate climate
neutrality in the rest of the financial services sector.
Biodiversity
We aim to reduce the ecological impact from our
loans and investments by analysing whether potential
loans and investments meet our strict sustainability
criteria. Our criteria for biodiversity are in line with
the main threats concerning the loss of nature
and biodiversity: land use and nature deterioration;

overexploitation; climate change; invasive and exotic
species; and pollution. For further details on these
policies, see our Biodiversity Policy. At the same time
we are enhancing biodiversity by investing in, i.a.
biodiversity conservation, renewable energy and the
circular economy. When the positive effect we achieve
on biodiversity with our loans and investments is
greater than our negative impact, we have achieved
our long-term goal: to have a net positive impact on
biodiversity in 2030.
Closely linked to this policy is our policy on Circular
Economy, which includes our vision on the circular
economy and in which less and more efficient use
of both renewable and non-renewable raw materials
takes centre stage.
Level 4 Applied Sustainability Policies (ASPs)
The ASPs specify how specific policies are
implemented in various processes. Thus, compared
with other policies that deal with the 'why' and 'how',
these policies have a more practical approach, i.e.
'what to do'. The SEC closely cooperates with the
relevant departments in developing these ASPs. Final
responsibility of implementing these more operational
policies lies with the relevant departments. Besides
providing support or advice on implementation, the
SEC supports these departments in formulating and
achieving the related objectives. If necessary, the SEC
can also provide training on the sustainability policies
or specific sustainability topics to the departments.
This is in addition to the sustainability learning path
in the internal learning platform (Learning Experience
Platform) that covers the Sustainability House of
Policies as well.
Procurement policy
Responsible procurement and contracting
Sustainable procurement is good for the environment and can save money. We therefore check products and services to be purchased
in terms of their CO2 emissions, useful life and circular use. We have a Procurement policy that is applicable to approximately 3,000
suppliers. When selecting suppliers, we take their sustainability criteria into account. We not only take a close look at suppliers'
sustainability policies, but also to the environmental and social aspects involved in the development of their products and services.
All purchase agreements are based on de Volksbank's Terms and Conditions of Purchase. We also expect our suppliers to sign our
Sustainability Statement, which contains our terms and conditions with regard to corporate responsibility. The statement is based on
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the OECD guidelines, the UN Global Compact and the core conventions of the International
Labour Organization (ILO). In addition to subscribing to these international guidelines, we ask suppliers to meet our preconditions
on business attitude, transparency, value chain responsibility and innovation. For example, our suppliers shall be transparent and
clear about the use of products, services and the corresponding conditions. Potential misconduct, specifically related to people or the
environment, that is related to our own business activities or those of partners in the supply chain is also continuously examined as
well as monitored. In case of any abuse, we directly engage with relevant and affected stakeholders about the measures taken and
their subsequent results. We approach the relevant stakeholder and engage in a conversation to set up an agreement for action. If
the stakeholder cannot live up to this agreement, or if we see insufficient improvement, we can decide to withdraw as an investor or
financier. A more detailed description can be found on our website.
Supplier engagement
We regularly engage with our key suppliers. We meet with them and discuss the status and progress of our relationship, usually one to
four times a year. For these suppliers, we draw up a Service Level Agreement (SLA) describing the requirements for the products and
services provided, including sustainability aspects such as ISO 14001 certification. De Volksbank also appreciates feedback on its own
responsible business activities. Stakeholders are, for example, asked to provide feedback on possible adverse effects resulting from our
activities.

COMMITMENTS
Our commitment to voluntary and mandatory
initiatives and transparent disclosure adds a layer
of accountability to our business activities and
performance. Below we present a selection of the
voluntary, non-binding initiatives and mandatory
codes. All our brands engage in various other
initiatives and commitments; for the full list and latest
updates, see our website (in Dutch only).
Mandatory
Codes
Explanation
 
Banking Code The Banking Code contains principles for better risk management and a responsible remuneration policy at banks.
The Banking Code focuses on the customers’ interests and contributes to the stability of the Dutch economy. The
Banking Code applies as from 1 January 2010 and is legally embedded. Banks are therefore obliged to account for
compliance with the Code in their annual reports using the comply or explain principle.
Corporate
Governance Code
Dutch rules of conduct are legally embedded for listed companies. The rules enforce good governance protecting
the interests of shareholders, employees and other stakeholders.

Voluntary, non-binding
initiatives
Explanation
 
International Labour
Organisation (ILO)
The ILO was established in 1919 and brings together governments, employers and workers of 187 member
states to set labour standards, develop policies and devise programmes that promote decent work for all men
and women. It is the only tripartite UN agency.
Organisation for
Economic Cooperation
and Development
(OECD)
The OECD is an intergovernmental economic organisation and forum with 38 member countries, founded in
1961 to stimulate economic progress and world trade. The OECD guidelines form the starting point for the
Dutch international CSR policy, which provides tools for companies to deal with issues such as supply chain
responsibility, human rights, child labour, the environment and corruption.
International
Responsible Business
Conduct Agreement
(IMVO Bankenconvenant)
At the end of 2017, de Volksbank signed the ICSR Banking Sector Covenant, together with the NVB, other
financial institutions, the government, trade unions and non-governmental organisations. Through this
covenant we agreed to reduce the risk of human rights violations. Since the end of 2021, the banks have
formally adopted the Responsible Business Conduct Commitment as a follow up to the RBC agreement (ICSR
Covenant). 
ICMA Green Bond
Principles
Green Bonds enable capital raising and investment for new and existing projects that benefit the
environment. The ICMA Green Bond Principles (GBP) are voluntary process guidelines that recommend
transparency and disclosure and promote integrity in the development of the Green Bond market by clarifying
the way in which Green Bonds should be issued.
Equator Principles The Equator Principles is a risk management framework adopted by financial institutions. It is intended to
determine, assess and manage environmental and social risks in project financing.
UN Global Compact A UN initiative to encourage companies worldwide to implement sustainable and socially responsible policies
and to report on their implementation.
Principles for
Responsible Banking
The Principles for Responsible Banking are a unique framework for ensuring that signatory banks’ strategies
and practices are in line with the vision it has set for the future in the Sustainable Development Goals
and the Paris Climate Agreement. There are 6 business-related principles: alignment, impacts, customers,
stakeholders, governance & culture, transparency & accountability. Read more in Section Principles for
Responsible Banking.
The Dutch National
Climate Agreement
A financial sector led initiative to contribute to the implementation of the Paris Agreement and the Climate
Agreement. The commitment is directed at the provision of suitable market-based financing arrangements
for sustainability, and to the integration of climate targets, including CO2 reduction targets in companies’ own
strategies. In 2022 we published our Climate Action Plan, as part of our contribution to the Dutch National
Climate Agreement.
The Science-Based
Targets initiative (SBTi)
The SBTi drives ambitious climate action in the private sector by enabling companies to set science-based
targets for emission reductions. Targets to reduce GHG emissions are considered 'science-based' when they
are aligned with the latest requirements to meet the Paris Climate Agreement. De Volksbank is the first bank
in the Netherlands with approved Science Based Targets (SBT) for our scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.
Finance for Biodiversity
Pledge
Signatories pledge to the protection and restoration of biodiversity by: 1) Cooperation and sharing of
knowledge; 2) Joint commitment of companies; 3) Calculating impact on biodiversity; 4) Setting targets; 5)
Publicly reporting on the above no later than 2024.
Financial Health &
Inclusion Commitment
The PRB Commitment to Financial Health and Inclusion is a commitment to promote universal financial
inclusion and foster a banking sector that supports the financial health of customers. Launched in December
2021, the commitment is a collective journey to accelerate action on financial health and inclusion – one of the
top three sustainability challenges identified by signatory banks in the 2020 PRB Collective Progress Report, as
where they can have the most impact.
The National Financial
Health Coalition
Both public and private organisations work together to improve the financial health among citizens of the
Netherlands. A financially healthy society contributes to the well-being of individuals, organisations, the
economy and thus our society. The aim of this commitment is to halve the number of households that are
financially inadequate or financially unhealthy by 2030.
FEEDBACK MECHANISMS
Complaints
Mostly due to process optimisation, we saw the
number of complaints drop in the years 2019 -
2021. In 2022 though, we saw the number of
complaints increase substantially to 10,012 (for all
brands) compared to 8,310 in 2021. This was mainly
caused by the introduction of a fixed fee for the
basic banking package7, and by the newly introduced
7 This package combines several day-to-day banking activities
such as payments, savings and our personal services and
was introduced as of 1 July 2022 for SNS and RegioBank
customers and as of 1 October 2022 for ASN Bank
costs for business customers. These new costs are
introduced due to necessary customer research. This
type of research is needed to avoid financial criminality
as much as possible and to contribute to a safe and
stable financial system.
The complexity of complaints is increasing. The
procedure to open a business bank account as a
business owner is more complicated and therefore
requires longer processing times, resulting in more
complaints. Every month, both the leadership teams
customers. Customers pay a fixed monthly fee for this
package no matter what product they have.

of the various brands and the ExCo discuss the trends
and developments in customer complaints. Every year,
the Complaints Manager is invited to an ExCo meeting
to provide an update of the past year.
We actively involve customers and consumers in
the development of new concepts and test our
online and offline communications. We continuously
measure customer satisfaction and receive customer
experiences, opinions and suggestions on a daily basis.
We bundle this feedback and use it as input to
make improvements. All feedback, whether or not it
concerns a complaint, is recorded and analysed. If a
customer makes a complaint, one of our employees
will contact the customer in question, either in the
shop or by telephone. The employee handling the
complaint aims for a careful, verifiable and consistent
complaints procedure. The employee is given the time
and, if necessary, resources to do so. If it turns out that
de Volksbank has made a mistake and the customer
has suffered damage as a result of this, the latter will
be compensated.
Mechanisms for seeking advice and raising
concerns
Any concerns about the organisation's unethical
or unlawful behaviour may be voiced through the
regular processes and procedures of incident and loss
management as well as through the whistleblowing
procedure. A well-spread network of confidants
offers staff the opportunity to raise concerns about
malpractices. The annually recurring ‘Integrity in the
Organization’ culture questionnaire (IO) shows that the
employees are familiar with the content of the Code
of Conduct and they know where to find the Code
of Conduct. In general, de Volksbank employees are
motivated to comply with the Code of Conduct and
experience that their leader acts in line with the Code.
Next, most employees agree with the content of the
Code of Conduct and they are aware of the risk for
the company in case their behaviour is not in line with
the Code. According to some employees it is easy to
circumvent the Code of Conduct.
MEMBERSHIP ASSOCIATIONS AND COLLABORATIONS
We are aware that the positive change we envision
requires partnerships and collaboration within and
outside of the financial sector. Being de Volksbank, we
aim to initiate, accelerate and facilitate partnerships to
achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on
various topics. For us, this is part of our commitment
to contribute to SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals.
Read more about our contribution to the SDGs in our
Annual Review 2022. The following are some examples
of our collaboration with stakeholders.
Dutch Debt Relief Route (NSR)
Dutch Debt Relief Route (Nationale Schuldhulp
Route) is a public-private partnership of companies,
municipalities, (aid) agencies and other cooperation
partners. Together they work towards a financially
strong and stable country. They do this by finding and
guiding people and companies with financial worries
to the help they need at an early stage. If worries have
grown into debts, NSR guides these people to (debt)
assistance.
Money Wise
The Money Wise Platform was launched by the
Ministry of Finance to improve the financial fitness
of Dutch citizens. In order to achieve this, partners
from government, financial services industry, NGO’s
and academia collaborate in the platform.
MVO Nederland
Corporate Social Responsibility Netherlands (MVO
Nederland) is the movement for entrepreneurs in the
New Economy. New Economy develops products and
services that contribute to the climate solution. This
economy is climate neutral, circular, and inclusive with
fair supply chains. It has created a network of partners
who implement innovations in order to attain a future-
proof New Economy. Entrepreneurs can continue to
act as entrepreneurs.
Volunteering platform NLvoorelkaar
NLvoorelkaar is the largest Dutch volunteering
platform, where the supply and demand meet. This
platform, on which 180,000 participants, 65 local
platforms, 55 participating municipalities and 11,000
social organisations are active, can make an even
bigger impact. Starting from our social role, we want
to expand this group of volunteers even more. Our
employees were allowed to take special leave with
pay for volunteering, with a length of maximum three
times the average number of working hours per day in
2022.
Orange Fund
The Orange Fund (Oranje Fonds) is a Dutch foundation
based in Utrecht that provides funds to foundations
and associations to strengthen the social aspects of
society. RegioBank and the Orange Fund have a joint
fund (VoordeBuurt Fonds) that supports social initiatives
that promote a sense of community among people
and the quality of life in communities. Every year, the
Orange Fund supports around 10,000 social projects
across the Netherlands and the Caribbean part of the
Kingdom.
Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF)
PCAF is a global partnership of financial institutions
that work together to develop and implement a
harmonised, transparent and uniform approach to
measure and disclose the greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions associated with loans and investments. The
approach entails a carbon accounting methodology
and provides financial institutions with a starting point
to set science-based targets and align their portfolio
with the Paris Climate Agreement. The initiative for
the PCAF was led by ASN Bank in 2015 and has since
grown into a global initiative. As at year-end 2022, 350+
financial institutions, representing over $ 87 trillion,
are already committed to measuring and disclosing
financed emissions using the PCAF methodology.
De Volksbank is a member of the steering group of
PCAF Global and of multiple working groups within
PCAF Netherlands.

Partnership for Biodiversity Accounting Financials (PBAF)
The Partnership for Biodiversity Accounting Financials
(PBAF) was initiated in November 2019 by ASN Bank
together with 5 founding partners ACTIAM, FMO,
Robeco, Triodos Bank and Triple Jump. PBAF's
primary aim is to develop the ‘PBAF Standard’,
enabling financial institutions to assess and disclose
impact and dependencies on biodiversity of loans
and investments. PBAF provides practical guidance
to financial institutions on biodiversity impact and
dependency assessment and defines what is needed in
order for these assessments (either or not conducted
by data providers) to deliver the right information to
financial institutions. With this information financial
institutions can effectively manage and report on
biodiversity related risks and opportunities and
contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of
biodiversity. After establishing a separate foundation
in 2021, the PBAF foundation formed a complete
board and a diverse sounding board consisting of
global stakeholders in 2022. The PBAF initiative grew
to 47 financial institutions representing 13 countries.
Platform Living Wage Financials (PLWF)
Under the umbrella of PLWF, financial institutions
come together to encourage, support, assess, and
monitor investee companies with regard to their
commitment to enable the payment of living wage to
the workers in their supply chains. As recognised by
the International Labour Organization (ILO), OECD and
others, a living wage is a fundamental human right.
Within PLWF, we are strongly convinced that a living
wage is a salient human right that requires urgent
attention by companies worldwide. PLWF was founded
by ASN Bank, Triodos Bank IM and financial service
provider MN.
In 2022, PLWF grew into a coalition of 19 investors
with over € 6.5 billion (year-end 2021: € 4.6 billion) of
assets under management. The PLWF is in dialogue
with 34 garment companies, out of these companies
15 companies fall within the ASN Investment Universe.
All 34 companies are assessed every year and this
assessment on living wage shows that even though
some companies made progress, the overall progress
on the topic of living wage remains slow. The
15 companies that fall within the ASN Investment
Universe are ranked as follows: Leaders (0), Advanced
(2), Maturing (10), Developing (3), Embryonic (0).
Three companies improved their score enough to
be categorised in a higher category. For example,
Kontoor, which was categorised as Embryonic in 2021,
is now categorised as Developing. Coats moved from
Developing to Maturing and Puma showed progress
as well, by moving from Maturing to Advanced.
The remaining 12 companies remained in the same
category as in 2021.
The above reflects the progress we made together with
the other PLWF coalition partners on the KPI Living
wage: de Volksbank wants all garment companies
in the ASN Investment Universe to fall into the
category Leaders by 2030. The number of companies
in the universe may change over the years; in 2022,
15 companies were included. The procedures for
inclusion in the universe are explained in detail in
the prospectus that can be found here. In 2022, we
did not invest in all of the 15 companies included
in the universe, we did however actively engage with
all of them. We did so through the PLWF, as we
can increase our leverage on investee companies by
acting in concert with PLWF members. The previously
mentioned annual assessment is followed by an
engagement call in which not only the results are
discussed, but also the areas for improvement and
the expectations we have. Furthermore, the garment
companies are invited to the PLWF annual event and in
2022 guidance was published on how these companies
can meet the assessment criteria.
The PLWF and de Volksbank recognise that changes
in the garment industry cannot only be attributed to
the PLWF activities, other initiatives are needed too
to achieve for example developments in laws and
regulations. More details on the engagement by the
PLWF and the developments in the ASN Investment
Universe can be found in the Annual Report PLWF
2022.
Platform Woningverbeteraars
De Volksbank was the initiator of the platform
Woningverbeteraars (home improvers). Together with
its partners, de Volksbank created this web page,
where consumers can find information on how to
make their home more sustainable.
The Dutch Banking Association
The Dutch Banking Association (NVB) strives to achieve
a strong, healthy and internationally competitive
banking system for Dutch and foreign banks and credit
institutions operating in the Netherlands. NVB is the
link between the banking sector, the government and
the public and contributes to a vital and sustainable
sector.
TIBER & TMNL
Organisations in the financial sector are collaborating
to be more resistant to cyber attacks. This takes
place within the TIBER-NL programme, which is led
by the Cyber Unit of De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB).
TIBER stands for Threat Intelligence Based Ethical
Red-teaming. In addition, Dutch banks have joined
forces under the name Transactie Monitoring Nederland
(TMNL). Together, they are fighting financial crime by
jointly monitoring the banks' payment transactions for
signals that could indicate money laundering and/or
financing of terrorism.
Dutch National Homeowners Association (VEH) &
National Mortgage Guarantee (NHG)
In 2022, we actively sought collaboration with
stakeholders such as VEH and NHG in order
to follow up on the pilot for high-rent tenants.
The Dutch National Homeowners Association,
Vereniging Eigen Huis, is a Dutch organisation for private
individuals who own or want to own a home. The
National Mortgage Guarantee, Nationale Hypotheek
Garantie, offers a safety net in case someone can no
longer pay the mortgage. Other smaller stakeholders
on this topic were The Great National Housing Debate,
Platform Mortgages and the Monitor for First-time

on biodiversity and want to learn how to integrate
biodiversity into their operations and strategies.
The EU Business@Biodiversity platform
This platform provides a forum for dialogue and policy
interface to discuss the links between business and
biodiversity at EU level. It was set up by the European
Commission with the aim to work with and help
businesses measure and integrate the value of nature
into business practices.
Biodiversity Working Group of the Platform for
Sustainable Finance of the Dutch Central Bank
The Working Group on Biodiversity consists of eight
financial institutions and two other organisations. Its
members are Actiam, APG, ASN Bank, a.s.r., FMO, ING,

Value Creation. It is headed by Lidwin van Velden,
Chair of NWB Bank's Executive Committee.
2.2.5 Stakeholder engagement
We proactively and responsibly engage with our
stakeholders by involving them in what we do and by
working together. The table shows a selection of the
dialogues held by us, the topics discussed, stakeholder
expectations and they way we responded to them. The

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT FOR OUR FOUR BRANDS
It is important to listen, engage and collaborate with
our stakeholders in order to effectively create value
for them. We study the perceptions and attitudes
towards de Volksbank as a company or as an employer
through market research and our employee surveys
respectively. In addition, we learn to understand what
our stakeholders' most meaningful topics are by
conducting a materiality assessment. As we engage
with our stakeholders in many different ways all year
round, we would like to give an impression of our
stakeholder engagement by means of the following
four examples of our four brands:
Topic & Stakeholder
SNS: Youth Council   MT2
Dialogue Response Follow-up
To encourage equal 
growth opportunities 
for everyone, we 
engaged with young 
adults through a 
Youth Council. The 
goal of this council is 
to talk to young adults 
about their personal 
growth barriers, their 
expectations of a bank 
and the way in which 
we can help.
The youth council is 
held on a  quarterly 
 basis. During 
these interactive 
 sessions, two SNS 
 specialists and a  
number of other  
 employees talk to a 
group of some eight 
young adults to gain 
new insights.
These dialogues 
have given us several 
insights. An important 
one being that young 
adults often feel 
they are neglected 
by/not visible for 
banks. Through these 
dialogues, we want to 
give young adults a 
voice and make them 
feel heard.
In 2023, we aim for 
a youth council with 
a fixed composition. We 
also want to provide 
feedback on action 
points and test new 
products and services.
Topic & Stakeholder Dialogue Response Follow-up
We engage with 
international 
stakeholders 
including civil society 
organisations such as 
Fashion Revolution and 
Fair Wear Foundation. 
Experts on living wages 
in the garment sector 
and on European policy 
processes are also 
involved.
To place living wage 
higher on the agenda, 
we have regular meet-
ings in  different  settings 
aimed at setting 
up a European 
 Citizen’s Committee 
that is to draw up a 
proposal to demand 
legislation from the 
European Commission 
for clothing brands 
and retailers in the 
garment industry alike 
to conduct specific 
due diligence in their 
supply chain to ensure 
workers are paid living 
wages.
A European Citizen’s 
Committee has been 
set up, consisting of 
15 citizens from 10 
different EU countries. 
The committee 
submitted the 
legislative proposal 
to the European 
Commission and is now 
responsible for getting 
1 million signatures of 
EU citizens supporting 
the proposal.
An ASN Bank 
employee sits on the 
Citizen’s Committee 
and collaborates with a 
continuously growing 
number of stakeholders 
throughout Europe 
in order to reach the 
one million signatures 
required for the 
proposal to be put 
on the official agenda 
of the European 
Commission.

Topic & Stakeholder Dialogue Response Follow-up
Social encounters 
and facilities make 
smaller communities 
liveable. In this respect, 
the government is an 
important stakeholder. 
Therefore, RegioBank  
actively seeks 
cooperation with the 
government in the 
‘Together against 
loneliness’ programme 
to facilitate social 
encounters and 
facilities for the elderly. 
Other stakeholders in 
these ‘coalitions’ are 
local entrepreneurs, 
care institutions, 
residents, clubs and 
foundations.
The Dutch Ministry of 
Health, Welfare and 
Sport has launched 
a national programme 
to fight loneliness 
together. Part of this 
programme is a local 
approach for munici-
palities to collaborate 
with entrepreneurs, 
clubs, foundations and 
other institutions in 
coalitions. Being a local 
bank, RegioBank takes 
part in these coalitions 
and not only identifies 
loneliness, but also con-
tributes to solutions. In 
time, these coalitions 
will have a broader 
scope.
By participating in 
these coalitions, 
Independent Advisers 
collect information on 
the social well-being of 
community residents. 
Together with the 
coalition partners, this 
makes it easier to jointly 
realise initiatives that 
make the community 
more liveable and 
creates a stage for 
financial education in 
all Dutch regions.
In 2023, more 
Independent Advisers 
will join existing 
coalitions to facilitate 
even more social 
encounters and 
facilities.
RegioBank: Together against loneliness   MT8  
Topic & Stakeholder Dialogue Response Follow-up
More than half a million 
Dutch people have a 
hard time getting a 
mortgage. There are 
people who pay high 
rents, but still do not 
qualify for a mortgage 
because the current 
requirements are that 
stringent. The average 
high-rent tenant spends 
more than 40% of his/
her income on housing.
People who have paid 
high rents for a period 
of at least three years 
are eligible for the 
high-rent ( Duurhuur) 
pilot. The potential 
mortgage customer and 
our financial adviser 
will, in an in-person 
consultation, explore 
the possibilities of 
getting a mortgage.
The pilot has attracted 
politicians’ and media 
attention at a national 
level, creating a great 
deal of support for the 
pilot. Financial advisers 
are very happy with the 
pilot and rewarded it 
with the “Gouden Lotus 
Award”, a Dutch price 
for initiatives in the 
financial sector.
The pilot has been 
scaled up to include 
more financial 
institutions. By scaling 
up, we are able to reach 
and help more people 
who have a hard time 
buying a home.

2.3 Material topics
2.3.1 Our materiality assessment
In order to effectively create value for our
stakeholders, it is important to understand the
topics that are meaningful to them. We study the
perceptions and attitudes towards de Volksbank as
a company or as an employer through market
research and employee surveys. Another way to
engage with our stakeholders is by means of the
materiality assessment. Every other year, we carry
out a comprehensive analysis on the most material
topics for our stakeholders, in the intermediate year
we validate and evaluate the accuracy of these topics
and our process, 2022 was an intermediate year. The
materiality assessment is conducted in line with the
GRI.
DOUBLE MATERIALITY
We have taken steps to bring our risk assessment
closer to the materiality assessment and we will
continue to do so in the years to follow. Conventional
risk assessments tend to look at potential impacts
stemming from external events (outside-in impact),
which is different from the perspective of the
materiality assessment (inside-out impact). These
diverging perspectives on risks stemming from the
same phenomenon is called double materiality.

THE COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS: THE PROCESS OF
ASSESSING MATERIAL TOPICS
The materiality assessment is carried out by
a designated working group, consisting of
representatives from various departments within
de Volksbank. This team coordinates the process and
evaluates the results. The outcomes of the assessment
are reviewed by the Social Impact Committee (SIC) and
approved by the Executive Board (ExBo). The process
starts with a non-exhaustive and broad longlist of
topics that could be material to our stakeholders.
We then use internal and external documentation
to narrow down the longlist to a shortlist. Internal
sources include: previous reports, strategy and policy
documents of de Volksbank. External sources include:
trend reports, covenants and regulations, media and
peer analyses. The most recurrent topics will be
shortlisted. The shortlist is then validated by internal
experts.
The next step is a validation and prioritisation
through a survey among internal and external
stakeholders. The internal stakeholders comprises
experts from various departments, including senior-
level management. They are asked to assess and rank
the potential impact of de Volksbank on these topics.
The external stakeholders, comprising customers,
employees, public partners and our shareholder, are
asked which topic they think should be most important
to de Volksbank. During these talks the contribution of
de Volksbank to the SDGs were discussed. For more
information about these stakeholders, see Section
2.2.5 Stakeholder engagement. The outcomes of the
internal and external prioritisation are presented in the
materiality matrix in the next section. The horizontal
axis shows the outcomes of the internal survey, and
the vertical axis shows the outcomes of the external
survey.

THE INTERMEDIATE YEAR: VALIDATION AND
EVALUATION
In 2022, an intermediate year, we validated and
evaluated the accuracy of these topics and our process
to do so. In order to report in accordance with
GRI 3 Material Topics 2021 Standard, we engaged
with internal experts on each material topic to
identify on a high-level overview the actual and
the potential, negative and positive impacts on the
economy, environment and people. Both across our
own activities and through our business relationships.
For the results of the impacts for each material topic,
see Section 2.4 Topic-specific disclosures or, for an
overview, see Section 2.3.3 Management of material
topics.
In 2022, we specifically focussed on deepening
our knowledge on society as a stakeholder. For
this purpose, we initiated a research project in
collaboration with Solve Consultancy to verify our
understanding of this stakeholder group and their
expectations towards de Volksbank. The research
confirmed our previously held views of the large and
diverse group of our most relevant stakeholders and
their interests.
In addition to the study of society as a stakeholder
group, our internal risk experts specifically evaluated
the outside-in impact of our material topics. As a
starting point, they used the most material topics of
last year's materiality analysis. They used the results
of the internal strategic risk analysis, performed in
early 2022, to determine which of the most material
topics have a high material risk. We do not yet
have an integrated process or materiality analysis
which is fully in line with the double materiality
principles. Our intention is to further improve this
evaluation into an integrated process. Nevertheless,
this marks an important step towards solidifying the
double materiality perspective into our organisation.
The results of this outside-in impact perspective are
presented in Section 2.3.2 Material topics and for
explanations per material topic, see Section 2.4 Topic-
specific disclosures.

to disclose information on the remaining 10 topics as
well. Read more about these topics in Section 2.5.1
Other material topics. We monitor most of the material
topics by tracking the progress on relevant indicators,
most of which are Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

2.4 Topic-specific disclosures
2.4.1 Fair, transparent and sustainable
products
 MT1
We continuously work on understandable and
transparent products and services that put customers'
interests first. We strive for products and services that
cause as little harm as possible to nature and the
environment.
OUTSIDE-IN IMPACT
The two risk types associated with this material topic
are reputational risk and compliance risk. As far
as reputational risk is concerned, the norms and
standards of our society, shareholder and our own
organisation are constantly changing. To mitigate this
risk, we continuously have to adjust our products and
services to these changes. With regard to compliance
risk, it is important that our employees embody our
culture of prioritising customer interest and market
integrity to ensure that we offer fair, transparent and
sustainable products. Based on an internal strategic
risk analysis we determined this material topic does
not have a high material risk.
INSIDE-OUT IMPACT
De Volksbank aims to create a positive social impact
by offering socially relevant propositions and providing
fair, transparent and sustainable products. We can
make a potential positive impact through our products
by giving out a loan to customers to make their home
more sustainable or by giving advice to entrepreneurs.
Some of our products may have an indirect negative
impact through our business relationships. The main
identified negative impact is on the environment due
to mortgages we provide for houses with a low energy
efficiency rating. Read more about this in Section 2.4.6
Material Topic 6: Climate impact.
MANAGEMENT OF THE IMPACT
New products and services, and any changes
thereto, go through the Product Approval and Review
Process (PARP). We want to enter into sustainable
customer relationships and create shared value for
our customers, society, employees and shareholder.
To weigh up these values, we always balance
the interests in a demonstrable and fair way as
part of the PARP . Part of the PARP are the so-
called ‘CUSU’ criteria developed by the Netherlands
Authority for the financial markets (AFM). CUSU stands
for the standards Cost effective, Useful, Safe and
Understandable. These criteria reflect the way in which
we balance the interests of our stakeholders. For
example, the Cost effective criteria are set up from
the customers' perspective: products and services
provided should be reasonably priced. We think this
is one aspect that reflects our fair products. Another
part of the PARP is used to check if the potential
negative impacts related to products and services
are acceptable to our brands and customers before
they are launched. In 2021 we have taken the first
steps towards securing sustainability in our PARP
as another part of the process. In 2022 these first
steps became more concrete, we formulated a plan
to add sustainability criteria. In December 2022 two
sustainability criteria were approved and the phase-
in date for these two criteria is 1 February 2023.
The Product Approval and Review Committee (PARC)
is responsible for approving new - and changes to
existing - products of all of de Volksbank's brands.
Members on the PARC include the directors of the
Legal, Risk and Compliance departments and the
committee is chaired by the Chief Customer Officer
(CCO).
We also check if our products and services comply with
external legal requirements and our own policies. The
aim of our sustainability policies and commitments is
to both increase our positive impact and minimise our
negative impact. For more information on our policies
and commitments, see Section 2.2.4 Strategy, policies
and practices.
In order to track the effectiveness of our impacts we
measure the Net Promoter Score, the number of active
multi-customers and the Customer Relationship Score.
These KPIs indicate if customers recommend us to
others, the number of products they use and if they
trust us. We consider thiese as relevant indicators
to track the effectiveness of the progress we made
on fair, transparent and sustainable products. More
information on the progress on these KPIs can be
found in Section 1.3 Our strategic progress.
In 2022 we published our Climate Action Plan (CAP) as
part of our contribution to the Dutch Financial Sector
Climate Commitment. In the CAP we define, among
other things, our ambition for a net zero balance sheet
in 2050 and our commitment to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions from the residential mortgage portfolio.
We aim to reassess all product and service proposals
of the last couple of years with the aim to support
our retail mortgage customers in reducing their energy
consumption and GHG emissions of their homes by
providing them with loans and advice. Besides that,
we found that relatively small adjustments in the
credit position of a customer, e.g. to invest in energy-
savings solutions, can lead to a disproportionate
administrative burden, partly due to strict regulations.
Together with our peers we will engage with legislators
and supervisory authorities to seek appropriate
solutions in this respect. To realise our ambition we
will more precisely assess the required actions in 2023.
Finally, our advisers and customer service employees
engage with customers on a daily basis. We aim
to consult stakeholders in society in the creation
of our new products and services. For more
information on how we engage and examples of
topics, stakeholder expectations and activities, see
Section 2.2.5 Stakeholder engagement.
2.4.2 Customer relationship and service
 MT2
We strive to help customers in the best possible
way, not only by responding to their questions or
complaints, but also by providing them with proactive
solutions.

OUTSIDE-IN IMPACT
The risk type associated with this material topic is
business risk. Not realising customer-related promises
and/or strategic goals may lead to a decrease in
customer satisfaction, which in turn may lead to a
loss of customers. Based on an internal strategic risk
analysis we determined this material topic does not
have a high material risk.
INSIDE-OUT IMPACT
Each of our four brands has its own way of
communicating with their customers. Through our
brands, we have nationwide coverage, which means
that there is always a branch or shop nearby where
customers can go for personal advice. Furthermore,
we can achieve positive impact by helping customers
with their financial health and financial inclusion,
for example with 'Eurowijs' financial education and
informing customers on how to save money. We
also have an online Home improvement platform
(Woningverbeteraars), a service towards our customers
to help them make their homes more sustainable. We
may have a negative impact on people and society
through our customer relationship and services, for
example when customers are dissatisfied or when we
make a mistake in our services.
MANAGEMENT OF THE IMPACT
We actively involve customers and consumers in
the development of new concepts and test our
online and offline communications in order to
improve our positive impacts. We continuously
measure customer satisfaction and receive customer
experiences, opinions and suggestions on a daily basis.
We bundle this feedback and use it as input to
make improvements. All feedback, whether or not it
concerns a complaint, is recorded and analysed. If a
customer makes a complaint, one of our employees
will contact the customer in question, either in one of
our shops or by telephone. The employee handling the
complaint aims for a careful, verifiable and consistent
complaints procedure and is given the time and, if
required, resources to do so. If it turns out that
de Volksbank has made a mistake and the customer
has suffered damage as a result of this, the latter will
be compensated. Besides our complaints procedure,
our sustainability policies includes several criteria
related to customers, including consumer protection.
Read more about our sustainability policies in Section
2.2.4 Strategy, policies and practices.
To measure the customer relationship we defined
three KPIs, i.e. the customer-weighted Net Promoter
Score (NPS), the number of active multi-customers and
the customer-weighted average Customer Relationship
Score (KRS) for more information see Section
Definition and methodology of strategic KPIs. For the
progress on these KPIs see Section 1.3 Our strategic
progress,
The stakeholder with whom we engage most about
this topic is our customer. However, we also cooperate
with several stakeholders in society on topics such as
financial health and inclusion, voluntary work and on
quality of live in the neighbourhood. More information
on how we engage with customers and examples of
topics, stakeholder expectations and activities can be
found in Section 2.2.5 Stakeholder engagement.
2.4.3 Data privacy and security
 MT3
We strive for optimal surveillance of customer,
personal and company data to ensure maximum
privacy and security.
OUTSIDE-IN IMPACT
The two risk types associated with this material topic
are operational and compliance risk. Compliance risk
is the risk that we fail to comply with data privacy and
security regulations. To mitigate this risk, we need to
ensure that we carefully protect (customer) data and
are transparent about it. Operational risk is the risk
that our systems and/or the availability of our systems
do not work properly due to a data breach and/or
hack. Based on an internal strategic risk analysis we
determined this material topic has a high material risk.
INSIDE-OUT IMPACT
We make a positive impact by offering our customers
data privacy and protection training courses, for
example on the subject of phishing mails. Besides
that, we continue to enhance compliance with the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to secure
the protection of data and privacy of our customers
and employees. To ensure our customer data is
protected and safe, we have secure data management
systems. We also enable our customers to easily
control/manage their personal data. For example by
actively asking for permission when administrating
their data, and by being transparent about our cookie
policy.
Potential negative impacts through our own activities
occur in case of a data breach that includes personal
data and/or company data. We have included the latter
as a breach of company data might have a negative
indirect effect on customers. This may, in turn, cause
customers’ and society’s trust in de Volksbank to
decrease. These potential negative impacts can also
be of reputational and/or economical nature. Potential
negative impacts may occur in case of (1) non-
compliance with the six principles of the GDPR; (2)
lack of transparency in our communication on the
processing of personal data; (3) privacy by design/
default is not applied ; (4) inadequate handling of
a data breach; (5) inadequate application of security
measures; and (6) no or insufficient attention for the
rights of everyone involved in case of, for example, a
data breach.
The six potential scenarios described above also apply
to our business relationships. De Volksbank also
imposes its privacy policies to business relations that
process personal data on our behalf. Because the
negative effects will also impact de Volksbank through
its business relationships.
MANAGEMENT OF THE IMPACT
We have set up a Privacy Policy (in Dutch only) to
manage our positive and negative impacts on this

topic. This policy is divided into different processes,
which, in turn, are divided into work instructions with
regard to data privacy and security. With regard to
commitments, de Volksbank participates in both a
consultation on data privacy with the Dutch Banking
Association, and an interbank round table with the
data privacy officers of several Dutch banks. We have
also set up an internal Information Security Policy that
describes how we protect the personal data of de
Volksbank and our customers. Next to the data privacy
and protection training courses we offer, we also try to
manage our positive impact by improving our internal
system to enhance our customer service.
We aim to minimise our negative impact with regard
to data privacy and security by drawing up policies
that lay down rules and standards to which the
whole organisation and our business relations have
to adhere. The policies contain action plans in the
event of a data breach and how to engage with
stakeholders. Certain countries are excluded from
doing business with de Volksbank, because of national
laws and regulations on this topic. Apart from
this, our employees are trained in this field. For
example, compliance and security issues are part of
the introduction programme for new employees. To
improve the data security we annually carry out several
security tests, such as pen testing and red teaming,
on various components of our infrastructure. With the
help of ethical hackers, we put both technology and
people to the test, sometimes with advance notice,
sometimes without.
We do not have a specific KPI in place for this
material topic. However, we do monitor data leaks
and the number of privacy related complaints (see the
table on this page). We also have set up a key risk
indicator. This key risk indicator consists of six different
early warning indicators, which relate to a number
of legal requirements with regard to data privacy
and security, including data breaches, the rights of
people involved, records of processing activities, data
protection impact assessment, processing register,
data clearance and compulsory data privacy training
courses. This key risk indicator is part of the risk
appetite for data management. For more information
on the risk appetite, see Section 4.1.3 Risk appetite
and risk indicators. One of the areas for improvement
was creating more support and knowledge with regard
to data privacy throughout all disciplines and lines of
responsibilities. In 2022, we set up a 'Guild' in which
employees from each department have a meeting on
this topic every month. To continue to secure data
privacy at de Volksbank, our employees were trained
by the Privacy Office.
Most of the ways we engage with stakeholders on this
topic have already been mentioned, such as offering
training courses to our customers and awareness
training for employees.
CUSTOMER PRIVACY
Although we have several mitigating policies, actions
and processes in place to minimise data leaks or
complaints about privacy, we consider it important to
monitor these aspects.
We do not yet have the intended indicator for privacy
complaints available. We do consolidate and analyse
all customer complaints. However, privacy-related
complaints are not yet registered in a structured
manner. For example the customer can tick several
subjects on the complaint form to which the complaint
relates. These were complaints where the customers
ticked the subject privacy on the complaint form or
when an employee viewed the complaint as privacy
related. In addition, an employee may not recognise
a complaint as privacy related. Therefore, we aim to
improve the registration of privacy related complaints
and want to create more awareness among employees
to recognise a privacy related complaint in 2023.
The number of data leaks is generally stable
and mainly concerns mail sent to customers' old
addresses. This is explicable because customers
themselves are responsible for changing their address
with the bank. As we have an obligation to inform
customers in writing, the consequence of customers
not informing us of a change of address is that
we send mail to the address known to us. This is
unavoidable.

1 Leaks, thefts or losses of customer data reported by employees. Only
employees can report data leaks into our system, these can be identified

Despite our efforts and training there is an inherent risk of incomplete
incident and privacy complaints reporting. De Volksbank is partially
dependent on information provided by customers and/or employees
recognising and reporting incidents and privacy complaints.

2.4.4 Responsible investment and
financing
 MT4
We incorporate sustainability into all our financing and
investments in order to make a positive impact.
In this section we describe our impacts and
management of the impacts of our project financing
and financial markets investments. See Section 2.4.6
Material topic 6: Climate impact for more information
on the climate impact of our mortgage portfolio.
OUTSIDE-IN IMPACT
The risk type associated with this material topic is
sustainability risk, which means that not realising or
openly communicating about our commitments with
regard to responsible investment and financing could
cause a material negative impact on the bank. As
sustainability risk is often expressed in other risk types,
it may also be considered as a reputational risk. Based

on an internal strategic risk analysis we determined
this material topic does not have a high material risk.
INSIDE-OUT IMPACT
Our mission as a bank is to foster environmental
and social sustainability. We use the money that
our customers entrust to us to promote sustainable
development and to make forward-looking choices,
with respect for people, living creatures and the planet.
We thus help create a world that is safe and healthy
for people to live in, and where the environment
is respected, now and in the future. For example,
we aim to make a positive impact by investing
in affordable housing, education, public transport,
sustainable energy, health care, and in companies
and countries that respect human rights and the
environment.
We consider our negative impact through our own
activities to be relatively small. However, we have
a potential negative impact through our business
relationships. Despite our strict sustainability criteria,
each investment we make or project we finance will
have a certain negative impact on the environment
and biodiversity and perhaps on human rights as
well. Most of these investments will have a short
term actual negative impact and a long term indirect
potential negative impact. We aim to reduce the overall
long term negative impact through our sustainable
investment criteria.
MANAGEMENT OF THE IMPACT
Within the asset class project finance, we try to
manage our positive impacts by considering what type
of projects we finance. Our aim is to finance projects
that have a positive impact on biodiversity and the
climate, while taking human rights in consideration
at the same time. We also finance renewable energy
projects (wind, solar, geothermal, hydrogen) and we
joined a movement to accelerate the development of
biobased buildings.
We aim to minimise our negative impact as much as
possible by setting stringent sustainability criteria for
all our asset classes. For example, we do not invest
in fossil fuels, child labour, the arms industry, nuclear
energy, and countries and companies that violate
human rights.
We check if potential loans and investments meet our
sustainability criteria. Sustainability is the standard: we
apply strict criteria and assess the policy and conduct
of companies and organisations on that basis. Every
other year we assess which countries' government
bonds are eligible for purchase. Read more about
our policy and commitments in Section 2.2.4 Strategy,
policies and practices.
We monitor the progress on our long-term climate
and biodiversity objectives. We want to be climate
neutral by 2030 (see also Section 1.3 Our strategic
progress), to have a net positive effect on biodiversity
by 2030 and we want the garment industry to have all
the processes in place that guarantees workers in its
supply chain a living wage by 2030. We have a zero
tolerance KPI for all our sustainability policies, which
means that all our activities have to comply with the
sustainability criteria for each asset class.
Every other year we select countries that are eligible
for our government bonds portfolio. This year, we
learned that in addition to the current methodology
of assessing countries on exclusion criteria and
sustainability criteria, it can also be very valuable
to assess the current (political) state of countries
and potential malpractices. In 2023, we want to add
this type of assessment in our methodology for
government bonds. Besides that, there is increasing
reference to the EU taxonomy regulation when
assessing green bonds, social bonds and sustainable
bonds. The EU taxonomy regulation is not very specific
on the subject of biomass and not as strict as our
own sustainability policy, which can be found on
our website. The EU taxonomy regulation allows, for
example, natural gas as an investment, while our
sustainability policy excludes this. As a precaution we
exclude bonds that refer only to the EU taxonomy
regulation for biomass, which could result in too few
bonds eligible for approval. As from 2022, we keep
track of how many and which bonds we exclude
under the EU taxonomy regulation, especially biomass
and natural gas. In 2023 we will investigate whether
we want to align our sustainability policy with the
EU taxonomy regulation for biomass. And a final
'lesson learned' for this material topic: due to growing
understanding and given the nitrogen crisis, we have
come to the conclusion that manure fermentation
projects are nos longer sustainable enough for our
project financing portfolio. We are, therefore, going to
adjust this in the sustainability policy in 2023.
Before policies are implemented, relevant
departments within the organisation discuss any such
policy. We also gather input from relevant external
stakeholders, such as NGOs or scientific institutions.
In addition, every relevant internal stakeholder has a
(sustainability) KPI to meet our long-term sustainability
goals on biodiversity and climate. More information on
our partnerships and stakeholder engagement can be
found in Section 2.2.5 Stakeholder engagement.
2.4.5 Responsible financial results
 MT5
We are committed to being a financially healthy bank,
with a solid return and a strong capital position.
OUTSIDE-IN IMPACT
The two risk types associated with this material
topic are business risk and interest rate risk in
the banking book (IRRBB). As far as business
risk is concerned, there are several risk drivers:
macroeconomic conditions, insufficient balance sheet
opportunities to offer long maturities and ineffective
cost management. These may all have a negative
impact on the bank’s financial results. As for the IRRBB,
a low interest rate, as was the case until early 2022,
and a highly competitive environment for mortgages
and savings products may also have a negative impact
on our financial results. With interest rates rising
sharply during 2022, we also clearly see the risk that
high interest rate volatility results in dependence on

the interest income from movements in the money
market rates and actions from peers. As a result,
the stability of the net interest margin decreases and
therefore a main source of profitability is dependent
on external factors. These identified risk drivers are
based on the same analysis that determined that this
material topic has a high material risk.
INSIDE-OUT IMPACT
With a solid capital position, an adequate liquidity
position and a simple and transparent balance sheet,
we contribute to a financially sound and stable bank
with activities that yield stable returns in the long
term. We contribute to economic growth. We facilitate
payment transactions and offer financial services in a
socially responsible way.
However, our profitability may not be sufficient to
guarantee the viability and sustainability of the bank’s
earnings model. Both internal and external factors,
such as developments on financial markets and the
interest rate environment may affect our capability
to generate acceptable revenues. This constitutes
a potential negative impact for our customers,
employees, shareholder and society
De Volksbank aims for optimum total value for
stakeholders rather than maximisation of a single
value. An example of how difficult it can be to aim
for optimum total value is that the introduction of a
fixed fee for the basic banking package for customers
with current and savings accounts had a negative
impact on the relationship with our mono-customers.
This is reflected in the developments of our Net
Promoter Score and Customer Relationship Score,
which decreased on average in 2022.
MANAGEMENT OF THE IMPACT
In order to manage the impact of this topic
we have established policies as part of our
risk management framework and have committed
ourselves to externally disclosed objectives. For more
information on both, see Section 4.3 Credit risk and
Section 1.3 Our strategic progress, respectively.
Considering our ambition of optimising shared
value, we take into account the requirements of
the supervisory authorities, the expectations of
rating agencies and the interests of customers and
investors, while delivering an adequate return for the
shareholder. We also need to meet internal targets
that are consistent with our aim of being a stable bank
with a moderate risk profile and low-risk activities. In
this way, we try to manage our positive impacts.
Business risk management and capital management
are the most relevant in relation to managing
negative impacts for this material topic. In general,
we established indicators for all types of risk,
ensuring that the development of risks is continuously
measured and adjustments are made if necessary.
Business risk is defined as the risk that de Volksbank’s
profitability may not be sufficient to guarantee the
viability and sustainability of the bank’s earnings
model, which is defined as the extent to which the
bank is capable of generating acceptable revenues
over a three-year horizon. The challenges and
opportunities to achieve acceptable revenues, are
addressed in our strategic plan. The primary objective
of capital management is to ensure that the amount of
de Volksbank’s available capital is sufficient to support
our strategy. Our capital requirements are determined
on the basis of the bank’s strategy, risk appetite and
exposures now and in the future.
We have several KPIs in place to track the effectiveness
of delivering responsible financial results, i.e. the
Return on Equity, cost/income ratio, CET1 capital ratio
and the leverage ratio. As part of our strategic plan,
we have set targets for these KPIs, and we externally
communicate our progress on these targets every six
months. Read more about this in Section 1.3 Our
strategic progress.
We engage with various stakeholders on this topic,
including our shareholder, supervisory authorities and
investors. Read more about how we engage with
stakeholders and examples of topics, stakeholder
expectations and activities in Section 2.2.5 Stakeholder
engagement.

FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS AND OTHER RISKS AND
OPPORTUNITIES DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE
For information on risks due to climate change, see
Section 4.9 Sustainability risk.
De Volksbank recognises that, besides risks, that there
are also business opportunities due to climate change.
We introduced a Personal Sustainability Loan, a loan
with an attractive rate that can be used by customers
for sustainable spending. ASN Bank expanded its
product range with sustainable home, contents and
liability insurance. For more information on business
opportunities due to climate change, see Section
Principles for Responsible Banking, principle 3.2.
2.4.6 Climate impact
 MT6
We want to make a positive contribution to the
climate. As a bank, we have a significant (indirect)
impact on the climate, which we measure by means
of our climate-neutral balance sheet.
OUTSIDE-IN IMPACT
The risk type associated with this material topic is
sustainability risk. As described in our risk profile, de
Volksbank’s exposure to sustainability risk primarily
follows from our focus on residential mortgages in
the Netherlands. For example, an increased risk of
flooding leading to a decrease in property values,
can lead to an increase in credit risk. Furthermore,
not realising or openly communicating about our
commitments with regard to responsible investment
and financing could cause a material negative impact

on the bank. Since sustainability risk is often expressed
in other risk types, this may also be considered as a
reputational risk. Based on an internal strategic risk
analysis we determined that this material topic does
not have a high material risk.
INSIDE-OUT IMPACT
Most of our positive impact is achieved through our
investments in sustainable projects, such as projects
related to wind and solar energy, innovative sources
of sustainable energy, storage of all different sources
of sustainable energy and activities contributing to
climate transition. In addition, by supporting our
customers in financing insulation and energy-saving
measures we have an indirect positive impact as well.
The negative impact on the climate through our
own activities is relatively low. The main source of
negative impact is caused by our business operations,
such as commuting and business travel, heating
and furniture and appliances in our buildings. The
majority of our negative impact through business
relationships consists of the issuance of mortgages for
both residential and commercial immovable property,
especially with a low energy efficiency rating.
MANAGEMENT OF THE IMPACT
We mainly manage our (potential) negative impacts
through our strict sustainability policies. We exclude
countries, sectors and businesses that do not meet
our criteria. The aim of our sustainability policies
and commitments in relation to climate impact is
to both increase our positive impact and minimise
our negative impact. Read more about our policies
and commitments in Section 2.2.4 Strategy, policies
and practices. Besides that, we finance homes with
every energy efficiency rating, allowing owners of
homes with a low energy efficiency rating to make
their home more sustainable. We try to minimise the
negative impact of our mortgage portfolio through the
programme Duurzaam Wonen (Sustainable Housing).
We aim to manage our positive impacts by financing
projects that have ‘negative CO2 emissions’, i.e. projects
that remove emissions from the atmosphere, such as
investments aimed at conserving and expanding forest
areas.
In order to track the effectiveness of our climate
impact, we established the KPI climate-neutral balance
sheet which measures our progress towards our goal
of having a climate-neutral balance sheet by 2030.
We have set Science Based Targets for our buildings
and car fleet as well as for our mortgage portfolio
and sustainable energy portfolio. These targets are
ambitious and in accordance with the 1.5oC scenario
in relation to global warming.
In 2022 we published our Climate Action Plan, as
part of our contribution to the Dutch National Climate
Agreement. In our Climate Action Plan we announced
our ambition for a net zero balance sheet in 2050.
We engage with different stakeholders. These
stakeholders consist of customers, advisers,
collaboration partners, businesses, network
organisations and society as a whole. Read more
about how we engage with customers and examples
of topics, stakeholder expectations and activities in
Section 2.2.5 Stakeholder engagement.
EMISSIONS
In this section, we highlight our views on greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions and our role in causing them.
From here onwards, we will generally speak of CO2-
equivalent emissions or just CO2 emissions in short. In
order to understand our impact, it is helpful to think of
3 scopes of emissions, as illustrated in the figure.

Scope 1 & Scope 2
In comparison to all assets on our balance sheet,
our buildings and transportation produce only around
1% of our total CO2 emissions. We do, however,
believe that our sustainability ambition is not credible
without having green business operations. That is why
we strive, year after year, for 100% climate-neutral
business operations.
The emissions from our own business operations
increased compared to last year. Mainly as in 2022 we
went back to the conditions before Covid-19 and our
employees were able to go back to the office more
often. Consequently, we see more travel movements,
both in commuter traffic and business traffic and
flights. As well as an increase of energy consumption
at our offices. We also noticed a decrease in usage of
natural gas and an increase of the usage of district
heating, in line with some of our offices switching from
natural gas to district heating. Detailed CO2e emission,
energy and resource consumption data can be found
in section 2.5.3 Key environmental data of our own
business operations.
Sustainable commuting
In 2022, we leased a total of 217 cars, compared to
360 cars at our reference point at the end of 2016.
We switched to all-electric for all new lease cars as
from 1 January 2017. As from the beginning of 2022,
we no longer offer a lease car to the lowest job grade
(grade 12) that entitles an employee to a lease car
under the company car policy (internal document).
Once all current orders for new lease cars have been
delivered, the lease fleet will be almost entirely electric
(year-end 2022: 84%). Delivery times for new cars are
currently longer than usual. Employees with a lease
car have a pass for charging their car anywhere, at
home, at the office locations or on the road. There
are charging plazas at the office locations and charging
facilities will be provided for those who can charge
their car at home. All employees have an NS Business
Card for business use, including employees with lease
cars. Employees can choose to travel by bicycle, public
transport or by car; this choice can be made every
travel day. The reimbursement rate for the bike is
higher (€ 0.13) than for a car (€ 0.121). The latter
starts from a distance of 10 kilometres. We also offer
a bicycle scheme and provide e-bike charging points in
the bicycle sheds.

Scope 3
The vast majority of GHG emissions fall into the so-
called scope 3 – category 15 emissions (investments),
which are mainly the result of our financing activities.
Our sustainability policy, which can be found on our
website, excludes and avoids financing GHG-intensive
sectors and companies, such as fossil fuel companies.
Nonetheless, our mortgages, corporate loans and
other assets do account for a significant amount of
GHG emissions.
De Volksbank’s balance sheet largely consists of
(residential) mortgages. We understand that housing
has an impact on the climate and that is why
we consider it our responsibility to encourage
homeowners to make their homes energy-efficient,
and why we help them do so. The ASN Bank
Sustainable Finance department (ASN SF) aims to
positively contribute to both our climate change
mitigation goals, i.e. through GHG emission avoidance
and negative CO2 emissions. We are financing several
types of GHG emission-avoiding activities, mainly
within the renewable energy sector. Read more about
our efforts to reduce our scope 3 emissions in our
Climate Action Plan 2022.
We disaggregate and disclose absolute emission data
at sector level in Section 4.9 Sustainability Risk.

Carbon offsetting by Trees for All in Mexico
We offset our CO2 emissions ensuing from internal
business operations by purchasing CO2 credits. Just like
in the past years, we opted for a Trees for All project.
Trees for All has been planting native tree species for
sustainable land use as part of the Scolel’te project
in Mexico. In recent decades large parts of forest
have disappeared because of forest fires and land use
change to make it suitable for agricultural practices.
The project focuses on afforestation and reforestation
as well as implementing sustainable land management
at existing farms to stop land degradation. With the
proceeds from the CO2 credits, local farmers are
trained in sustainable land management and are
involved in planting new climate-proof forest plots. For
instance, by planting native tree species throughout
coffee plantations, they are providing shade and
increasing soil fertility and biodiversity.
2.4.7 Compliance with laws and
regulations
 MT7
We strictly adhere to laws and regulations. These
days, especially in the financial services sector, social
standards are an important part of the interpretation
of laws and regulations and unwritten rules.
OUTSIDE-IN IMPACT
The risk type associated with this material topic
is compliance risk. Non-compliance with laws and
regulations may have a negative impact, both
financially and non-financially. Besides these negative
effects, we are required to comply with certain laws
and regulations to operate our business. Based on an
internal strategic risk analysis, we determined that this
material topic has a high material risk.
INSIDE-OUT IMPACT
Complying with laws and regulations is a prerequisite
for our ‘license to operate’. We create shared
value and a positive impact for our stakeholders
by complying with said laws and regulations, for
example laws that aim at preventing money laundering
(Wwft), and guidelines that live up to our duty of
care for our customer (Know Your Customer), see
Section Customer interests for more information
on preventing money laundering and Section 2.5.1
Other material topics for information on Know Your
Customer.
Potential negative impacts due to non-compliance with
laws and regulations are, for example, scams, money
laundering, financing of terrorism, data breaches and
hacking. By complying with the relevant laws and
regulations we avoid these negative impacts. We are
also exposed to potential negative impacts through
our business relationships, for example if our suppliers
or counterparties do not comply with national and
international laws and regulations.
MANAGEMENT OF THE IMPACT
De Volksbank’s Compliance Function continuously
monitors compliance levels with regulatory internal
policies. With the help of tools, such as regulatory
technology and new privacy tooling, we aim to manage
our potential negative impact by ensuring improved
identification and management of compliance risks.
We take all reasonable measures to prevent the bank
and/or the financial system in general from being

misused for money laundering and the financing of
terrorism.
In addition, we developed a Risk Management Policy
Compliance Risk which describes the risk management
framework for compliance risks. Compliance risk can
be divided into three sub integrity risks, i.e. business
integrity risk, conduct integrity risk and client integrity
risk. To minimise compliance risks, these sub risk types
each have their own risk policies. There are internal
key risk indicators - also for each sub integrity risk - to
track our effectiveness and monitor compliance risks.
De Volksbank strives to achieve the desired corporate
culture, attitude and conduct. By disclosing how we
comply with laws and regulations, we make sure that
both our customers and society are up to date on
this topic. We also organise awareness sessions about
new laws and regulations and our compliance and risk
culture for our employees. At our General Meeting
of Shareholders there is continuous attention for
compliance. On certain anti-money laundering-related
topics, we continue to collaborate with major banks
and public parties, the Financial Intelligence Unit and
the national police. We also continue to participate
in Transaction Monitoring Netherlands (TMNL). Read
more on compliance with laws and regulations in
Sections 4.5 Operational (non-financial) risks and 1.1.2
Regulatory environment.
2.4.8 Social engagement, cooperation
and entrepreneurship
 MT8
We strive for close social cooperation with a broad
group of stakeholders and include their input where
possible. We do this by being involved at a regional,
national and international level. For example, we
support entrepreneurship, accessibility of the housing
market and quality of life in communities.
OUTSIDE-IN IMPACT
The risk type associated with this material topic
is business risk. Failure to satisfactorily meet the
expectations of our stakeholders with regard to social
engagement, cooperation and entrepreneurship may
negatively affect our customer relationships, which
may in turn negatively affect our business. Based on
an internal strategic risk analysis we determined this
material topic does not have a high material risk.
INSIDE-OUT IMPACT
De Volksbank is committed to achieving a substantial
and measurable positive impact on society. For
example, by improving quality of life in communities,
making the housing market more accessible and giving
attention to equal growth opportunities for everyone.
We do this by means of branch offices and shops in
regional areas and by promoting entrepreneurship in
small communities.
We have not identified any material negative impacts
on the environment, economy or people specifically
through our own activities or business relations.
This excludes the impacts (positive and negative)
human activities in general have on the environment,
economy or people, as growth and human activities
are intertwined with having impact. As mentioned
above, we have not identified any material impacts on
this topic in that respect.
MANAGEMENT OF THE IMPACT
There are several KPIs in place to manage our positive
impacts. To monitor the accessibility of the housing
market in the Netherlands, we launched the Housing
Accessibility Monitor. KPIs are also being developed
for quality of life in the region and attention to equal
growth opportunities for everyone. Read more about
the progress on these themes in Section 1.3 Our
strategic progress and in our Annual Review Section
3.2.2 Inclusive Society.
De Volksbank has strict sustainability criteria for
investments to make a positive contribution to society
and to minimise our negative impact. We continuously
assess if investments still meet our sustainability
criteria. As we update these criteria on a regular basis,
this may lead to the termination of specific loans or
investments in our investment universe or portfolio.
Read more about our policies and commitments in
Section 2.2.4 Strategy, policy and practices.
In addition, we engage with different stakeholders.
These stakeholders consist of customers, advisers,
collaborative partners, businesses, networks and
society as a whole. Read more about how we engage
with stakeholders and examples of topics, stakeholder
expectations and activities in Section 2.2.5 Stakeholder
engagement.

COUNTERING CYBER AND FINANCIAL CRIME
 MT9
With the rapid digitalisation, cyber and financial
crime unfortunately remains a fact of life. Criminals
are increasingly sophisticated in their operations.
We see cybercrime moving more from the banking
environment to the customer environment. In doing
so, criminals are increasingly persuading customers to
enter into a transaction and approve it themselves.
The fight against financial crime also continues. We
ourselves monitor payment transactions that may
indicate money laundering and terrorist financing. Our
role as gatekeeper of the financial system remains as
important as ever. We also continuously improve our
fraud detection systems. At the same time, we are
seeing more and more reports of bank helpdesk fraud,
boiler room fraud, phishing and help request scam
via WhatsApp. We note an increase in identity fraud
and a doubling in the number of dating fraud cases
compared to 2021. In 2022, we saw an average of 155
reported fraud cases involving payment transactions
per week, a decrease in comparison with the previous
year.
Resilient customers
To make our customers digitally resilient, we raise
awareness of cybercrime and teach them to recognise
fraud and scams. In 2021, for instance, we launched
the online training course 'Safe Banking - Do You
Recognise the Scammer?' In this film-based training
course, customers experience the ways in which
scammers can approach them. In 2022, we took the
next step by making the training available not only
to our customers, but to everyone who banks online.
Furthermore, every newsletter of SNS and RegioBank
features a blog with tips against fraud.
Our employees are our human firewall
Employees and customers alike contribute to safe
banking; they form the first line of defence. We
do not consider people to be the weakest link, we
regard them as an essential part of our security.
For that reason we developed the training entitled
Human Firewall, in which more and more employees
participate actively. Realistic and tailor-made situations
teach us how to recognise cybercrime and scams, and
more importantly, how to act quickly and effectively.
We thus create a strong security chain together.
Appropriate measures against fraud and scams
If customers - despite all efforts - fall victim to
cybercrime, we take measures to mitigate the damage
and provide aftercare to restore trust in digital
banking. As far as phishing is concerned, we have
optimised our monitoring and detection in 2022,
significantly reducing this form of fraud. De Volksbank
has joined forces with other (financial) institutions and
public partners to ensure that scamming does not pay.
For instance, we have made the case to politicians
for necessary legislation on information exchange.
Furthermore, together with the Ministry of Justice and
Security and other parties in the market, we investigate
how we can further reduce online crime together. We
also contributed to the new 'Safe Banking' campaign of
the Dutch Banking Association, which was launched in
October 2022.
Know your customer
As one of the gatekeepers of the financial system,
de Volksbank helps detect and prevent financial crime
by taking a holistic approach to customer integrity
in relation to anti-money laundering, countering
the financing of terrorism and compliance through
sanctions and tax regulations.
As a financial institution, we are required to have a
clear picture of our customers, for instance under the
Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Prevention)
Act (Wwft). As part of the Know Your Customer
principle, we check customer data and establish
the identity of our customers. In addition, we are
required to conduct ongoing monitoring of customers
and transactions carried out during the term of
the relationship. This legal obligation to prevent
involvement in financial-economic crime, such as
money laundering and terrorist financing, also extends
to the identification of tax integrity risks among
customers.
INTEGRITY AND ETHICS
 MT10
Ethics Office
De Volksbank's mission 'Banking with a human touch'
also includes the ethical consideration of various
forms of decision making. To this end, we have set
up an Ethics Office to properly weigh up conflicting
ethical values. We base our considerations on a vision
document that contains our standards and values
for the use of data and Artificial Intelligence (AI). In
2022, we further explored the topic of 'Explainability'
with the help of external expertise. For some time
now, we have been paying more attention to the use
of AI models. Therefore, ethical assessment of these
models has become a regular part of de Volksbank's
development cycle.
The Ethics Office plays an important role not only
in raising awareness of ethical risks, but also as a
facilitator for our Ethics Sounding Board Group. The
sounding board group consists of a diverse group of
colleagues who can shed light on ethical dilemmas
we are facing, and can suggest possible mitigating
measures. Ethics Office experts examine if it is possible
to use the tools and techniques developed for AI
on a wider scale. Apart from AI-related issues, the
Ethics Office is therefore also involved in other ethical
issues, for instance when launching a new product.
In 2022, the Ethics Office was formally placed under
the Compliance Centre of Expertise. From this new
position, the Ethics Office is also involved in tightening
various policies on ethical behaviour, in other words,
integrity.

Ethical leadership
There is a demonstrable positive correlation between
an ethical 'tone at the top' and the ethical actions
of employees within an organisation. Therefore, the
Ethics Office, together with HR, is also developing a
programme on 'Ethical Leadership'. As part of this, the
Ethics Office started setting up an Ethics Committee in
2022.
Anti-corruption and bribery
An important condition for de Volksbank to properly
implement its strategy and its shared value ambition
is that de Volksbank, its employees, collaboration
partners and customers are not involved in corruption
and bribery. Corruption creates unfair competition
in the economy, distorts public trust and damages
de Volksbank's integrity. To prevent us and our
customers from becoming involved in corruption, we
take measures that apply to various policies, such as
our customer acceptance policy, procurement policy,
outsourcing policy and pre-employment screening
policy. All listed companies we invest in or have
a business relationship with as well as government
bonds are screened for anti-corruption. We have
drawn up a code of conduct, entitled ‘Common Sense,
Clear Conscience’, which is signed by all employees.
Furthermore, all employees have taken an oath
or made a solemn affirmation, promising they will
comply with laws and regulations and codes and
rules of conduct related to their profession, and
how to behave ethically. This is one of the ways
in which we aim to minimise the risk of physical,
financial or reputational damage to de Volksbank,
its customers and/or other business relations. We
adequately deal with every sign of corruption with
and follow this up with an appropriate response.
Our anti-corruption policy describes the management
measures taken by de Volksbank to prevent the bank
and/or its employees and customers from engaging
in corruption. Our compliance-related policies are
available on our website. For more details on the risks
associated with the aforementioned topics and the
way we conduct our risk management, see Section 4.
Risk management of this report.
We currently have no specific KPIs on corruption.
We do, however, monitor two elements related to
behaviour, namely the bankers' oath and the code
of conduct. The bankers' oath has been signed
by 99.925% of our employees within 3 months of
commencing employment. Every year, the code of
conduct is brought to the attention of our employees,
at which time they have to re-sign it. In 2022, 97.8%
of our employees did so. Although we normally also
conduct an annual training on the code of conduct,
this year we did not because it was rewritten and
a new training had to be developed. We also offer
internal e-learnings on ethical dilemmas and regularly
address ethical issues and how to deal with them. All
Employee Integrity (Compliance) staff has been trained
to facilitate sessions on ethical dilemmas.
To better understand our organisational culture,
we conducted a survey on the culture of integrity
within the organisation in 2022. The objective of this
measurement is to give depth to our understanding
of the day-to-day work environment and how our
organisational culture is supporting employees to act
with integrity. These insights give us guidance as
to how to prevent potentially undesired behaviour
and manage behavioural risks. This year’s baseline
measurement consisted of a questionnaire, followed
by discussions with the teams to enhance the results,
resulting in a first impression of the organisational
culture in relation to ethical behaviour. The first
follow-up measurement is planned for 2023. This
is how de Volksbank manages its behavioural risks,
i.e. this is how the bank identifies and analyses
behavioural risks. This survey revealed that employees
were particularly positive about the motivation to
achieve team objectives with integrity, about the
intrinsic motivation to comply with the rules of conduct
and about treating each other respectfully within the
teams. Employees were least positive on the topics
of enforcement and transparency. For example, they
felt that the measure taken in cases of non-ethical
behaviour were not always consistent, and that it is not
always clear what others are doing.
The material topics of corporate governance and
compliance with laws and regulations are inextricably
linked to this topic. These material topics and the
related indicators are listed in the table in Section
2.3.3 Management of material topics. Responsible tax
policies and remuneration are an important part of
integrity and ethics. Read more on these topics in
Sections 3.4 Remuneration Report and Responsible tax
policy.
GENUINE ATTENTION FOR OUR EMPLOYEES
 MT11
Every six months, we monitor the shared-value related
key performance indicators (KPIs) for employees:
genuine attention and commitment and engagement.

see Section 1.3.5 Our strategic objectives.
Employee vitality and safety
At de Volksbank, every employee should have a
safe and healthy work environment. That is why
we organise the working conditions as best as we
can, with the help of our employees. They were,
for example, asked to contribute ideas on how to
improve working conditions at the bank in round-table
discussions with the occupational health and safety
service.
In 2022, nearly a third of our employees took the
health test offered by de Volksbank every three years.
This preventive medical examination consists of a
questionnaire, a physical examination and a discussion
of the results with a vitality adviser, giving them
guidance as to what steps they can take to be as fit
as possible.
In the past year, the absenteeism rate was 5.1% (2021:
4.2%). The causes of this increase were mainly related
to Covid-19.
We are aware that there are certain employee-related
risks, such as not being able to fill vacancies. For

more information on People risk, see Section 4.5
Operational (non-financial) risks. The current collective
labour agreement (CLA) for 2022-2023 contains
new arrangements to improve work-life balance. In
addition, we have developed a vision on a 'New Way
of Working 2.0', allowing employees to organise their
work in such a way that works best for them and their
team.
After almost two years of largely working from home,
more space for employees to meet and work together
in the office came again from March 2022. Activity-
based and place and time-independent working is
the norm. We started working according to these
principles:
• Teamwork: the purpose of a team is result-
oriented collaboration. Team members jointly
decide together where they work and when they
meet.
• Autonomy: as regards the number of days worked
in the office or at home, de Volksbank imposes no
restrictions and gives employees no guidance, so
there are no more fixed office or work from home
days.
• Vitality: employees pay attention to their mental and
physical well-being - and that of their colleagues,
tailoring their workday schedule to their vitality and
discussing this with colleagues if necessary. This
movement coincides with our (agile) way of working.
To provide a safe place to work, we have a
code of conduct entitled 'Common Sense, Clear
Conscience', which sets out how we treat each other
and customers. In 2021 employees were required
to follow an e-learning on this code of conduct.
Moreover, de Volksbank has appointed an Confidential
Adviser at various locations throughout the country.
Furthermore, complaints in relation to bullying, sexual
harassment, discrimination, aggression or violence
at work are dealt with by the Committee for
Unacceptable Behaviour. In this regard, employees
may also engage in mediation through a counsellor.
Learning and personal development
De Volksbank values employee development. We
therefore reimburse necessary training courses and
team development activities, which may also be taken
and carried out during working hours. In addition,
every employee (including part-timers) receives an
annual personal development budget in the amount
of € 750 (accrued up to a maximum of € 2,250), which
may be used for their sustainable employability.
Investments in employee training and development
amounted to € 6.1 million in 2022 (2021: € 7.1 million),
or € 1,943 per employee (2021: € 2,246). We do not
record the number of hours employees spend on
training and development. We encourage employees
by making the learning and development platform to
book training courses and to acquire new knowledge
and skills readily available (usually free of charge).
For example, through the summer and winter schools
of de Volksbank Academy, employees were given
weekly learning tips on topics as diverse as customer
orientation and personal effectiveness. Over 2,500
employees made use of this opportunity.
As de Volksbank, we are in the middle of the
movement towards a learning organisation in which
developing skills is key. Not just alongside work,
but especially during work. Teams map out their
development needs and work on them in a targeted
way. In addition, employee development is part of
the team dialogues. This enables us to respond more
quickly to changes in our environment and to the
changing needs of our customers.
New agile organisation
On 1 March 2022, de Volksbank launched a new way
of working according to the Agile principles, through
which we aim to become more agile and customer-
oriented. The entire agile transition process will take
two to three years. One uniform way of working,
entitled 'de Volksbank's collaboration model', applies
to everyone. In this collaboration model employees
work according to both the Scrum and Lean approach.
Independent teams form the core of the organisation,
which is set up in Hubs and Centres of Expertise. The
latter are responsible for policy making, frameworks
and standards: the 'how'. They ensure that employees
with the right knowledge and skills are available for the
Hubs. Hubs realise the strategic objectives: the 'what'.
With the transformation and the new way of working,
we call on different behaviour from employees. Part of
our staff started in new teams on 1 March. Employees
who were made redundant were assisted in finding
other work, within or outside the bank.
Unacceptable behaviour
We treat each other and others with respect, i.e.
open and equal, with a human touch and with
an eye and appreciation for others. Regardless of
nationality, culture, religion, gender, age and health.
So without discrimination, bullying or any form of
prejudice. At de Volksbank, we do everything we can
to prevent boundary violations. With support tools
for employees and managers, such as the Code
of Conduct, workshops and dilemma sessions, we
encourage a culture in which it is normal to call
each other to account for behaviour. Unfortunately,
unacceptable behaviour does occur. In 2022, we
therefore gave employees extra information about
where to go if they do not feel safe. Besides going to
their manager or a colleague, employees can go to an
external confidential counsellor. Should the boundary
violation lead to a complaint, an employee can turn to
the Committee for Unacceptable Behaviour.
RESPONSIBLE RISK MANAGEMENT
 MT12
We opt for low-risk business activities and avoid
aggressive risk-return strategies. See Section 4. Risk
management for more information on this material
topic, including information on our risk management
structure and sustainability risk.

FINANCIAL HEALTH AND INCLUSION
 MT13
We aim for all Dutch citizens to enjoy financial
wellbeing so they can live comfortably and pleasantly.
As a bank, we can make direct social impact by
helping customers and non-customers alike with their
financial health and by standing up for financial
inclusion. To match words with deeds, we signed the
Commitment to Financial Health and Inclusion at the
end of 2021. This initiative is part of the Principles for
Responsible Banking and by signing, we pledge to use
our employees, products, services and relationships to
promote universal, financial inclusion.
Financial education
It is important to teach children at an early age
to handle money well. Sufficient financial knowledge
gives them a solid basis to make the right choices
thus preventing money problems later in life. Financial
education is not a standard part of schools' curriculum.
That is why, in 2013, de Volksbank started providing
free Eurowijs (Euro wise) teaching materials. And ever
since the start, our employees have been giving guest
lectures in schools. In addition, our brands provide
financial education about safe banking, both in person
and in (online) workshops. We do this for people of
all ages. By 2022, we will have reached 250,500 pupils
with Eurowijs teaching materials, compared to 213,449
pupils in 2021.
Financial care
Our 'Financial peace of mind' team helps customers
who are experiencing financial worries. This is how
we live up to our ambition to help customers make
decisions about their sustainable financial future in a
personal way. In 2022, we were thus able to help 70
people who experienced financial stress.
Accessible services
We strive for open and sincere contact with our
customers, regardless of time or channel. Our four
brands each interact with their customers in their
own way, thus complementing each other perfectly.
ASN Bank operates an Internet-only model and
communicates intensively and mainly online. In
addition, the ASN Mortgage is offered via SNS Shops.
BLG Wonen works together with independent advisers
across the country and also offers the SNS Business
mortgage through them. In turn, SNS and RegioBank
have a strong local presence through independent
advisers, with RegioBank specifically focussing on
small towns and villages up to 20,000 inhabitants.
While SNS works partly with franchisees and partly
with its own shops, RegioBank operates exclusively
with a franchise formula. Together, our brands thus
have national coverage and there is always a branch
nearby where customers can walk in for help or advice,
thus making a strong case for financial health and
inclusion, for young and old, for now and later. And
this is appreciated by our customers: in a survey by the
Consumers' Association, RegioBank emerged as the
best bank in the Netherlands in 2022 for the sixth year
in a row. SNS and ASN Bank too, finished in the top 3.
We set high standards for the availability of services
such as debit card payments, iDeal and online and
mobile banking. In 2022, the online payment services
of SNS, ASN Bank and RegioBank were available more
than 99.77% of the time.
DIGITALISATION AND INNOVATION
 MT14
The acceleration of digitalisation, which was given a
strong boost by the Covid-19 pandemic, has resulted
in a wide range of digital products and services
for retail and SME customers, of which customers
have increasingly higher expectations. Especially
for the younger generations, a good, personalised
digital banking environment is essential. Naturally,
de Volksbank is committed to a simple and reliable
online environment. We invest in digitalisation, in
line with our chosen strategy for the coming years.
This allows us to strengthen our relationship with
customers in a growing online world. A large part
of customer contact is digital and we want to keep
that contact accessible, personal, preserving a human
touch. That is why we like to offer a good mix of
digital convenience and personal contact. At times that
are relevant to customers. This year, we have taken
some good steps in that direction. For instance, the
process of becoming a customer of our brands, or
applying for a combination of new products, is now
a lot easier and faster thanks to improvements in
our digital application processes. We have also made
service processes that were previously only available
online to our advisers. This allows them to serve
customers faster and easier. After all, this reduces
paperwork and administrative work.
HUMAN RIGHTS
 MT15
Human rights are an important part of our
sustainability policy. So we look where our investments
pose human rights risks and take action to mitigate
them.
European Citizens' Initiative
The campaign entitled Good Clothes, Fair Pay was
launched in July 2022. This campaign is part of a
European Citizens' Initiative launched by ASN Bank in
2021 in cooperation with the Fair Wear Foundation
and Fashion Revolution. The goal: collect 1 million
signatures in one year to enforce legislation around
living wages in the global garment, textile and
footwear industry. The legislative proposal advocated
by this initiative contains concrete measures for all
garment, footwear and textile companies looking
to sell their products in the European Union.
The proposal was registered with the European
Commission in the second quarter of 2022.
Uyghur forced labour in solar panels
In 2021, alarming reports appeared of serious human
rights violations China's region of Xinjiang. Almost all
major solar panel manufacturers who also sell their
products in the Netherlands, work with suppliers from
that region. This makes the solar energy industry
vulnerable to forced labour. Needless to say that de
Volksbank wants to avoid (co) financing solar panels

and other components and raw materials required for
production in any way. As ASN Bank and ASN Impact
Investors finance renewable energy projects and
companies, and we also offer solar panels through the
online Home Improvement platform, we investigated
possible abuses. This investigation resulted in a list
of approved suppliers where our customers purchase
solar panels that we finance. The same applies for the
Home Improvement platform; its installation partners
exclusively work with solar panels approved by us. We
continued this investigation in 2022.
Salient human rights risk analysis
In order to keep up to date with developments in the world as well as within our own organisation we started with a new salient human
rights risk analysis in the last quarter of 2022. The goal of this analysis was to find out how our activities could be linked to human rights
risks in international value chains to which we are connected. In conducting this analysis, we follow the United Nations Guiding Principles
for Business and Human Rights. At the moment of publication of this report, the results of the analysis are not yet known. Based on the
outcomes we will define our human rights priorities for 2023 and beyond.
Our previous salient human rights risk analysis of 2018 identified the following five most salient issues:
1. a living wage in the garment industry
2. a living wage in the agri-food industry
3. workplace health and safety in the garment industry
4. consumer protection in the pharmaceutical industry
5. clinical trials in the pharmaceutical industry
1 & 2. A living wage is a human right that enables workers to afford basic needs such as food. Our exposure to companies in the
agri-food market is smaller than to garment companies. In order to maximise the effectiveness of our engagement, we decided to focus
on living wage in the garment industry. We have developed a KPI for the human rights pillar of our sustainability policy, the KPI Living
wage: all the 15 listed brands we invest in will need to have processes in place by 2030 to enable the payment of a living wage to
the workers that make the clothes. That is why we founded the Platform Living Wage Financials (PLWF) in 2018, together with MN and
Triodos Investment Management. As in previous years, we assessed the garment companies in our investment portfolio. This annual
assessments of investee companies on living wage and living income shows that even though some companies made progress, the
overall progress on the topic of living wage and living income remains slow. In 2030 we want all 15 brands in our universe to score in the
category Leaders. In October 2022 the latest results were published in the Platform Living Wage Financials Annual Report.
3. Workplace health and safety is a critical issue in the garment industry, and is part of our companies' analyses and the investment
portfolio decision-making process. Together with our PLWF partners, we engage with garment companies to express our concerns and
push for measures that would not only protect workers on the work floor, but that would also support workers financially if necessary.
4 & 5. Even though the pharmaceutical companies we invest in have sound policies in place, we have engaged with them since 2015
as they were frequently involved in controversies on customer safety-related issues. The Covid-19 pandemic continued to influence our
engagement with pharmaceutical companies in 2022. Through a joint initiative of 65 institutional investors we are calling on Covid-19
vaccine manufacturers to quickly increase the availability and deployment of vaccinations around the world.

commitments regarding human rights, see Section
2.2.4 Strategy, policies and practices
CORPORATE GOVERANCE
 MT16
We want to organise the bank in a structured
and ethical way that fits our vision. See Section
3. Governance for more on this material topic, for
example for information on our remuneration or legal
structure.
DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
 MT17
Feeling at home at de Volksbank
Our goal is for everyone to feel at home at
de Volksbank. It is therefore imperative that we
offer employees a diverse and inclusive working
environment. Besides, more diversity brings different
insights, qualities and backgrounds. To increase
diversity and inclusion, we have taken several
steps. For instance, we now have a more objective
recruitment and selection process, a people-oriented
leadership style and an ever-improving gender
balance. Our employee survey on inclusion shows that
82% of employees feel at home at de Volksbank (2021:
85%), slightly higher than our goal of more than 80%.
Throughout the year, we regularly draw attention to
diversity and inclusion (D&I). We share stories, offer
e-learnings, organise dialogue sessions on dilemmas
and facilitate teams to engage in conversations about
diversity and how colleagues interact. We also set
up the D&I Community to share knowledge and
experiences with each other within de Volksbank. By
the end of 2022, employees were able to have their say
on a more progressive D&I policy during roundtable
discussions.
Diversity in gender
In the Fair Bank Guide's Gender practice survey, de
Volksbank scored best of all banks on gender equality.

70 de Volksbank N.V. Integrated Annual Report 2022
A focus in 2022 was more balanced representation
in senior management. In the course of 2022, we
made up a significant amount of ground. In the
Supervisory Board, 40% are women and in the
Executive Committee (ExCo) 43%. The challenge now
is to ensure that of all leadership positions at least 40%
are women. We are well on the way with this too; by
the end of 2022, this was 39% (2021: 36%), our goal for
2022 was 37%. To achieve this, we make arrangements
for this when vacancies arise and appointments are
made. De Volksbank employs 54% men and 46%
women.
De Volksbank pays men and women the same in
equal situations; we aim for the pay gap, adjusted for
pay scale and age, to be between -0.5 and 0.5%. In
2021, this pay gap (the gender pay gap) was minimal:
0.04% in favour of men. The gender pay gap was not
examined in 2022; it will be examined again in 2023.
A table containing numbers on gender balance can be
found in Section 2.2.2 Our activities and employees.
Diversity and cultural background
Cultural diversity is but one of the facets of the
broad diversity that we consider important as a bank.
De Volksbank, therefore, participated in the Statistics
Netherlands (CBS) Cultural Barometer for the first time
in 2022. By doing so, we aim to gain more insight
into the cultural diversity of our organisation. This
stimulates conversation, creates more awareness and
provides direction for follow-up actions. The results of
the Cultural Barometer showed that de Volksbank's
workforce is a good reflection of the Dutch labour
market and the financial services sector. Our customer
contact employees are a good reflection of the group
of (potential) customers. Several of de Volksbank's
colleagues are part of the Agora Network's cross-
mentoring programme as a mentor or mentee. Within
this network, various organisations work together
to create a more diverse and inclusive culture and
promote the inflow, advancement and retention of
multicultural talent.
Work ability diversity
In 2022, we launched the Work Ability Desk to enhance
the work ability of people who are struggling in
the labour market. Initially, we focus on providing
people with a disability with sustainable employment.
Through the Work Ability Desk, we aim to offer equal
opportunities to people with workplace disabilities at
de Volksbank. The desk facilitates, coordinates and
supports everyone at de Volksbank who wants to work
on this theme. For instance, inspiration sessions are
organised in which employees with a disability share
their stories with the aim of combating prejudices
and assumptions, thinking in terms of possibilities
and looking precisely at the talent of people with
a disability. In 2022, this resulted in seven new
colleagues with a distance to the labour market being
hired by de Volksbank.
Skill diversity
Each employee has a unique set of skills, knowledge
and experience. In every team, this diversity comes
together. In 2022, several teams set to work to identify
what skills their particular team needs to achieve their
goals. By then determining per team member to what
extent these skills are already present, the teams
gained insight into the team's diversity. This knowledge
is used to develop individual and team skills.
BIODIVERSITY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
 MT18
Besides land-use change, overexploitation and
pollution, climate change is one of the main threats
to nature and biodiversity. While we need that very
same biodiversity to combat climate change. Forests,
peatlands, soils and oceans play an important role
in carbon absorption. In addition, biodiversity is
indispensable for humans; for instance, it provides
us with food, clean water, clean air and natural
substances for the development of many medicines.
Our offices have a relatively small impact on
biodiversity compared to the impact of our
investments and loans to projects, countries and
corporates. We want to prevent further biodiversity
loss as much as possible and contribute to biodiversity
restoration. Therefore, we want our investments and
loans to have more positive than negative impact on
biodiversity by 2030, in other words: a net positive
impact. We want to achieve this by reducing our
negative impact on biodiversity and increasing our
positive impact by investing in nature development
and restoration, renewable energy and the circular
economy. Although we are currently still working on
the further development of de Volksbank's net positive
goal, we have already included an initial result in the
Social Impact Framework in our Annual Review 2022.
ASN Biodiversity Fund for investing in nature
protection and restoration
ASN Bank launched the ASN Biodiversity Fund in
November 2021. It is the first fund in Europe
that invests in projects contributing to biodiversity
protection and restoration and is accessible to retail
customers. The fund focusses on four sectors, i.e.
sustainable forestry, (forest) agriculture, sustainable
seas and fisheries and ecotourism. For example,
the fund invests in a company that uses innovative
technologies to make fish farming sustainable. We
will measure the impact on biodiversity protection
and restoration in hectares of protected and restored
areas on land and in the sea. In 2022, ASN Bank
further intensified its efforts in the field of biodiversity,
being the first financial institution to sign the
Biodiversity Covenant of the North Sea Foundation
and the Nature & Environment organisation. By doing
so, ASN Bank shows that investors in wind farm
can impose more stringent requirements for nature-
inclusive construction. The bank actively advocates
a sustainable North Sea in which the generation of
wind energy goes hand in hand with the protection
and enhancement of nature as much as possible.
The Partnership for Biodiversity Accounting Financials
(PBAF), initiated by ASN Bank, welcomed its 40th
participant and presented a standard for financial
institutions to measure the impact of loans and
investments on nature. In November 2022, ASN Bank
published the report 'Make Nature Count'. This report
is about the monetary value of nature and how

This is the second year that de Volksbank reports
on the EU Taxonomy Regulation under the NFRD
disclosure obligation. The regulation helps us identify
whether economic activities that we finance or invest
in may be considered environmentally sustainable and
helps us prepare transparent and comparable reports.
The regulation comprises six sustainability objectives:
1. Climate change mitigation;
2. Climate change adaptation;
3. Sustainable use and protection of water and
marine resources;
4. Transition to a circular economy;
5. Pollution prevention and control;
6. Protection and restoration of biodiversity and
healthy ecosystems.
To date, the EU Taxonomy Regulation has established
criteria for the first two objectives; criteria for the other
objectives will be published in the near future. This
being the case, we could only assess our assets on the
basis of climate change mitigation and climate change
adaptation.

74 de Volksbank N.V. Integrated Annual Report 2022
QUALITATIVE INFORMATION
Contextual information
The table above is based on the exposures
of de Volksbank within the prudential scope of
consolidation, which is the same scope that we use
for this Integrated Annual Report. The total covered
assets in the denominator of the Green Asset Ratio
(GAR) covers all financial assets with the exception
of exposures to central governments, central banks,
supranational issuers and the trading book. The table
above is based on the same gross carrying amount
exposures used by us in the rest of this Integrated
Annual Report.
We assess whether our counterparties are required to
publish non-financial information pursuant to Article
19a or 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU (NFRD) based on
internal or publicly available information.
We determined the Taxonomy eligibility of our financial
and non-financial counterparties using their published
eligibility percentages in their 2021 annual reports or
2021 sustainability reports. In a very limited number
of cases, we were unable to obtain information, as a
result of which we assessed them as non-eligible.
Environmentally sustainable bonds are included up
to the value of Taxonomy eligible economic activities
that the proceeds of those bonds finance, based on
information provided by the counterparty. Non-EU
counterparties are included in this assessment.
To assess special purpose vehicles (SPVs), we use a
look-through approach on a best effort basis. This
implies that if a NFRD counterparty is a majority
shareholder of the SPV, we used the eligibility of the
majority shareholder.
All our retail mortgages collateralised by residential
immovable property are eligible and form the largest
part of the eligibility percentage. EU Taxonomy eligible
exposure to non-financial corporations only relate to
debt securities.
Description of our compliance
De Volksbank aims to designate as many exposures as
possible to be in line with the EU Taxonomy in order
to distinguish ourselves even more as a frontrunner
in sustainability. It should be noted, however, that we
consider our goal to be climate-neutral by 2030 and
our own sustainability policies, with the exception of
some policies such as nuclear and fossil fuel activities,
to be leading. We expect the EU Taxonomy Regulation
KPI scores will improve on the back of achieving
our climate-neutrality goal, our Science Based Targets,
Climate Action Plan goals and by pursuing our
sustainability policies. For example, our taxonomy-
aligned assets could increase by expanding our green
bonds portfolio by pursuing our sustainability policies
to meet our climate-neutrality goal. We will assess
target setting on taxonomy alignment after our first
taxonomy-aligned reporting period in 2023, which may
serve as a baseline to set targets for the future and to
track performance over time.
Furthermore, we will continue to engage with
retail mortgage customers and project financing
counterparties to encourage them to make their
homes and projects more sustainable. Hence, it is our
ambition to include EU Taxonomy considerations in the
engagement with all our customers and counterparties
where feasible and appropriate. In this light we
are investigating how to integrate EU Taxonomy
considerations in our Product Design Process.
Additional information on the financing of
taxonomy-aligned economic activities
In 2017, de Volksbank adopted ASN Bank's
sustainability policy. More information on this policy
can be found in Section 2.2.4 Strategy, policies and
practices. De Volksbank subsequently implemented
this policy in the operations and processes of all its
brands and aims to be a frontrunner in sustainability
policies. These policies can be considered our own
Taxonomy as they describe our Do No Significant Harm
(DNSH) criteria and Minimum Social Safeguards (MSS)
in detail. They also provide guidance on the type of
activities that could have a positive impact on climate,
biodiversity or human rights.
De Volksbank welcomes the EU Taxonomy and will
embed it into its sustainability policy and strategy.
It should be noted that our own sustainability
policies are often more stringent and ambitious.
As an example, de Volksbank categorically excludes
investments in fossil fuel-related activities and
nuclear activities. As such, our position may
deviate from the EU Taxonomy as natural gas and
nuclear exposures for instance may be considered
‘green’ (albeit transitionally) based on the latest
taxonomy developments. De Volksbank actively
opposed to this development through its lobbying
activities. Furthermore, de Volksbank advocates more
transparency on ‘brown’ activities that would force
companies and financial institutions to disclose
information on their fossil fuel-related or other
carbon-intensive activities, for example through a
‘brown’ taxonomy.
VOLUNTARY TAXONOMY-ELIGIBILITY ASSESSMENT
Below we present a table showing our mandatory
eligibility disclosures based on our IFRS consolidated
balance sheet. As expected, most eligible exposure is
related to the balance sheet items investments, loans
and advances to banks and loans and advances to
customers.

1 Some counterparties did not specify whether its activities are CCM or CCA Taxonomy eligible, therefore we included this extra column.
The EU Taxonomy is primarily based on exposures
to retail customers and large NFRD counterparties.
However, the business model of de Volksbank focusses
on retail customers and SME customers. The latter
may be active in economic activities mentioned in
Annex I and/or Annex II of the EU Taxonomy, and
therefore could be considered eligible. For example,
the project financing portfolio in renewable energy
is eligible, but because our counterparties in that
portfolio are non-NFRD parties, we cannot include
these in our mandatory disclosures. In addition,
green or sustainable bonds that do not meet the
EU Taxonomy criteria but are considered sustainable
are also included. Supranationals with green or
sustainable bonds are also included.

Changes to the Governance Structure
As part of the Strategic Plan for 2021-2025, an
Executive Board (ExBo) and an Executive Committee
(ExCo) took office to add focus and balance to the
management of the changing organisation. Hence,
the ExBo replaced the former Board of Directors on
16 May 2022. Installation of the new ExCo is key
to a successful implementation of the strategy. The
ExCo consists of four statutory Executive Board (ExBo)
members and three non-statutory Senior Executives.
The following new positions were added to the ExCo:
• Chief Transformation Officer (CTO)
• Chief Information Officer (CIO)
• Chief People and Organisation Officer (CPOO)
As a result of the introduction of the ExCo, the position
of Chief Operations Officer (COO) has lapsed.
Role and responsibilities
The ExBo is de Volksbank’s statutory managing board
within the meaning of section 2:129 Dutch Civil
Code and is entrusted with the management of
de Volksbank. The ExCo is part of de Volksbank’s
management body in its executive function (together
with the ExBo) as defined in the Capital Requirement
Directive IV (2013/36/EU) (CRD IV) and has duties and
responsibilities that have been delegated to it by the
ExBo.
The ExBo grants a mandate to the ExCo on which
basis the ExCo is charged with and responsible
for (i) the day-to-day management of de Volksbank,
ensuring compliance with laws and regulations and the
adequate financing of its activities; (ii) the continuity
of de Volksbank and its business, aimed at long-
term value creation for de Volksbank and taking into
account the interests of all relevant stakeholders,
and (iii) implementing de Volksbanks’ mission, vision,
strategy, risk appetite, corporate standards and values,
risk framework, main policies, budgets, financial and
non-financial targets, with the aim to contribute to
long-term value creation by de Volksbank and to build
and maintain the culture required for that purpose.
In particular customer centricity, behaviour consistent
with the values, innovation and digitalisation and
sustainable growth in operating income shall be
among the main strategic objectives.
The ExCo ensures close cooperation with the
Supervisory Board in the discharge of its
responsibilities and seeks the supervision and advice
of the Supervisory Board for the bank-wide strategy
and strategy implementation. The ExCo is accountable
to the Supervisory Board and to the General Meeting
for the performance of its duties. In performing its
duties, the ExCo develops a view on long-term value
creation for de Volksbank and its business while
considering the interests of all relevant stakeholders.

Composition and diversity
As from 1 October 2022, the ExCo consists of the Chief
Executive Officer (CEO), the Chief Financial Officer
(CFO), the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), the Chief Customer
Officer (CCO), the Chief Transformation Officer (CTO),
the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the Chief
People and Organisation Officer (CPOO).
The ExCo’s composition is based on de Volksbank’s
Diversity and Inclusion Policy which focuses on
recognising and valuing both customers' and
employees' diversity. The purpose of the policy is to
optimally contribute to the execution of the bank’s
strategy. The Supervisory Board draws up a generic
profile for the ExCo in consultation with the ExCo
itself. This profile specifies the required knowledge,
suitability, expertise, integrity and availability of the
ExCo and its members. As far as education and
professional experience are concerned, the profile sets
out the relevant aspects of diversity and inclusion,
such as nationality, age, gender and background with
regard to education and professional experience.
As from 1 January 2022, the Dutch Act on Gender
Balance in Management and Supervisory Boards (Act
on Gender Balance) came into force. This Act on
Gender Balance imposes an ingrowth quota of at least
one-third male and one-third female members on the
supervisory boards of Dutch listed companies in the
Netherlands. Although de Volksbank is not a listed
company, and its shares are privately held by NLFI, the
bank voluntarily applies the Act on Gender Balance in
full. In addition, de Volksbank has to have drawn up
appropriate and ambitious targets to promote gender
diversity across the organisation and is required to
report on the above targets and plans, and the
progress made. De Volksbank’s 2025 target has been
set at a 40%/60% female/male ratio. At year-end 2022,
the percentage of women on the ExCo was 42%, which
is in line with de Volksbank’s diversity policy.
The generic profile of the ExBo was amended as from
16 May 2022. The generic profile for the ExBo was
approved by NLFI and published on our website. In
succession planning and when filling vacancies, de
Volksbank gives due consideration to any applicable
diversity requirements in its search for suitable new
members for the ExBo and ExCo's Senior Executives
who meet the fit and proper requirements stipulated
in the Act on Dutch Financial Markets Supervision and
CRD IV.
Appointment, suspension and dismissal
Members of the ExBo are appointed and reappointed
by NLFI on nomination by the Supervisory Board and
after approval by the supervisory authorities. NLFI

suspends and dismisses members of the ExBo. The
ExCo's Senior Executives are appointed, suspended
and/or dismissed by the ExBo subject to the approval
of the Supervisory Board and supervisory authorities.
When considering approval the Supervisory Board
shall take into account the advice of the People
and Organisation Committee (P&OC). Both ExBo and
ExCo members are appointed and reappointed for a
maximum term of four (4) years, in accordance with
the rotation scheme.
When preparing the appointment and reappointment
of the members of the ExCo, the P&OC and the
Supervisory Board consider the diversity objectives laid
down in de Volksbank’s internal policies such as the
(Re)Appointment Policy. To be eligible for appointment
candidates are required to meet the Fit and Proper
test under the Dutch Financial Markets Supervision
Act (Wft). The Works Council has the right to prior
consultation on the appointment of members of the
Executive Committee. The Supervisory Board notifies
the General Meeting of the intended appointment
or reappointment of an ExCo member, accompanied
by a short resume of the candidate, including the
candidate’s age, gender, educational and professional
background.
Further information on the suspension and dismissal
procedure of the ExCo is provided in de Volksbank’s
Articles of Association and the ExCo’s Rules of
Procedure as published on our website.
Functioning
The Articles of Association of de Volksbank contain a
list of the duties of the ExCo and the rules governing
its functioning. Additional practical arrangements on
how the ExCo is to exercise its duties and powers are
defined in the ExBo's and ExCo’s Rules of Procedure
and in the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)
between NLFI and de Volksbank.
The Rules of Procedure for the ExBo and ExCo are
effective from 16 May 2022 and were amended with
effect from 1 December 2022. The ExCo meets on
a weekly basis and takes decisions by a majority of
votes. In fulfilling the mission and ambition of de
Volksbank, the ExCo continuously and explicitly weighs
up the interests of all stakeholders.

Supervisory Board
Role and responsibilities
The Supervisory Board (SB) supervises, advises,
challenges and supports the ExBo and ExCo exercising
of its powers and duties. Together with the ExCo, the
SB is responsible for de Volksbank’s long-term value
creation, requiring members to execute their duties
in a sustainable manner with due observance of the
long-term viability of the strategy being pursued. The
SB is part of de Volksbank’s ‘management body in its
supervisory function’ as defined in CRD IV.
In discharging its task, the SB takes into account the
dynamics and the relationship between the ExBo, ExCo
and its members. The SB’s early and close involvement
with the ExBo and ExCo is required when formulating
the bank-wide strategy and targets in line with the
pursued culture aimed at long-term value creation.
In performing their duties, the members of the SB
are guided by the interests of de Volksbank and its
businesses, taking due consideration of the legitimate
interests of all stakeholders of de Volksbank.
Certain decisions taken by the ExBo and ExCo are
subject to the approval of the SB. Further information
on the role and responsibilities of the SB is provided
in de Volksbank’s Articles of Association and the SB’s
Rules of Procedure as published on our website.
Appointment, suspension and dismissal
Members of the SB are appointed and reappointed by
the General Meeting, upon nomination by the SB itself.
To be eligible for appointment candidates are required
to meet the Fit and Proper test under the Wft.
The General Meeting and the Works Council may
recommend candidates to the SB to be nominated
as members of the SB. The diversity objectives laid
down in de Volksbank’s internal policies are taken
into consideration when preparing the appointment
and reappointment of the members of the SB. The
SB notifies the General Meeting of the intended
appointment or reappointment of a member of the
SB, accompanied by a short resume of the candidate,
including the candidate’s age, gender, educational
and professional background and geographical
provenance.
The SB is required to nominate a candidate
recommended by the Works Council in respect of
one third of the members of the SB (the ‘enhanced
right of recommendation’). The SB is to accept
the recommendation of the Works Council unless
it believes that the candidate recommended is
unsuitable to fulfil the duties of a member of the SB
or if the SB would not be properly composed if the
appointment was made as recommended. The SB may
suspend any of its members at any time. In the event
of lack of confidence in the SB the General Meeting
may dismiss the SB in its entirety.
Further information on the appointment, suspension
and dismissal procedure of the members of the SB
is provided in de Volksbank’s Articles of Association

Functioning
In performing its duties, the SB continuously weighs
up the interests of all its stakeholders to fulfil
the mission and ambition of de Volksbank. The SB
members operate independently of each other within
the meaning of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code
and in accordance with the Dutch Central Bank's (DNB)
position on the independent functioning of the SB.
In December 2022 de Volksbank updated the Code
of Conduct Common Sense, Clear Conscience, (Code
of Conduct). The Code of Conduct contains a conflict-
of- interest procedure and a procedure for respectful
and professional conduct. In addition, the Articles
of Association contain a list of the duties and rules
governing the functioning of the SB. Both the Rules of
Procedure for the SB and the MoU agreed with NLFI
include additional agreements on the way in which the
SB should exercise its duties and powers as well as on
the appointment of the Chair of the SB and the CEO.
The Rules of Procedure for the SB were last amended
on 1 December 2022. The SB meets at least six times a
year, and takes decisions by a majority of votes.
Ancillary positions and conflicting
interests
Members of the SB may hold and are to disclose
other positions, including directorships. CRD IV and
the Dutch Corporate Governance Code (DCGC) restrict
the total number of SB positions or non-executive
directorships that may be held by a SB member, if
the SB member also has an executive board position.
It is the responsibility of the individual SB member
and the SB to ensure that the directorship duties are
performed properly and are not affected by any other
positions being held by the individual member outside
de Volksbank and its group structure.
SB members are to report any (potential) conflicts
of interests and to provide all relevant information
relating to them. The SB, excluding the member
concerned, decides whether a conflict of interest
exists. In case of any conflict of interest exists, the
relevant member of the SB abstains from discussions
and decision-making on a subject or transaction in
relation to which the relevant SB member has a
(potential) conflict of interest.
In accordance with the DCGC and the Rules of
Procedure of the SB any transaction with one or more
members of the SB that is of material significance to
de Volksbank in which there are (potential) conflicting
interests, will be disclosed in the management report
together with a statement of the conflict of interest.

Composition and diversity
The SB is composed in such a way that it has suﬃcient
expertise to properly perform its duties. The SB draws
up a generic profile for its members. This profile
specifies the required knowledge, suitability, expertise,
integrity and availability of the SB and its members.
It also sets out the relevant aspects of diversity
and inclusion, such as nationality, age, gender and
background related to education and professional
experience. At the end of 2022, 40% of the SB positions
were filled by women, in line with de Volksbank’s
objective for 2025 and the Act on Gender Balance.
De Volksbank’s Diversity and Inclusion Policy focuses
on recognising and valuing both customers’ and
employees’ diversity. This policy also applies to the
SB. The generic profile of the SB has been approved
by NLFI and is published on our website. The generic
profile of the SB was last amended on 1 November
2021. When a new member is appointed, the SB will
propose a candidate to the Annual General Meeting
(AGM), taking this profile into account.
The following changes in the composition of the SB
took place in 2022:
• 21 April 2022: the terms of office of Jos van Lange

86 de Volksbank N.V. Integrated Annual Report 2022
3.2 Report of the Supervisory
Board
Looking back and ahead with the
Chairman of the Supervisory Board
The end of the European Covid 19-related lockdown
measures, the start of the Russia-Ukraine war and the
subsequent sharp increase in energy prices, inflation
and interest rates meant that in 2022 everyone had
to operate in a very uncertain and quickly changing
economic and geopolitical environment. The same was
true for de Volksbank. Following years of low and
even negative interest rates, coupled with steadily
increasing house prices, the year 2022 marked a
fundamental change: interest rates rose sharply and
the housing market in the Netherlands started to cool
down.
In the second year of the implementation of our
strategy for 2021-2025, this meant that, based on the
updated macroeconomic projections for the coming
years, the financial outlook for our bank changed
significantly. On the one hand, rising interest rates
are by and large positive for the total income of de
Volksbank, on the other hand, higher inflation and
stalling economic growth will also have an upward
impact on operating expenses and expected loan
loss provisioning. The Supervisory Board has been
kept up to date about revised financial projections
for the coming years and is appreciative that the
financial objectives for 2025, in terms of Return on
Equity, cost-income ratio and solvency, have remained
unchanged and are still within reach. The Supervisory
Board approved the Operational Plan for 2023-2026 on
1 December.
De Volksbank has set itself the goal of becoming
the bank with the strongest customer relationship in
the Netherlands, with a substantial and measurable
positive impact on society. If we are to make this
happen, a number of changes are necessary.
First and foremost, the bank’s operations need to
be robust. To this end, we have chosen to build
an agile organisation. A change programme entitled
Klantificeren graag! was launched in 2021, and in
March 2022 virtually all parts of the bank adopted
the agile way of working. The Supervisory Board was
closely involved in the progress of the implementation
throughout the year and saw to it that the programme
was executed within the parameters of responsible
risk management, while considering the interests of
employees. In the course of the year, the Works
Council and the Supervisory Board had regular
meetings.
The choice for an agile way of working calls for
different behaviour and different leadership. To
better support the change programme, a new senior
management structure was set up, consisting of an
Executive Committee, with effect from 16 May 2022.
The Executive Committee consists of four statutory
members i.e. the CEO, CFO, CRO and CCO, and three
non-statutory members, i.e. the Chief Information
Officer (CIO), the Chief Transformation Officer (CTO)
and the Chief People & Organisation Officer (CPOO).
The recruitment process for the vacancies for the CFO,
CIO, CTO and CPOO positions was an explicit point of
focus for the Supervisory Board in 2022. By 1 October
2022, all vacancies were filled.
The Executive Committee is supported by a group
of senior managers, ‘de Volksbank Leadership Team’,
appointed after development assessments were
conducted in 2021. In 2022, the Supervisory Board
freed up considerable time to meet members of senior
management, with the aim to improve and intensify
cooperation with different management levels.
History has shown that a solid foundation contributes
to proper management dynamics. Guided by external
advice, the Supervisory Board implemented a
programme aimed at redefining the relationship
between the Executive Committee and the Supervisory
Board. In line with this, and in addition to its regular
supervisory duties, in 2022 the Supervisory Board
supervised the development of execution power and
leadership within the new agile organisation and of the
IT roadmap as cornerstones of the customer bank.
Other important preconditions to implement our
strategy are a strict compliance with laws and
regulations and the continuity of operations.
Necessary improvements in data quality, a programme
to improve customer integrity, fighting financial crime,
and the strengthening of our IT foundation remained
high on the agenda. Also in 2023, these topics will
remain key priorities and strong continued additional
investments will be required. The Supervisory Board
will stay closely involved in these topics.
In 2022, de Volksbank posted encouraging results
on its shared value ambitions for society, employees
and the shareholder. Net profit showed a significant
increase, underpinned by rising net interest income
and fee income and slightly declining operating
expenses. As in 2021, the positive impact of incidental

and non-recurring items was substantial. The picture
for the customer was more diverse: the number
of active multi-customers increased in line with our
ambition, but customer satisfaction rates declined,
impacted by the introduction of a fixed monthly fee
for a basic banking package.
The strategy for 2021-2025 addresses the challenges
the bank faces with its traditional revenue model,
making choices aimed at a growth of fee income
and expansion of SME lending. Both fee income and
SME lending increased substantially in 2022, but a
rebound in interest income prevented a higher relative
importance of these income categories.
An important challenge for the years ahead is finding
and implementing concrete measures to improve
our customer relationship and positive impact on
society. In 2022, the brands of de Volksbank, i.e. SNS,
ASN Bank, RegioBank and BLG Wonen, took many
initiatives to reach out to their customers, digitally
and through their network of shops and branches, on
topics ranging from financial resilience to sustainable
investing. The Supervisory Board appreciates these
initiatives and has challenged the Executive Committee
in a positive and critical way to do more on this
subject.
On 7 July 2022, the Dutch Minister of Finance
informed the House of Representatives about NLFI’s
most recent progress report on de Volksbank. In
this report, dated 30 June 2022, NLFI stated that de
Volksbank made a good start in creating a more robust
organisation and strengthening its social identity since
the introduction of the new strategy. NLFI noted that
full implementation of the strategy will require several
years and the Minister of Finance agreed that de
Volksbank should be given time to bring this about.
On 22 February 2023, the Minister of Finance,
following up on the letter of 7 July 2022, wrote
to the House of Representatives that, in order to
avoid unnecessary delay and provide clarity to de
Volksbank, she intends to take a directional decision
about the future of de Volksbank before the end of
2023. In the decision, all options for the future and
all governance models will be taken into account.
We agree with the Minister that this is the right
moment and, in preparation for this decision, de
Volksbank will make more concrete plans for the
positioning of its social identity, including its stance on
the feasibility of different ownership and governance
options. De Volksbank will submit these to NLFI before
the summer. The Supervisory Board is closely involved
in this process.
As for many other companies, the tension on the
labour market is a major attention point for de
Volksbank. Applicable laws on remuneration in certain
key positions make this even more complicated.
Maintaining and strengthening our position as an
attractive employer will remain key in 2023 and
beyond.
In 2022, there were no personnel changes in the
Supervisory Board. On 21 April 2022, the terms of
office of Jos van Lange and Aloys Kregting expired and
both were reappointed. On 31 October 2022, Jos van
Lange was appointed Vice Chair of the Supervisory
Board.
The Supervisory Board wishes to express its gratitude
for the tremendous dedication and commitment
shown by management and employees. Putting our
mission of ‘Banking with a human touch’ and our
promise ‘Better for each other’ in practice entirely
depends on their daily efforts.
On behalf of the Supervisory Board of de Volksbank,
Gerard van Olphen,
Chair

Supervisory quality assurance and self-
assessment
A lifelong learning (LL) programme is in place to
deepen and broaden SB's knowledge. In 2022, the SB,
together with the ExCo, attended LL sessions in which
the following subjects were successively discussed:
• Customer relationship and social impact
• Socially responsible management and supervision
• Integrating ESG factors into business operations;
opportunities and risks
• Financial and economic crime
The SB assesses its own functioning on an annual
basis. At least every three years, this evaluation is
carried out under the supervision of an external
consultant. In 2021, an external accredited consultancy
firm developed a plan of approach to support the
SB and the ExCo in their cooperation, which was set
to run up to and including the fourth quarter of
2022. This plan comprised of various activities such as
interviews and separate and joint sessions for both the
SB and the ExCo.
Employees and employee participation
As in 2021, 2022 was a year in which Covid-19 affected
de Volksbank’s employees. 2022 was also a year in
which the Works Council expressed an opinion on
the request for advice on the implementation of an
agile way of working as part of the Strategic Plan
2021-2025. Customer relationships and social impact
were important topics too. Similar to 2021, the Works
Council was closely involved and consulted in these
initiatives in 2022.
The Works Council exercised its right to speak at the
AGM of 21 April 2022 and stressed the importance
for the employee to be an indispensable link to
make social impact and strengthen the customer
relationship. During this meeting the Works Council
also looked back on the activities it had performed in
the period May 2021 – April 2022.
In 2022, the Works Council, the ExCo and the
Supervisory Board met on a regular basis in various
combinations. The topics discussed in these meetings
included:
• Covid-19-related scenarios and the New Way of
Working (HNW) Policy 2.0
• Execution of the Strategic Plan 2021-2025, including
the request for advice and approval of the
implementation of an agile way of working as part
of the Strategic Plan 2021-2025
• Financial and commercial updates
• Social framework
• 2021 Annual report of the Works Council
• Results of the 2022 employee surveys
• Results of the 2022 agile working surveys
• Performance management
• Social impact
• Safe working environment
• Employee participation
• Absenteeism
• Long-term office housing plan
• Collective labour agreement
Committees of the Supervisory Board
The SB has formed the following committees from
within its own ranks: the Audit Committee (AC), the
Risk & Compliance Committee (R&CC) and the People
& Organisation Committee (P&OC).
The task of these committees is to prepare the
decision-making of the SB and to support the SB by
providing advice on various topics. The SB has drawn
up rules of procedure for each of these committees
and appoints the chairs.

received regular updates, either in writing or verbally
from EY, the external auditor. Top risks related to
both the internal control risks and financial risks were
explicitly addressed. Also, the quarterly results were
discussed in depth each quarter. The design, existence
and operation of the internal control systems were
also regularly on the agenda, with the AC paying
specific attention to the improvement programmes

Relationship and consultations with the
shareholder
NL Financial Investments (NLFI) is the sole shareholder
of de Volksbank. In addition to the Articles of
Association (AoA) of de Volksbank, which contain a
list of the duties of the ExCo and the rules governing
its functioning, NLFI and de Volksbank signed a
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). This MoU
contains agreements on the way in which the ExCo
should exercise its powers ensuing from the AoA in
the day-to-day operations. Consultations between the
SB and NLFI take place periodically in accordance with
an annual meeting calendar. In these meetings the
Chair of the SB discusses various topics including the
assessment of the ExCo and the SB. In addition, de
Volksbank’s AGM is prepared in consultation with NLFI.
In 2022, the AGM was held on 21 April.
As the sole shareholder of de Volksbank, NLFI reports
to the Minister of Finance every year by means of a
progress report. This report provides an overview of
the extent to which de Volksbank is implementing its
strategy and assesses whether de Volksbank is ready
for a future independent of the Dutch State. On 7 July
2022, the Minister of Finance informed the House of
Representatives of the state of affairs based on NLFI’s
progress report dated June 2022. In this report, dated
30 June 2022, NLFI stated that de Volksbank made a
good start in creating a more robust organisation and
strengthening its social identity since the introduction
of the Strategic Plan 2021 – 2025. NLFI remarked
that further measures will be necessary to achieve
a structural improvement of the financial results and
that market dynamics, i.e. higher inflation, higher
interest rates, geo-political developments, may have
an impact and may require further adjustments. The
implementation of the strategy and the subsequent
improvement of financial results will require several
years and the Minister of Finance noted that de
Volksbank should be given time to bring this about.
Therefore it is too early for a decision on the
privatisation of the bank.
Financial statements and dividend
proposal
Prior to publication, the 2022 financial statements
were discussed in meetings of the ExCo, AC and SB.
On 9 March 2023, EY – de Volksbank’s external auditor
in 2022 - issued an unqualified auditor’s report on
the 2022 financial statements. On the same date the
members of the Supervisory Board approved and
signed the financial statements. At the AGM on 21 April
2022, NLFI agreed to de Volksbank's proposal to pay
out a dividend of € 97 million to NLFI charged to the
annual result of de Volksbank for 2021. The profit after
dividend distribution for the 2021 financial year was
added to the other reserves.

3.4 Remuneration Report
Introduction
This Remuneration Report of de Volksbank N.V. (de
Volksbank) covers the remuneration of the Executive
Committee (ExCo) and the Supervisory Board of de
Volksbank. The statutory members of the ExCo and
members of the Supervisory Board do not have an
employment contract and receive remuneration for
their services. The non-statutory members of the
ExCo do have an employment contract and receive a
salary. For the sake of readability, this report refers to
remuneration for all ExCo members.
De Volksbank’s mission is 'Banking with a human
touch' and this includes 'remuneration with a human
touch'. In establishing the remuneration policy and
the actual remuneration, we take into account our
stakeholders, i.e. customers, society, employees and
the shareholder. We like to keep things simple
and want to show that our strategy enables us to
attract and retain good people without offering them
higher pay than the industry average (see below
under Remuneration benchmarking). We ensure equal
pay in equal situations, and remuneration and/or
performance assessments are not affected by, for
example, gender differences or ethnic background.
The aforementioned also applies to the ExCo.
The remuneration of the ExCo is in reasonable
proportion to the salaries of our employees and the
average remuneration in the Netherlands (see below
under Pay ratios). De Volksbank does not offer any
variable remuneration as we do not consider variable
remuneration linked to performance agreements to be
in keeping with the social character of our bank.
Remuneration policy of the Executive
Committee
Remuneration elements
Members of the ExCo are appointed for a term
of four years. Statutory members have a contract
of service and non-statutory members have an
employment agreement. The remuneration consists of
a management fee or fixed annual income, a pension
contribution and fringe benefits, such as a supplement
as compensation for the loss of pension accrual over
and above € 114,866 and a lease car.
Remuneration
Like our employees’ salaries, the remuneration of
members of the ExCo was increased by 1.5% with
effect from 1 July 2022. As from that date, the
remuneration of the ExCo members is as follows:
• Chair € 437,328
• Statutory members € 335,647; and
• Non-statutory members € 295,670
The remuneration for statutory members of the ExCo
as stated above is below the amount as stated in
the remuneration policy, i.e. € 358,002. Increasing the
remuneration of the members of the ExCo - other than
collective increases - is not possible, as the bonus ban

and salary freeze as set out in the Dutch Financial
Supervision Act (Wft) applies. On the one hand, it is
understandable that restrictions have been imposed
in return for the State aid received, and de Volksbank
itself decided it does not want to reward its employees
at the higher end of the market. On the other hand,
we - as de Volksbank - must also take into account the
reality of that market. The bonus ban and salary freeze
mean that the remuneration may not be increased
other than in line with collective increases. As a result,
in the longer term, remuneration may be further
out of line with that of comparable positions in the
market. Especially in view of the tight labour market, it
may become increasingly difficult to attract and retain
directors.
Remuneration benchmarking
Once every two years we compare the remuneration
of the ExCo members with the remuneration
of comparable positions in the general market.
The general market consists of a combination of
comparable financial and non-financial corporations.
This benchmark was last performed in May 2021, with
the following results:
• the remuneration of the Chair was 24% below
the general market median. Looking not only at
the fixed remuneration, but also at the variable
remuneration in the market, remuneration was 59%
below the general market median.
• the remuneration of the statutory members of the
ExCo was 21% below the median of the general
market. Looking not only at the fixed remuneration,
but also at the variable remuneration in the market,
remuneration was 51% below the general market
median.
• the remuneration of non-statutory members of the
ExCo was established in 2022, after the benchmark
of 2021. This remuneration was 2% above the
general market median of 2021. This was due to
the collective increase in July 2022. Looking not only
at the fixed remuneration, but also at the variable
remuneration in the market, remuneration was 33%
below the general market median of 2021.
Pension
ExCo members participate in the same pension
scheme as the employees of de Volksbank. No
additional pension is granted. To compensate for the
lack of pension accrual over and above the € 114,866
cap, members of the ExCo receive a gross supplement
of 16.35% of their remuneration over and above that
amount.
Other
The fringe benefits of the ExCo members are for
the most part equivalent to the fringe benefits of de
Volksbank employees.
In the event of termination of employment contract
at de Volksbank’s initiative, the ExCo members
will receive no more than one year’s fixed annual
remuneration as compensation.
Performance objectives
Each year, the Supervisory Board sets the performance
objectives for the ExCo. These objectives are derived
from de Volksbank’s (long-term) strategic objectives,
and in setting them the Supervisory Board takes into
account the desired risk profile and sustainability of de
Volksbank. These two themes are secured every year.
The Supervisory Board also considers the interests of
all stakeholders of de Volksbank.
As ExCo members are only entitled to fixed
remuneration, there are no unwanted incentives that
could place short-term individual interests above any
of the long-term collective objectives.
At the end of each performance period, the
Supervisory Board assesses the performance of the
ExCo in achieving its performance objectives, as well as
the progress on its long-term objectives.

In this context, the Supervisory Board assesses the
extent to which the performance objectives were
achieved and the way in which conduct and culture
within de Volksbank were managed in line with
‘banking with a human touch’ (competencies and
critical success factors). The Supervisory Board has
assessed the overall achievements for 2022 and
has concluded that the ExCo achieved 53% of the
objectives.
The following tables show the performance objectives
that have been set for 2023.

It is our standard that the Chair of the ExCo does not
earn more than approximately ten times the median
salary8 of de Volksbank employees. De Volksbank also
reports on the pay ratio between the:
8 Employees’ salaries and the remuneration of the ExCo
consist of the following components: fixed salary or
management fee (including any supplements), pension and
social security contributions. The OECD figure does not
include pension and social security contributions and for
that comparison, de Volksbank uses the same definition as
the OECD.
• average remuneration of the ExCo members
(excluding the Chair) and the median of the salaries
of employees;
• remuneration of the Chair of the ExCo and the
maximum of the lowest pay scale as at 31-12-2022;

average pay in the Netherlands according to the
OECD;
• average remuneration of the Chair of the ExCo

Supervision on remuneration
Both the Supervisory Board and the ExCo are
responsible for the supervision of remuneration at de
Volksbank. Other parties involved are the People and
Organisation Committee (P&OC) of the Supervisory
Board, the control departments of Risk, Compliance
and Audit, and the staff departments of Finance,
Legal Affairs and Human Resources. Moreover, the
Remuneration policy is discussed at least once a year
by the Risk & Compliance Committee (R&CC) of the
Supervisory Board. Last year, the policy was discussed
in both the P&OC and R&CC.
Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board adopts the Remuneration
report and is responsible for the implementation
and evaluation of the Remuneration policy for the
members of the ExCo.
The Supervisory Board also approves the
Remuneration policy for the directors as proposed
by the ExCo, and supervises implementation thereof.
Moreover, the Supervisory Board is responsible for
approving the broad lines of the Remuneration policy
for de Volksbank employees as proposed by the ExCo.
At least once a year, the Supervisory Board will
arrange a central and independent internal review
by Audit, which verifies the implementation of de
Volksbank's remuneration policy for compliance with
laws and regulations, policy making and procedures
for remuneration.
The Supervisory Board discusses any material
retention, signing-on and buy-out fees, and sees to it
that any such fees are in keeping with the adopted
Remuneration policy of de Volksbank and are not
excessive. Any such fees are granted on very rare
occasions only.
The Supervisory Board directly supervises the
remuneration of the directors of Risk, Compliance and
Audit who hold overall responsibility. In doing so, the
Supervisory Board may call upon the expertise of
independent remuneration experts where necessary.
ExCo
The ExCo is responsible for the Remuneration policy of
de Volksbank with the exception of the Remuneration
policy for the ExCo itself.
In exceptional situations and on good grounds, the
ExCo has the discretionary power, in so far as it
does not relate to the members of the ExCo itself,
to deviate from the adopted Remuneration policy, to
the extent that laws and regulations permit. In the
case of employees falling outside the scope of the

collective labour agreement (high earners), approval
will be sought from the Supervisory Board.
The ExCo is responsible for the application of the
reasonableness test for the directors and Identified
Staff in general, and - as far as directors and
other employees are concerned - for the approval of
benchmarks on market conformity and the approval of
non-material retention, signing-on and buy-out fees.
Control and staff departments
The Remuneration policy and compliance therewith
is jointly monitored by the control departments of
Risk and Compliance and the staff departments of
Finance, Legal Affairs and Human Resources through a
Remuneration Working Group. The Audit department
periodically performs independent audits into the
drawing up and implementation of the Remuneration
policy.
3.5 Sustainability governance
Governance is an important topic not only for
de Volksbank itself, but also for the companies that we
invest in or finance.
In this section we describe how de Volksbank has
set up its sustainability governance. Our sustainability
criteria include our expectations of good governance
that aids the shift to a more sustainable world.
When assessing companies’ governance, we expect
each company to have a policy that regulates the
ethical conduct for its employees, no matter where the
company operates or is located. We expect companies
to be transparent about their performance as far
as governance, climate change, human rights and
biodiversity are concerned. For more information, see
our Guide on Sustainability Criteria.
The development and implementation of sustainability
is assigned to owners within the Executive Committee
(ExCo) and senior management. The Social Impact
Committee (SIC) is a risk committee with a broad
mandate that oversees our impact on society and the
impact of sustainability matters on de Volksbank. It
meets 8 times a year, or more frequent if required.
The SIC is responsible for the progress of strategic
targets for social (inside-out) impact, for monitoring
the incorporation of ESG matters in business
processes and for the risk management framework
(outside-in) as well as for fostering transparency on
compliance with the non-financial reporting guidelines.
The committee is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer,
representing the ExCo. Vice-chair of the SIC is the Hub
Lead ASN Bank, representing de Volksbank's brands.
Other members of the SIC include representatives
from Strategy, Finance, Corporate Communication, de
Volksbank Financial Markets, Risk and Compliance.
Audit has a standing invitation. All members of the SIC
may escalate (pending) decisions to the ExCo.
The ExCo holds responsibility for achieving the
overall sustainability objectives of de Volksbank and
establishing that these are in line with risk appetite.
The Chief Risk Officer was made responsible for
sustainability in 2021, this includes involvement in
approval and selection of the material topics and
the progress on these topics as included in our
annual reporting. The expected impact on our four
stakeholder groups, i.e. customers, society, employees
and the shareholder, is included in the decision-
making during all ExCo and SIC meetings to ensure
that the impact on natural, human and social capital is
taken into consideration. Every year, we evaluate our
social impact-related policies and activities against our
shared value KPIs and adjust them where necessary.
The ExCo discusses topics related to long term value
or impacts on a regular basis with the four stakeholder
groups throughout the year.
As from 2022, a multidisciplinary Advisory Team
(AT) Sustainability provides the SIC with advice on
sustainability matters. The members of this team
are representatives from the first line of defence,
the business and the supporting teams. Risk and
Compliance have independent control functions. Legal
affairs is also part of this team in anticipation of all the
(upcoming) ESG legislation. The team meets 2 weeks
ahead of the SIC.

3.6 Codes and regulations
Banking code
In 2015, the Dutch Banking Association (NVB)
introduced a entitled called Future-oriented Banking.
Apart from the Banking Code, this package contains
a Social Charter and rules of conduct for people
employed in the Dutch banking sector. Through this
package, the Dutch banking sector aims to restore
confidence and trust in the financial sector.
The Social Charter is a roadmap to achieve the banking
sector's desired social position and shared value
vision. The rules of conduct are associated with the
Banker's Oath.
The NVB introduced the first version of the Banking
Code in 2010. This code contains various principles
on corporate governance, risk management, audit
and remuneration. The Banking Code is a form of
self- regulation, to which banks themselves apply the
'comply or explain' principle.
De Volksbank complies with the principles of the
Banking Code. For more detailed information on how
de Volksbank applies the Banking Code, please refer
to the overview on our website www.devolksbank.nl.
As compliance with the Banking Code is a dynamic
process due to ongoing new developments, this
overview is regularly updated.
Dutch Corporate Governance Code
The revised Dutch Corporate Governance Code
2022 (DCGC) as drawn up by the Dutch Corporate
Governance Code Monitoring Committee, was
published on 20 December 2022. The Code consists
of principles and ‘best practice’ provisions regarding
the corporate governance of Dutch listed companies.
Compliance with the DCGC is based on the ‘comply or
explain’ principle pursuant to which listed companies
are obliged to state how they apply the DCGC.
Although de Volksbank is not a listed company, and its
shares are privately held by NLFI, the bank voluntarily
applies the DCGC in full.
For more detailed information on how de Volksbank
applies the DCGC, please refer to the overview on
our website www.devolksbank.nl. As compliance with
the DCGC is a dynamic process due to ongoing new
developments, this overview is regularly updated.
Responsible tax policy
De Volksbank and its brands ensure compliance with
the laws and regulations governing their business
operations and activities. Being a social bank, we
believe that this includes a responsible tax policy that
benefits the organisation, our customers and society.
Health, safety, education and other public expenditure
are paid for from tax revenues, and we are well aware
of that. So, we are happy to pay our fair share of tax.
Our tax policy is approved by the ExCo and reviewed
by the Audit Committee.
The spirit of the law
Naturally, we comply with all relevant tax laws and
regulations. In addition, we check if we comply
with the spirit of these laws, in other words, with
the real meaning or intention. We believe it is not
appropriate to push the limits on taxation. We have
no objection to being granted a tax benefit as intended
by tax legislation, but we will never devise or set up
aggressive tax structures or use tax havens to obtain
one. Nor do we let tax considerations play a decisive
role.
However, we do take into account tax aspects in
relation to some of our customer products, such as
potential tax-deductible interest on mortgages.
Tax rate
We do not aim for the lowest possible effective
tax rate nor an artificial effective tax rate reduction.
Effective tax rate planning is not part of our
corporate objectives. As there are many differences
between accounting- and tax rules, the result in
the financial statements may differ from the taxable
result, resulting in a lower or higher effective tax rate
compared to the statutory tax rate.
Dutch Tax Authorities
De Volksbank maintains a proactive and open
relationship with the Dutch tax authorities, which is
characterised by transparency and mutual trust. We
formalised this by signing a so-called Horizontal Tax
Monitoring (HTM) agreement, a form of cooperative
tax compliance.
In 2020, the Dutch tax authorities introduced a new,
more strict approach to HTM, tightening the applied
method. De Volksbank’s current agreement with the
Dutch tax authorities will be reviewed in 2023.
De Volksbank and the Dutch tax authorities have
regular meetings, where potentially important (new)
tax position developments and other tax-related topics
are discussed. In these discussions, we do not only
highlight our own point of view, but we also highlight
arguments that may argue against our own tax
position. When we make mistakes, we will try to find
a solution in consultation with the tax authorities
and pay the taxes potentially due. We will accept the
consequences and learn from our mistakes to prevent
them in the future. If our customers are affected by
this, we will ensure that the impact will be as limited as
possible.
Tax control and risk management
Our tax control measures are intended to keep
track of potential future changes in legislation, to
be tax compliant, to identify risks and impact and
to minimise errors. All our tax control measures
combined constitute our Tax Control Framework,
which is part of HTM and de Volksbank’s Integrated
Control Framework.
This all contributes to the mitigation of tax risks, the
filing of timely, correct and complete tax returns and
tax compliant products for our customers. Examples
of these tax control measures are training sessions

and presentations for the business and management,
regular participation in various internal and external
meetings and the mandatory tax sign-off in the
Product Approval and Review Process.
The tax control measures are reviewed by the
Operational Risk department. A Risk Control Self-
Assessment (RCSA) is also performed on an annual
basis.
Any concerns about unethical or unlawful tax-related
behaviour of the organisation can be voiced through
the regular processes and procedures of incident
and loss management as well as through the
whistleblowing procedure.
International aspects
In recent years, the focus on tax policies of
internationally operating corporations, and on
international tax evasion in particular, has increased.
De Volksbank endorses international legislative
initiatives on this issue, such as the OECD's and
EU’s tax initiatives and new or amended domestic
legislation resulting from these initiatives, even though
not all of these are equally relevant to de Volksbank as
we operate mainly in the Netherlands.
We are obliged to report potentially aggressive cross-
border tax arrangements to the Dutch tax authorities
under the Mandatory Disclosure Rules (MDR/DAC6).
Cross-border tax arrangements involve residents of
various countries and may potentially be used for
tax evasion purposes by customers, counterparties or
business partners. Looking at de Volksbank’s product
range and customer profiles throughout the years,
we expect the number of reports to be very limited.
In 2022, de Volksbank did not report any such
arrangements under these regulations.
Taxes paid in 2022
The 2022 total corporate income tax expense of de
Volksbank amounted to € 67 million. The effective tax
rate was 26.0%, slightly above the 2022 nominal rate
of 25.8%. For 2021, the effective tax rate was 25.8%,
with a statutory rate of 25%. As de Volksbank has no
foreign branches nor participations, it is not subject to
any foreign income tax and is therefore not required to
draw up a country-by-country report.
Apart from corporate income tax, de Volksbank is
subject to several other taxes. These taxes and
amounts for 2022 are as follows:
• Payroll tax and social security contributions:
€ 103 million (2021: € 98 million). These are
withheld from employees’ wages but, being part of
the salary costs, are for the account of and paid by
de Volksbank.
• Non-recoverable VAT: € 47 million (2021:
€ 51 million). Financial services that de Volksbank
provides are mostly exempt from VAT. In principle,
VAT charged by suppliers to the bank cannot be
reclaimed from the tax authorities. Therefore, the
non-deductible VAT leads to an additional cost for
de Volksbank.
• In 2022, consistent with last year, de Volksbank does
not owe any bank tax over 2021 as de Volksbank
remains below the exemption threshold of the levy.
Tax risk policy on customers and transactions
De Volksbank's procedures and measures to identify,
verify and report customers tax status are compliant
with applicable Dutch and international regulations,
such as the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and the
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA).
Within the context of the Know Your Customer (KYC)
principle for business owners, we also monitor tax
attitude and behaviour. De Volksbank does not provide
direct tax advice to customers, nor do we facilitate
international tax-aggressive structures.
De Volksbank does not want to invest in or provide
loans to businesses involved in tax evasion, nor do
we support transactions where tax savings are the
main objective. A transaction or standpoint should
be robust, have sufficient substance and should not
have any other negative effects. By this we mean the
following:
• The standpoint or transaction is robust if it is
consistent with the relevant (tax) laws, regulations
and (tax) case law. Prior consultation with the tax
authorities could take place.
• The standpoint or transaction in question must
have sufficient substance from an economic,
business, or social perspective.
• Prior to the transaction or to forming a standpoint
a reasonable assessment should be made whether
there is a chance of reputational damage or any
other material negative consequences.

IFRS 7 AND PILLAR 3
To combine disclosures where possible and to reduce
duplication, the IAS 1 and IFRS 7 information regarding
capital management and risks related to financial
instruments have been integrated in this chapter. Only
if mentioned in the text or if the label ‘Audited’ is
shown at a table is the information part of the audited
financial statements.
In addition, a separate Pillar 3 Report has been
published on the website www.devolksbank.nl,
containing additional information about the risks, risk
management and capital adequacy of the bank. This
information is required on the basis of CRD IV and CRR,
but is not part of the audit performed by the external
auditor.
4.1 Risk management structure
4.1.1 Risk management elements
De Volksbank aims to live up to its ‘banking with
a human touch’ mission. We are a retail bank with
sustainable business operations that provides services
to private individuals, self-employed persons and small
businesses in the Netherlands. We engage in activities
that create benefits for customers, take responsibility
for society, provide meaning for employees and
achieve stable returns for the shareholder(s) over
a long-term horizon. As a bank with a strong
social identity, we want to build a strong customer
relationship and increase the social impact we make.
Risk appetite statement
Our risk management recognises developments that
might impede that mission and identifies initiatives
that fit in with de Volksbank's objectives. In doing
so, we take into account the interests of all four
stakeholders: customers, society, employees and
shareholder. This results in the following overall
qualitative Risk Appetite Statement for de Volksbank:
With simple and sustainable products and transparent
processes we earn our customers’ confidence. In
our relationship with customers, we act upon trust
and embrace their interests. We focus on providing
sound solutions within the financial capabilities of
the customers. We have controlled and predictable
operations, committed and agile employees, a solid
capitalisation and an adequate liquidity position. Being
a systemically relevant bank with a non-diversified
business model, we accept a higher concentration risk
and moderate risk profile that accompanies this business
model, including its vulnerabilities.
Risk management and shared value
De Volksbank aims for an integrated risk management
approach in which all risks within the bank’s risk
taxonomy are managed in accordance with our shared
value ambition:
BENEFITS FOR CUSTOMERS
We work towards a sound and long-term customer
relationship that is based on mutual trust, we
are better equipped to support our customers
in controlling their personal finances. We aim for
clear and transparent risk management.
RESPONSIBILITY FOR SOCIETY
We follow up on the development of products
and services that increase our customers' financial
resilience. This includes careful risk considerations
and close monitoring of laws and regulations.
GENUINE ATTENTION FOR OUR EMPLOYEES
We need motivated and competent people to
live up to our mission. We encourage employees’
commitment and the development of their
expertise by giving them genuine attention.
RETURN FOR THE SHAREHOLDER
We aim for a solid capital position, an adequate
liquidity position and a simple and transparent
balance sheet. This is how we contribute to a
financially sound and stable bank with activities
that yield stable returns in the long term.
Risk management framework
To manage risks, de Volksbank applies the COSO9
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework. We
have set up a Risk Management Cycle (RMC) to
properly apply all COSO ERM elements and this serves
as a generic tool for both the first line and the
second line of defence. The RMC ensures consistent
terminology and provides a compatible methodology
for the identification, assessment, measurement,
monitoring, management and reporting of all risks.

Risk governance
De Volksbank’s risk governance is based on the
three lines of defence model. In this model, the first
line (the business) is responsible for setting up and
executing its own processes and the identification
and assessment of the risks involved. The business
measures the risks against the risk appetite that has
been determined, and reports on them. The second
line, consisting of the Risk Management Function
and the Compliance Function, supports the business,
sets the frameworks, gives advice and monitors if
the business takes its responsibility. More specifically,
the Compliance Function, monitors if de Volksbank
complies with laws and regulations as well as its
internal policies on integrity. The third line, the Audit
Function, independently assesses if the first and
second lines are operating effectively.
As from the second quarter of 2022, the Board of
Directors as a governing body was re-named Executive
Board (ExBo) and was extended to an Executive
Committee (ExCo). All risk related subjects are
discussed in the ExCo meeting. The ExBo retains the
authority to adopt risk related resolutions. However,
a risk related resolution of the ExCo, validly adopted
in accordance with the ExCo Rules of Procedure will
be deemed to be a resolution of the ExBo. For more
information, see Section 3. Governance.
As the ExBo is ultimately accountable for risk
management within the organisation, it therefore
functions as an overarching bank risk committee, and
as such is supported by risk committees composed of
representatives from the first and second lines in each
committee.
The Supervisory Board is charged with the supervision
of the ExCo and in that role are provided
with advice by the Audit Committee, the Risk
and Compliance Committee and the People and
Organisation Committee.
Each ExCo-related risk committee is chaired by an ExCo
member. The third line has a standing invitation for
committee meetings and is regularly represented in
the risk committees, but has no voting rights. Risk
committee meetings are held between the business,
which controls the risks, and the Risk Management
Function, which monitors the risks and related risk
response. Decision-making related to and/or with
impact on risk management follows the lines of risk
governance and is assessed against risk guidelines. If,
and when, risk limits are exceeded or the risk appetite
is not otherwise observed, risk committees discuss
the issue and any subsequent remedial actions to be
taken. A risk committee may escalate or otherwise
present a point of discussion to the ExCo if and
when necessary. Every year, the Risk Management
Function performs a complete self-assessment for all
risk committees and areas for improvement will be
defined if necessary.
Changes resulting from the transformation into an
agile organisation
In 2022, de Volksbank completed the first phase in
the transformation towards an agile way of working,
which also had an effect on the risk organisation
and risk governance. The governing three lines of
defence principles continued to be applied and the risk
committees remained unchanged. We did, however,
implement changes in the underlying processes, staff
functions' responsibilities and memberships of new

staff functions in the risk committees. We set up
one new committee for outsourcing risk and one
subcommittee for privacy. We also integrated some
other subcommittees in the organisation’s dialogues.
The design for the risk and compliance domain
was completed resulting in two Centres of Expertise
for the Risk Management Function and Compliance
Function respectively. All second line tasks haven been
accommodated in these two Centres of Expertise.
Risk awareness and culture
Risk culture propagation
De Volksbank's Risk Management Function is an
integral but independent part of the organisation. On
the one hand, the Risk Management Function informs,
challenges, takes positions and gives solicited and
unsolicited advice, and on the other hand it is essential
that they listen and seek connections. They have an
eye for all stakeholders and try to find solutions
that do justice to the various stakeholder interests
and contribute to the realisation of the strategy. Risk
awareness and self-reflection is an important part of
the culture.
Culture is a decisive factor in risk management and risk
awareness. We want the risk culture to be propagated
by the entire organisation. The ExCo leads by example
and, like any other employee, they take on their role
and responsibilities. The ExCo approves our Risk Policy
Framework. The presence of members of the ExCo
in all risk committees testifies to their commitment
to risk management. The Risk Management Function
and the Compliance Function act together to improve
and support the risk awareness and culture within
the organisation. In 2023, we will continue to invest
in the culture, including the risk culture, by rolling
out a programme aimed at leadership and senior
management.
Risk Policy Framework
De Volksbank has risk policies in place on its
risk appetite, duties and responsibilities, reporting,
communication and various other guidelines. Our risk
policies reflect our position as a social bank with
low-risk activities. We continuously fine-tune our risk
policies. We encourage a critical consideration of the
risk-return ratio by focusing on our customers, society,
our employees and the shareholder.
Raising risk awareness among employees ensures they
are familiar with and understand the risk guidelines.
We provide training courses, workshops and e-learning
programmes to further raise risk awareness and help
employees respond better and more consciously to
risks. We also share risk awareness-related success
stories and lessons learned with our employees.
This framework is carefully maintained and
continuously improved, and new rules and regulations
are embedded into the policies.
Internal code of conduct
We expect our employees to behave ethically. In
doing so, they are guided by our code of conduct
entitled Common Sense, Clear Conscience, which pays
attention to moral dilemmas and how to deal with
them. A well-spread network of confidants offers staff
the opportunity to raise concerns about malpractices.
The annual survey on the culture of integrity in the
organisation shows that the employees are familiar
with and agree with the content of the code of
conduct. In general, de Volksbank employees are
motivated to comply with the code of conduct and
experience that management acts accordingly.
Remuneration policy
De Volksbank pursues a remuneration policy that is
based on our Manifesto, and the strategy to build a
strong customer relationship and increase the social
impact of the bank. De Volksbank does not grant any
variable remuneration so as to discourage employees
from taking undesirable risks that may give priority
to short-term individual interests over long-term
collective objectives. For more detailed information on
our remuneration policy, see Section 3.4 Remuneration
report.
Risk profile
De Volksbank focuses primarily on private individuals,
self-employed persons and small businesses in the
Netherlands. We offer a limited but relevant range of
products and services: mortgages, payments, savings,
small business financing, retail investments and
insurances. We accept the risk profile that matches a
business model of low-risk activities, limited product
range and geographical diversification.
In our business operations, we run the risk of harming
our financial and non-financial interests in several
areas, including our reputation. We have identified
these risks and continuously seek to take timely and
adequate control measures.
4.1.2 Top risks
De Volksbank primarily carries out regulated and
supervised activities that may be impacted by internal
and external developments. These developments and
related risks may prevent us from reaching our
strategic objectives. For more information on the
strategic objectives, see Section 1.3 Our strategic
progress. To anticipate these developments and
related risks, de Volksbank annually carries out a
Strategic Risk Assessment (SRA), which identifies and
assesses the top risks in relation to its strategy.
De Volksbank assesses top risks related to these
developments and adjusts the risk taxonomy if
necessary. We then take measures to align our strategy
and risk appetite with the potential impact of any such
top risks. In this section, we describe the top risks of
2022. The effects of mitigating measures were taken
into account.

TOP RISKS RESULTING FROM EXTERNAL DEVELOPMENTS
Event Description of risk and impact Measures
Geopolitical developments
and inflationary pressure
Geopolitical developments (war in Ukraine) and
(consequent) price increases affect the state of
the Dutch economy and our customers' financial
health. There is a risk that customers have difficulty
in meeting their financial obligations, which could
result in missed payments.
At the start of the geopolitical developments, the
second line intensified monitoring and reporting to
the ExCo. Currently, the reporting frequency has been
scaled down. There has been an extra management
overlay on the mortgage provisions to cover the risks
involved.
Our Arrears Management department has monitored
developments even more closely and made
operational preparations for a possible increase in
inflow.
We have kept an extra eye on groups of SME
customers and industrial sectors.
The Risk Management Function continues to report
on changes in the circumstances, which could change
the context and the actions the bank is currently
taken.
Interest result depends
on a yield curve that
is currently volatile and
inverse
There is a risk that high interest rate volatility
results in dependence on the interest income from
movements in money market rates and actions
from peers. As a result, the stability of net interest
margin may decrease and therefore a main source
of profitability may depend on external factors.
Strategic forecasts and stress testing provide insight
into the impact.
Actions have been taken to limit the inflow of excess
liquidity and to reduce the dependence on net
interest income.
We monitor developments in the macroeconomic
environment to anticipate trends affecting the
interest rate profile, and to align commercial and
pricing policies to these developments.
We use linear and non-linear instruments to hedge
the interest rate exposure.
High demand on
organisation due to
the increased level of
regulatory and supervisory
pressure
There is a risk that the bank must meet
requirements that place a high demand on the
organisation. This could ultimately result in high
costs and sanctions, or in delays in the execution of
the strategy.
We have coordinated and centralised all
communication with the supervisory authorities.
We are closely following up on the development of
new regulations and an extra implementation budget
with resources is incorporated in our strategic plans.
Cybercrime and criminal
threats
There is a risk that de Volksbank is not able
to adapt rapidly and adequately enough to
cybercrime and other criminal threats and that
customer relationships suffer as a result. This could
affect the availability of our systems and the data
or funds of our customers and the bank.
There is an cyber security organisation in place. We
are in the process of implementing a continuous
improvement plan.
Scarce competences and
permanent employability
of employees
There is a risk that labour market conditions
will hinder the ability to attract and retain
employees. Employers in the financial sector and
beyond are competing to fill vacancies and retain
people, especially in the field of IT, data analytics,
compliance and risk. This could cause the bank's
performance and change capacity to lag behind.
We encourage employees to develop themselves and
embrace lifelong learning. We put effort in being an
attractive employer for new and existing staff. For
more information see Section 2.2.2 Our activities and
employees.

and effectiveness of the organisation is inadequate,
or that employee dedication and engagement
decreases.
Agile working methods have been implemented
to improve the ability to change. The risk of
transitioning towards agile working methods, got
undivided attention and the full benefits are not
expected to be reaped immediately.
Responsibility for output and results have been
placed lower in the organisation. A quarterly bank-
wide event follows up on realised changes.
Inadequate data and IT
systems
There is a risk that data and IT systems are
not able to adequately keep up with market and
supervisory developments, or that (customer) data
are not reliable or poorly accessible. This could
cause agility and innovative strength to lag behind,
and prevent strategic priorities from being realised.
Improvement of the data and IT systems is an
important part of the Strategic Plan. We have taken
an important step with a strategic programme to set
up a robust data processing infrastructure for our
reporting processes.
Insufficient understanding
of the risk profile and
its translation into risk
indicators and limits within
the organisation
There is a risk that the bank, or parts thereof, is
insufficiently able to keep its business operations
within the desired risk profile. This may be caused
by an insufficiently comprehensible translation of
the overarching qualitative RAS into separate risk
indicator limits and insufficient understanding of its
coherence and impact on business activities.
We are in the process of rephrasing the overall RAS
in order to better translate and relate it to individual
risk appetite statements. We clarify the impact of
business decisions on risk indicator limits, exchange
insights between business and risk teams and put in
extra resources to help the business bringing the risk
profile (back) within the limits.

All risks that may have a material impact on the risk
profile and the strategic goals of the bank are included
in de Volksbank’s risk taxonomy. We have clustered
the main types of risk within the risk taxonomy, i.e.
strategic risks, financial risks and operational risks.
When the results of the Strategic Risk Assessment
(SRA) lead to a new material risk, this risk will be
included in the taxonomy. For example, in 2022
we included outsourcing risk as a sub-risk type10
under operational risk. The main types of risk are
discussed in more detail in the remainder of the Risk
Management section of this Integrated Annual Report.
De Volksbank has a comprehensive framework in place
to measure and report risks. For all types of risk
included in our risk taxonomy, we determine the risk
appetite in conjunction with the bank’s general risk
appetite and strategic objectives. The results are laid
down in the Risk Appetite Statements (RAS). We specify
the risk appetite in greater detail by setting up specific

risk indicators and attaching risk thresholds to them.
When risks manifest themselves at a decentral level
within de Volksbank, risk indicators are also measured
and monitored at that level, allowing us to manage any
such risks more effectively and quickly. 
We follow up on the developments of the risks and the
levels of the risk indicators in particular. Each quarter
the second line produces a risk report that comprises
all risks of the risk taxonomy. This report contains
the actual level of the risk indicators and a general
description of the exposure to illustrate the risk profile
per risk type. It summarises the actual profile by
measuring it against the formulated risk appetite. This
overall score (green, yellow, orange, red) is part of the
risk report, as is a forecast for the expected risk score
in the next quarter.
For each risk indicator, we have set an intervention
ladder defining ranges to allow for follow-up action.
These ranges are determined on the basis of results
from internal stress tests, economic capital and the

BUSINESS RISK
• De Volksbank aims to generate stable and
adequate returns for its shareholder(s) to
ensure the viability and sustainability of its
business model.
• Business risk improved, mainly driven by a higher net
interest income due to higher interest rates. The relatively
high cost level remains a point of attention.
REPUTATIONAL RISK
• As de Volksbank thrives on customer trust
and confidence, there is no appetite for
reputational risk exposure. Internal indicators
for reputation sensitive risk types and (internal
and external) signals of events, incidents
or complaints that may harm the bank's
reputation and/or image are assessed - as part
of regular business operations - and followed
up in a pro-active and adequate manner in
order to mitigate the risks involved.
• The introduction of a fixed fee for a basic banking package
was a significant development in 2022 in relation to
reputation management, but neither this event, nor any
other events, caused unexpected or material reputational
damage to de Volksbank or its brands.
SUSTAINABILITY RISK
• De Volksbank wants to make a positive
contribution to a sustainable and just society
with our core activities – mortgages, savings,
payments and investments. ESG events that
may lead to financial or reputational damage
are assessed to mitigate these risks. Therefore,
we have a low appetite for sustainability risk.
• The envisioned annual growth of climate neutrality was
reached. However, it remains essential that the average
energy label of the residential mortgage portfolio improves
in order to match our ambitions. Further integration of
sustainability risk in business processes, governance and
risk management is necessary to comply with (upcoming)
regulation and guidelines.

CREDIT RISK
• De Volksbank is primarily a retail bank that
provides loans to private individuals, self-
employed persons and small businesses in
the Netherlands. In addition, de Volksbank
finances activities related to the sustainable
energy sector such as wind and solar energy
production. As it is our responsibility to help
our customers become and remain financially
resilient, we will only engage in low-risk lending
activities that result in a high and stable
number of financially resilient customers. We
ensure that our strategic focus does not result
in undesired concentration risks.
• Our credit portfolio performs within risk appetite and
we expect most risk parameters to stay amply within
risk appetite limits in 2023.  Nevertheless, more
negative macroeconomic circumstances could lead to some
deterioration of individual credit risk appetite parameters.  
We do not expect economic developments to lead us to
exceed our overall credit risk appetite. 
MARKET RISK
• De Volksbank has a low appetite for market
risk, which implies that trading book exposure
to potentially adverse movements in market
variables should be limited.
• Trading book exposures remained limited. No breaches on
total portfolio occurred.
INTEREST RATE RISK IN THE BANKING BOOK
• De Volksbank aims to protect and stabilise its
net interest income of its activities, economic
value and capital from the potentially adverse
impact of movements in interest rates and
credit spreads.
• IRRBB is coloured yellow with the outlook to become green
as we expect to be fully compliant with the regulatory
requirements in early 2023. The main IRRBB models were
updated and finalised during 2022.
LIQUIDITY RISK
• De Volksbank aims to maintain an adequate
liquidity and funding position, taking into
account the different types of liquidity risk, and
ensuring this has a low appetite for Liquidity
Risk.
• De Volksbank’s current and forecasted liquidity position is
adequate, the liquidity position continues to be strongly
affected by persisting excess liquidity.
Operational (non-financial) risks

OPERATIONAL RISK
• De Volksbank appetite for operational risk
is to accept a low level of losses resulting
from operational events, negative impact form

• Operational risk remains out of appetite and multiple
improvement plans in the area of i.a. data management,
reporting and outsourcing are being executed. These
improvement plans, of which we expect the first impact in
2023, are monitored by the Risk Management Function.

COMPLIANCE RISK
• De Volksbank has no tolerance for violations of
company standards and values and laws and

• Compliance Risk is coloured orange and is expected to
remain so in 2023. Improvement plans are ongoing to bring
compliance risk within our risk appetite.
The progress of these improvement plans are monitored by
the Compliance Function. For more information, see Section
4.5 Operational (non-financial) risks - Compliance risk.
MODEL RISK
• De Volksbank strives to reduce model risk
by having models in place which represent
the actual risks in products and portfolios,
which comply with rules and regulations. The
remaining model risk is mitigated by allocating
capital reserves to model risk and optimising
the quality of model development and use,
while simultaneously weighing the resources
required to improve this quality. De Volksbank
only accepts a limited number of models that
have not been validated or for which the
validation period has expired.
• Model risk is coloured orange. Although there are some early
signs that point towards improvement of the risk profile, no
significant and structural improvements have been observed
so far. Given the long throughput time to make new or
updated models, and have them validated, this may take
time to materialise.
Capital adequacy

Relative

CAPITAL ADEQUACY
• De Volksbank targets a solid and well-
diversified capital position that supports its
strategy and suits its risk profile. De Volksbank
aims to operate well above the minimum
regulatory capital ratios and safeguard its retail
customers and suppliers from bail-in in case of
resolution.
• The current capital position is adequate and within risk
appetite. Any (regulatory) uncertainties are monitored closely
to ensure the capital position remains stable and resilient.
STRESS TESTING
In addition to monitoring our risk indicator-based risk
appetite, we use stress tests to gain insight into the
sensitivity to changes in the underlying causes and
the interrelationship of risks. Several times a year,
we calculate an extreme yet plausible macroeconomic
scenario to determine its effects on aspects such as
our capital and liquidity position. We also perform
climate stress tests to gain insight into the impact
of climate change. Different types of stress tests will
reveal any potential vulnerabilities.
For the use of stress tests in relation to credit risk,
market risk, liquidity risk and capitalisation, refer to

INTRODUCTION
De Volksbank determines three strategic risks, i.e.
business, sustainability and reputational risk.
We have established these strategic risk categories
because they are different in nature. All these risks
have a material impact on the viability of our strategy.
They threaten the bank’s ability to add long-term
value if we fail to adequately identify, and respond
to, internal and external changes and events. An
exception to this is reputational risk which interacts
with other risk types, as it always materialises
through events caused by other risk types. In order
to appropriately manage this dynamic interaction,
reputational risk is classified and managed as a
separate risk type.
In general, we established indicators for all types
of risk, ensuring that the development of risks is
continuously monitored and adjustments are made if
necessary.
Below we describe what the different risk categories
entail and what the developments in that area were in
2022.
Type of risk Developments in 2022
BUSINESS RISK
• Business risk is defined as the risk
that de Volksbank’s profitability may not
be sufficient to guarantee the viability
and sustainability of the bank’s earnings
model. We define the viability of the
earnings model as the extent to which the
bank is capable of generating acceptable
revenues in the next twelve months. The
sustainability of the earnings model is
defined as the extent to which the bank is
capable of generating acceptable revenues
over a three-year horizon. Also part of this
risk type is the bank's ability to adapt to
changed circumstances and transform itself.
• Increasing interest rates supported the bank's net interest income growth
especially after the ECB raised the short-term interest rate. The cost/
income ratio decreased in 2022 but is in the orange 'stress' zone based
on the Risk Appetite Statement-indicator. Excess liquidity is still relatively
high. De Volksbank set an Operational Plan for the 2023-2026 period.
The plan sets mission-driven objectives for growth and improvement. It
also provides a path with actions leading towards the required financial
performance level. For more information on ongoing and future actions
See Section 1.2 Our Strategy.
• The introduction of the basic banking package is a step towards growth in
fee income.
• De Volksbank continuously monitors its environment, assesses relevant
developments and determines how to respond to them. To improve
our adaptability to the environment, we made a start towards an agile
way of working which is part of our Strategic Plan 2021-2025. Our risk
management framework monitored whether the risk assessments on the
organisational transformations were carried out in accordance with the
prescribed methodology. Change portfolio management is important to
mitigate organisational risks. We also continued to refine improvements
made in previous years, such as reporting on the identified risks and
risk-response effectiveness.

Type of risk Developments in 2022
REPUTATIONAL RISK
• Reputational risk is the risk that de
Volksbank becomes subject to negative
public opinion due to internal or external
events, which may negatively impact the
ability of de Volksbank to attract and retain
(the support of) customers, employees,
investors or supervisory and regulatory
authorities. Reputational risks may be
related to our own conduct in events that
have public attention, but also to policy
decisions, our day-to-day actions and issues
regarding products or the behaviour of
individual employees.
• The two main pillars of our strategy, strengthening the relationship
with our customers and having a positive and measurable impact on
society, were and will continue to be key in maintaining the good
reputation of de Volksbank and its brands. While many activities of de
Volksbank and its brands continue to support de Volksbank's reputation,
other developments such as the introduction of a monthly rate for
basic banking services have affected the relationship with some of our
customers. This is reflected in the developments of our Net Promotor
Score and Customer Relation Score, which did not rise on average in
2022.
• Last year, de Volksbank was not subject of any (media) events
causing lasting reputational harm. The majority of media exposure
on de Volksbank and its brands has been positive and the impact
of any negative media attention was limited. Nevertheless, the speed
and impact of digital and social media continue to make consistent
monitoring and adequate responses to reputational risks necessary. De
Volksbank actively monitors current and upcoming internal and external
events that may result in reputational damage for the bank and its
brands. To further support these efforts, we implement a more advanced
tooling to monitor our reputation in 2022.
SUSTAINABILITY RISK
• Sustainability risk is the risk of financial
and/or reputational damage as a result
of environmental, social and governance
developments.
• The developments concerning sustainability risk are elaborated in Section
4.9 Sustainability risk

In 2022, the less positive 
macroeconomic forecasts, in 
particular those for the House 
Price Index (HPI), caused 
a rise in the provision for 
credit losses for residential 
­ mortgages. Furthermore,­
de Volksbank opted to keep

risk of, among other things,

customers’ ability to repay 
their loan(s). Of the total 
impairment charge in 2022 of  
€ 52 million, € 23 million 
related to a small number of 
corporate loans. The actual 
incurred losses of residential 
mortgages and SME loans 
remained at a very low 
level, evidencing the high 
underlying credit quality.

Within de Volksbank, we define credit risk as ‘the risk
that the bank suffers a financial loss or a material
decrease in solvency, due to the fact that a borrower
or counterparty does not meet the financial or other
contractual obligations to the bank, or due to a
significant deterioration of the creditworthiness of the
specific borrower or counterparty’.
4.3.1 Risk profile
To manage its credit risk, de Volksbank clusters its
loans in portfolios. We have a high concentration of
residential mortgage loans in the Netherlands. Other
loan portfolios on our balance sheet are much smaller
in size. We have developed a policy framework to
actively monitor, and thus prevent, any undesirable
concentration risks within our portfolio clusters.
We use specific criteria to allocate customers and loans
to a particular portfolio. One criterion is the type
of customer: a natural person, an SME customer, a
government authority or a financial institution.
We also make a distinction between secured loans,
such as mortgage loans, and unsecured loans, such
as revolving credits, credit facilities on current accounts
and personal loans.
We also distinguish between the various degrees of
security, i.e. a government guarantee, or a guarantee
issued by a fund, such as the National Mortgage
Guarantee (NHG). In our risk policies, we also set
exposure limits to a single counterparty, in order to
avoid excessive losses if the counterparty in question
can no longer meet its obligations. These limits are
regularly reassessed.
To ensure effective monitoring and the timely
implementation of mitigating actions, de Volksbank
draws up reports in line with the portfolio clusters.
The paragraphs in this section successively describe
in more detail how we manage and control
the various loan portfolios, how we apply our
provisioning methodology for each portfolio and how
we characterise the underlying risk drivers.
4.3.2 Management and control
As part of credit risk management, we internally assess
and monitor the credit standing of our customers
and counterparties. In this process we estimate the
probability of our customers being unable to meet
their contractual payment obligations arising from the
loan agreement, as such inability could result in a
potential financial loss for the bank.

At portfolio level, we also steer the risk by defining
the desired credit quality of new loans and the status
of the healthy loans versus the loans in arrears, and
by monitoring the outflow. For a visual representation
of de Volksbank’s credit risk management process, see

REPORTING
De Volksbank has a comprehensive credit risk
monitoring framework allowing it to monitor, analyse
and manage the credit risk at risk appetite level.
The responsibility for credit risk reporting lies with
first line and second line risk management. The first
line monitors portfolio developments to keep the risk
for which it is accountable within the risk appetite.
The second line develops credit risk reports which
provide comprehensive insight into the level of credit
risk and gives a timely warning in case the quality of
the portfolio deteriorates in terms of credit risk. The
first and second lines hold monthly meetings in which
they discuss portfolio developments as well as various
credit risk aspects, including insights gained from the
credit risk reports.
The credit risk reports are periodically submitted to
the Credit Committee, the Executive Committee and
the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Supervisory
Board.
LOAN PORTFOLIOS
Residential mortgages
When providing a new mortgage loan, we apply
internal standards, which are in line with the applicable
legal frameworks, such as a customer’s income and the
collateral value. We also use the acceptance scorecard
to predict whether customers are able to comply
with their long-term obligations. For more information
on risk-mitigation measures, see Section 4.3.5 Risk
mitigation.
We have examined whether we should take additional
measures in response to rising energy costs. We
exercise care in providing tailor-made solutions to
rising energy costs to ensure that customers have
responsible financing now and in the future.
Interest-only mortgages
In 2022, de Volksbank also paid special attention
to the interest-only mortgage sub-portfolio through
the programme entitled 'Customers want to continue
living carefree in their home’. As part of this
programme, we contact all customers with interest-
only mortgages to assess their financial situation at
maturity. 
We continuously monitor interest-only mortgage
customers’ credit risk profile in order to identify
customers who fall into a higher risk category in
a timely manner and contact them proactively. In
conversations with customers, we try to ascertain
whether it is likely that the mortgage, on the basis
of their income, can be refinanced at maturity and
whether they have built up enough funds to pay off
all - or part - of their mortgage at the end of the term.
In 2022, in interaction with the European Central
Bank, we explored additional de-risking measures for
interest-only mortgages in the Netherlands. These
measures may result in further scrutiny of future loan
volume development, impairment charges and capital.
Preventive management and arrears management for
retail customers
De Volksbank regards customer trust as the basis for
a long-term relationship. We manage the credit risk
through an active and specific policy for customers
who are in arrears or are expected to fall into arrears
within 12 months. If there is reason to doubt the
ability of a customer to fulfil his or her obligation
to the bank in accordance with the agreed terms,
the Preventive Management department contacts the
customer. After examining the situation, Preventive
Management assesses if a solution needs to be found
for the customer, if offering a consultation with a
financial coach is a possibility, and if such a solution
is within the commercial mandate. If this is not
the case, the customer is transferred to the Arrears
Management department.
Customers experiencing financial difficulties come
under the responsibility of the Arrears Management
department. This pertains to customers with
mortgages as well as to customers with private loans
or current accounts. It is important that customers
are aware of what they can and should expect from
the Arrears Management department. In this regard,
Arrears Management applies eight service promises,
which are set out on de Volksbank's website and
through individual communication to customers.
If the arrears exceed 30 days, or if the risk of financial
instability rises, a customer is assigned to a case
handler. Our starting point is that customers can stay
in their homes and continue to make their (mortgage)
payments. To this end, the Arrears Management
department also arranges home visits by a dedicated

customer visitor to ensure that there are low-barrier
options for customers to engage in a dialogue about
their financial difficulties.
To prevent an accumulation of payment problems, or
in situations in which the loan has to be called in
early, we may have to apply a forbearance measure.
This is a non-commercial concession: an arrangement
with the customer entailing a temporary or permanent
modification of the loan, the terms and conditions of
the loan and/or payment conditions. If customers are
truly unable to meet their obligations, we consult with
them and may agree on a payment or restructuring
measure.
If no solution is found to resolve the financial
difficulties, we support customers in selling their
home. De Volksbank constantly stays in touch with
the customer, to preserve a good relationship. We do
not engage debt collection agencies and only engage a
bailiff if we fail to reach a mutual long-term solution,
even though the customer has the necessary financial
resources, because using external parties' services
drives up the costs for the customer, worsening his or
her financial problems.
At year-end 2022, there are few customers -
who fell into acute financial distress due to the
Covid-19 outbreak - left in the portfolio of the
Arrears Management department, and the number
of customers requiring assistance has returned to pre-
Covid-19 levels.
The deteriorating macroeconomic conditions due
to i.e. rising inflation has led to an increased
number of customers being transferred to the
Arrears Management department as from early 2022.
However, most of these customers were able to
recover on their own. The number of customers
requiring the assistance of case handlers has,
therefore, not increased.
The solutions applied by de Volksbank are still
adequate to help customers solve their financial
problems. In 2023, de Volksbank will continue to
keep a close eye on market developments with
regard to customers who need assistance, and
will continuously monitor whether the (forbearance)
measures remain appropriate when confronted with
changing circumstances.
Consumer loans
Our consumer loan portfolio consists of personal
loans, revolving credit facilities and overdraft facilities,
i.e. credit limits on current accounts.
We reintroduced personal loans in the second half of
2021 for SNS customers as a pilot project. The pilot
was evaluated in mid-2022 and upon meeting the
criteria, the product was subsequently added to our
product portfolio for SNS customers. The portfolio of
personal loans grew steadily over the past year.
We also revised the revolving credit facility in line
with the EBA Guidelines on Loan Origination and
Monitoring (GLOM). As a result, most customers are no
longer able to make any withdrawals. In the first half of
2023, the remaining customers will no longer be able
to make withdrawals.
In 2021, there were various rulings on the
interpretations and use of variable interest clauses in
revolving credits for consumers loans and mortgage
products at other Dutch Banks. De Volksbank
compensates customers with a revolving consumer
credit and customers on their overdraft facilities in
accordance to the Kifid ruling. For more information,
see note 16 Provisions in the Financial statements.
Although our customers are beginning to feel the
effects of the high inflation on their cost of living, so
far, this has not affected the number of defaults in our
consumer loan portfolio.
SME loans
We focus on the small-sized and micro-sized business
market segment in the Netherlands. These businesses
have a maximum turnover of € 5 million. Our SME
loan portfolio consists of two basic products, i.e. (I)
mortgage loans to purchase or refinance commercial
real estate with a maximum notional amount of
€ 2 million and a maximum maturity of 20 years,
and (II) working capital loans of up to € 50,000 for a
maximum of 5 years.
Our maximum Loan to Value is 80% and for cases with
a high sustainable profile (energy efficiency rating in
band A or higher) 90%.
Preventive management and arrears management for
SME customers
As soon as SME customers fall into arrears or inform
us that they anticipate payment problems, we act
on the basis of the key principles of continuity of
the customer's enterprise and the recovery potential.
We record our SME customers’ payment behaviour,
combine this with data of the customer (e.g. products,
collateral) and use this information in risk models to
monitor whether our customers can meet their long-
term obligations. We may have to apply a forbearance
measure. The models calculate the probability of
default, i.e. the failure to make contractually agreed
payments, such as interest and any repayments, and
the resulting loss expected for the bank. As from 2018,
we use the IFRS 9 ECL model outcomes to prioritise
customers who require assistance in recovering from
arrears or default. Together with the customer, we
explore the options to make the business financially
resilient again, focusing on a healthy liquidity and
profitability position. When a customer has recovered
and a stable situation has been achieved, Arrears
Management's supervision ceases, and the customer
is transferred back to regular management. If recovery
proves impossible, we can support the customer in
selling the collateral, in which case we aim to limit the
loss for the customer as well as for the bank.
Other corporate and government loans
This portfolio is made up almost entirely of the
two sub-portfolios of ASN Bank: sustainable loans
and private loans. In addition, through our Financial

Markets portfolio we provide various loans to
other financial institutions and central and regional
governments. Below, we describe what the two sub-
portfolios entail.
ASN Bank sustainable loans
ASN Bank’s sustainable loans are mainly loans
provided to organisations in the renewable energy
sector. We mitigate concentration risk by thorough
knowledge of the sector, geographical distribution
of investments and diversification by type of energy
production (wind, solar, thermal storage and biomass)
and underlying suppliers (solar panels and wind
turbines). A major part of the sustainable loans
involves government-guaranteed electricity prices and
purchase contracts.
Rates are under pressure and returns are low in the
sustainable loans market. In addition to our internal
return targets on the sustainable loan portfolio, we
also consider social relevance, such as CO2 reduction,
in our decisions on the relevant loan. The bank only
funds a project if it meets the targets set.
Private placement loans
Private placement loans are mostly ASN Bank
loans provided to housing associations, healthcare
institutions and companies owned by or affiliated with
the government. Such organisations align well with the
social objectives of ASN Bank and de Volksbank.
Most of these loans are secured by a government
guarantee, or a guarantee issued by the Social Housing
Guarantee Fund (WSW) or the Guarantee Fund for the
Health Care Sector (WfZ). Due to these guarantees, this
portfolio has an extremely low risk profile. Because
this is a non-selling portfolio, scheduled repayments
result in a year-on-year decline of the portfolio.
Preventive management and arrears management ASN
Bank loan portfolios
As soon as ASN Bank customers fall into arrears
or state that they anticipate payment problems, we
take action based on the key principles of continuity
of the enterprise of the customer and the potential
for recovery. We may have to apply a forbearance
measure. Together with the customer, we explore the
options for making the business financially resilient
again, focusing on a healthy liquidity and profitability
position. When a customer has recovered and a stable
situation has been achieved, Arrears Management
supervision ceases and the customer is transferred
back to regular management. If recovery proves
impossible, we may support the customer in selling the
collateral. In this case, we aim to limit the loss for the
customer as well as for the bank.
Investments
Investments predominantly consist of a bond portfolio
used for liquidity management. To be included in
this portfolio, counterparties have to meet stringent
requirements and have investment grade ratings.
Loans and advances to banks
The loans provided to banks or other credit institutions
in the Financial Markets portfolio are classified as
Loans and advances to banks, including posted
collateral.
STRESS TESTING AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSES
As part of its Risk Management Framework de
Volksbank evaluates its capital and liquidity position
under severe stress conditions. The level of credit
risk has a significant impact on stress test results. In
addition, we regularly measure the sensitivity of the
loan portfolios, and the level of the loan loss provisions
against fluctuations of macroeconomic parameters.
Just like other banks, we are sensitive to these
fluctuations. However, thanks to its strong capital
and liquidity position, de Volksbank has proven to be
capable of withstanding the extreme scenarios applied
in these stress tests. For further details, see Section
4.8.2 Capital management - Management and control.
4.3.3 Provisioning methodology Audited
LOAN LOSS PROVISIONS (IFRS 9)
Based on IFRS 9 Expected Credit Loss (ECL) models,
we estimate the risk of our customers running into
financial difficulties on a monthly basis. Details of how
loan loss provisions are determined are set out in this
section.
Under IFRS 9, de Volksbank forms a provision for
expected credit losses for every customer with a loan
or credit facility. This provision also includes expected
losses on loan commitments and financial guarantee
contracts, known as ‘off-balance sheet commitments’.
ECL MODELS AND LOAN PORTFOLIOS
At de Volksbank, we distinguish the following specific
loan portfolios for which we determine loan loss
provisions :
• residential mortgages;
• consumer loans;
• SME loans;
• sustainable and private placement loans of ASN
Bank (the ASN Bank portfolio, as part of the other
commercial and government loans);
• Financial Markets portfolio (included in other
commercial and government loans, investments and
loans and advances to banks).
De Volksbank uses a specific IFRS 9 model for every
portfolio to establish customers’ creditworthiness and
the Expected Credit Loss (ECL). The ECL models are
Point-In-Time (PIT) and forward-looking, which means
that, at every reporting date, they calculate the ECL
for every loan in the portfolio based on internal
predictions of the present economic situation in three
scenarios (base, up and down), with every scenario
being assigned a probability of occurrence.

IFRS 9 includes three stages reflecting how the credit
risk of a loan may develop over time compared with
the date of origination. The stages are decisive for the
calculation method and the amount of the provision to
be made. The IFRS 9 stage allocation process within de
Volksbank is presented in the diagram above.
Stage 1: 12-month ECL (category I)
Stage 1 includes customers with loans that have
shown no significant increase in credit risk since the
origination date. For these customers, we form a
provision for expected losses (ECL) in the next 12
months.
Stage 2: lifetime ECL not credit impaired
(categories II-V)
We form a provision for stage 2 customers based
on losses expected until maturity (lifetime ECL). A
customer is included in stage 2 if at least one of the
following conditions applies:
II. A customer has been in arrears for more than 30 days
A customer is in arrears if the interest payment and/or
redemption amount is past due one day after the
agreed payment date (monthly payment arrangement)
and exceeds a threshold value. When a customer is
past due for more than 30 days, the loan is transferred
to stage 2.
As far as the day count is concerned, we check a
total amount in arrears against absolute and relative
thresholds. In the case of a private obligor, the
counting starts when the total amount in arrears
exceeds € 100 and is higher than 1% of total
outstanding exposure for days past due. For business
obligors and financial institutions, the absolute
threshold is set at € 500, while the relative threshold
is kept at 1%, the same level as for private obligors.
III. The credit rating is subject to significant deterioration
(SICR trigger), ensuing from the ECL models
For each individual portfolio, the ECL models
determine when a customer’s credit rating is subject to
significant deterioration (Significant Increase in Credit
Risk, SICR). For the residential mortgage portfolio this
deterioration is assessed by comparing the current
lifetime Probability of Default (PD) with the lifetime PD
we assigned to the customer on the origination date. If
the difference between the two exceeds a pre-defined
threshold, the lifetime PD is considered to have
significantly deteriorated and the customer is allocated
to stage 2. If the customer’s lifetime PD subsequently
improves, the customer may be transferred back to
stage 1, keeping the threshold in mind. The threshold
is based on statistical methods.
For the other loan portfolios, a significant deterioration
in credit risk is assessed as follows:
• In the SICR model for SME loans, customers
are classified into PD buckets according to their
individual credit rating calculated on the loan
origination date. Depending on the PD bucket,
the current credit rating may show a capped
deterioration compared with the loan origination
date.
• Consumer loans are assigned a rating. If this rating
exceeds a pre-determined limit, the credit facility is
allocated to stage 2.
• For customers in the ASN Bank portfolio, we assess
whether the current PD shows that pre-determined
relative and absolute limits are exceeded compared
with the PD on the loan origination date. If this is
the case, the loan will be allocated to stage 2.
• For the exposures in the Financial Markets portfolio,
the current external credit rating and PD are used to
assess whether there is a significant deterioration
relative to the external credit rating and the PD
upon initial recognition of the bond or loan. If

INFORMATION
117de Volksbank N.V. Integrated Annual Report 2022
pre-determined relative and absolute limits are
exceeded, the bond or loan will be allocated to
stage 2.
IV. A forbearance measure is applied to one of the
customer’s contracts
Customers who have been subjected to a forbearance
measure and who do not meet the prudential non-
performing criteria are allocated to stage 2. This
category consists of:
1) customers who are subject to a forbearance
measure but who have not yet been classified as non-
performing, and
2) customers who were previously part of
the prudential non-performing forborne category
(category VII) and were reclassified to the prudential
performing forborne category after a probation period
of at least one year. Following a minimum probation
period of two years, a customer is allocated to stage 1.
V. Potentially very high-risk customers according to the
AFM methodology adopted by de Volksbank
De Volksbank pays special attention to retail customers
with full or partial interest-only mortgage loans.
Mortgage loans with a high expected Loan-to-Value
(LtV) and nearing maturity, retirement of the borrower
or the end of tax deductibility of interest payments (i.e.
time-to-event) are allocated to stage 2 because of the
higher potential risk of these loans. The stage can be
revised when, after talking to the customer, there is
more certainty about income data and the capacity to
refinance the loan in the future. In 2022, de Volksbank
expanded the scope and included customers with an
interest only mortgage with an LtV between 50% and
80% and a time-to-event of < 5 years.
Stage 3: lifetime ECL credit impaired (VI-VII)
If a customer is credit impaired, the loans provided are
considered non-performing and allocated to stage 3.
The provision is formed based on losses expected until
maturity (lifetime ECL). A loan is credit impaired in the
following situations:
VI. Non-performing loans of customers without
a forbearance measure
De Volksbank applies a specific definition of default to
every portfolio for which loan loss provisions have to
be determined. A default is considered to occur if at
least one of the following conditions is met:
• the obligor is past due more than 90 days on any
material credit obligation and/or;
• the obligor is considered unlikely-to-pay (UtP).
Examples of these UtP triggers are the following:
• suspension of payment
• bankruptcy
• fraud
• sale of the collateral by the Arrears Management
department
• sale of the collateral with a residual debt
• potentially very high-risk interest-only mortgages
with affordability under pressure
Customers only recover from the default status once
the arrears have been repaid in full or the UtP triggers
have lapsed, and a three-month probation period has
expired.
VII. Non-performing loans of customers subject to a
forbearance measure
In addition to loans in default, loans to customers -
who are subject to a forbearance measure and who
meet the prudential non-performing criteria -
are allocated to stage 3. This is the case for forborne
loans that were transferred to stage 2 after a one-
year probation period in stage 3 and receive a new
forbearance measure and/or later fall into arrears of
30 days.
RISK MANAGEMENT OF ECL MODELS
We calculate the various risks in the aforementioned
portfolios at customer level on a monthly basis by
means of our credit risk models. Monitoring the
development of the customer and the portfolio is
essential if we make proper estimates of the loss
expected. We have provisions in place for expected
losses and we maintain capital for unexpected credit
losses.
MODEL TECHNIQUES
To arrive at the ECL models, we use various techniques
for the individual portfolios.
Residential mortgages, SME loans and ASN Bank
loan portfolio
We use the survival model technique for the residential
mortgage loans, SME loans and the ASN Bank loan
portfolio. This is a method to calculate the month-
on-month Probability of Default (PD), Probability of
Cure and Probability of Foreclosure. These models
determine the creditworthiness of the customer over
two periods: 1) a 12-month period; i.e. we calculate the
probability of the customer defaulting on payments
in the next 12 months (also known as the ‘12-month
PD’), and 2) the remaining term of the loan; i.e. we
calculate the probability of the customer defaulting on
payments at any time during the remaining term of the
loan (also known as the ‘lifetime PD’).
The total expected credit loss (ECL) is determined by
multiplying customers' PDs with the amount of loss
expected in case of default (LGD) and the customer's
exposure at default (EAD).
Enhanced provisioning model
We made a change in estimate in 2022 when
determining the provisions for residential mortgages.
The most important change was the implementation
of the updated IFRS 9 Expected Credit Loss (ECL)
model for residential mortgages, which contains model
refinements i.a. with regard to interest-only mortgages.
This had an increasing impact of € 29 million on the
provision for credit risk as at 31 December 2022.
Consumer loans
We apply an expert-based model to determine
stage allocation and provisioning for consumer loans,
consisting of personal loans, revolving credit and

overdraft facilities (credit limits on current accounts).
The model calculates an individual PD at customer
level and ranks consumer contracts from low to
high risk based on risk parameters. These risk
parameters include the registered arrears, use of the
limit available and the date of origination. Contracts
are then allocated to stages based on their credit
ranking (rating). We use historical observations (default
rates) to set an average PD for each stage, and the
LGD is a result of the expert judgement based on
historical data. We determine the ECL by multiplying
the stage-dependent PD and product-specific LGD by
the amount of the credit facility.
Financial Markets portfolio
For ECL of the Financial Markets portfolio, we use a
model in which the PD is derived from spreads on
Credit Default Swap (CDS) curves. Specific CDS curves
have been selected for various portfolio components.
The ECL is the sum of the cumulative PDs multiplied by
the cumulative discounted cashflows multiplied by the
LGD factor. ECL stage migration for underperforming
financial instruments is based on numerical as well
as qualitative triggers, such as significant increases in
PD as well as three notch credit rating downgrades.
These credit ratings originate from well-known rating
agencies such as S&P and Moody’s.
FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
We use three scenarios in our provisions calculations,
in which we also make forward-looking information
available. The three scenarios describe the expected
macroeconomic forecast (baseline scenario) as well as
a downside and upside development. An independent
team of macroeconomic experts estimates forward-
looking trends based on various macroeconomic
parameters for each scenario. In making these
estimates, these experts also look at trends and
forecasts of external parties, such as Eurostat,
Statistics Netherlands (CBS) and the Netherlands
Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (CPB). All three
scenarios describe a realistic development of the
macroeconomy.
Weights are also assigned to the scenarios based on
the probability of the scenario becoming a reality.
The development of macroeconomic parameters is
predicted four years ahead. After that period, the ECL
models extrapolate the values of the macroeconomic
variables to a long-term average. A 12-month ECL and
a lifetime ECL are calculated for each of the three
scenarios and for each customer, on a monthly basis.
The scenario weights are used to calculate a weighted
average 12-month ECL and a lifetime ECL.
For residential mortgages, we use the following
macroeconomic parameters: the relative change in
house prices i.e. the house price index, and the
unemployment rate. For SME loans, we use the
unemployment rate and the number of bankruptcies.
In the model for consumer loans, we only use the
unemployment rate as a macroeconomic parameter.
All macroeconomic parameters of the ECL models for
residential mortgages, consumer loans and SME loans
are related to the developments in the Netherlands.
In the Financial Markets and ASN Bank ECL model,
the macroeconomic impact is incorporated in the CDS
curves used.
The Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) approves
the scenarios and the corresponding weights. The
scenarios that are used to determine the provisions
are also used to draw up our Operational Plan. The
scenarios and the weights are assessed on a quarterly
basis and adjusted where necessary.
The parameters used in the three scenarios are
presented in Section 4.3.4 Figures, ratios and trends.
WRITE-OFF
When writing off a loan, we make a distinction
between the waiver of amounts payable and the write-
off of a residual debt. The following is a description of
these terms:
1. Waiver of amounts payable: a (part of the) loan
is written off if the waiver of amounts payable
leads to the customer's recovery. The consequence
of this is that the customer can meet his or her
payment obligations again. Waivers of amounts
payable are debited to the credit provision;
2. Write-off of residual debt: there may be a residual
debt as a result of a recovery process. This residual
debt is fully provisioned for. Any collateral is
realised during a period of 6 months after the
execution process. After this period, any remaining
debt is written off.
MANAGEMENT OVERLAY
To reflect the extraordinary level of economic
uncertainty related to the impact of the Covid-19
pandemic and the subsequent lockdowns, de
Volksbank introduced a management overlay in the
provision for its residential mortgages and SME loans
with effect from mid-2020. All Covid-19 restrictions in
the Netherlands were lifted at the end of March 2022.
As we did not see a Covid-19 related deterioration
of the credit quality of our portfolio as shown
by back testing, we released the Covid-19-related
management overlay. However, we have identified
other uncertainties, such as inflation, and new
elements have therefore been introduced in the
general management overlay. For more information,
please refer to Section 4.3.4 Figures, ratios and trends.
There is no management overlay in place for consumer
loans, nor for other corporate and government
loans. De Volksbank reviews the elements of the
management overlay at least every quarter.
CREDIT RISK IN CAPITAL ADEQUACY
To determine capital requirements for credit risk
of residential mortgages, de Volksbank uses the
Advanced Internal Ratings-based (AIRB) approach. The
AIRB approach measures credit risk by using internal
models for the calculation of PD and LGD.
For the other exposures, risk-weighted assets are
determined according to the Standardised Approach
(SA).

Definition of Default (DoD)
As from 31 December 2021, we have implemented
a uniform definition of default (DoD) for all credit
exposures, which is aligned to the Regulatory Capital
CRR Article 178. A default is considered to occur if at
least one of the following conditions is met:
• the obligor is past due more than 90 days on any
material credit obligation and/or;
• the obligor is considered unlikely-to-pay (UtP).

MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN 2022
In 2022, total loans and advances to customers
decreased by € 1.6 billion to € 49.1billion. This was
attributable to negative IFRS fair value adjustments,
which decreased by € 2.9 billion due to the increase in
interest rates. Excluding the fair value adjustments and
amortisation, gross growth amounted to € 1.3 billion,
mainly attributable to the gross growth in residential
mortgages by € 1.1 billion.
In addition, the total outstanding amount of SME loans
rose by € 255 million. Other corporate and government
loans contracted by € 28 million, while consumer loans
remained virtually stable.
The provision for credit losses increased by
€ 48 million to € 168 million, mainly due to a less
positive macroeconomic outlook, most notably lower
house prices, the introduction of a management
overlay that reflects the risk of high inflation for our
residential mortgage customers and a few corporate
loans transferred to stage 3.
For more details on the provision for credit losses, see
the Section Management overlay and the Sections per
portfolio later in this Section Credit risk.
General approach to customer services
The Russia-Ukraine war, accompanied by high food
and energy prices and the continued supply-chain
problems, put pressure on global economies. To keep
emerging risks under control we tightened a number
of acceptance policy rules for residential mortgages.
For example, for customers in certain risk categories
we lowered the maximum Loan-to-Value for interest-
only mortgages from 50% to 40% of the property’s
market value.
The SME loan portfolio was not directly affected by
the Russia-Ukraine war. At this moment, we do not
yet see a reason to tighten the acceptance criteria for
SME loans. We do, however, expect rising inflation to
have some impact in the future and carefully monitor
developments.
In 2020, in response to the Covid-19 crisis, we adjusted
our approach to supporting customers who suffered
from the economic impact of the pandemic. In 2021,
we continued to offer financial support to customers
who had trouble repaying their mortgage or consumer
loan due to Covid-19. By the end of 2022, we recorded
little to no credit deterioration in our loan portfolios as
a result of the pandemic. This was mainly on account
of government support measures for corporates taken
in the past two years and to our timely provision of
customer support.

MANAGEMENT OVERLAY
In mid-2020, in response to the extraordinary level
of economic uncertainty related to the Covid-19
pandemic and the subsequent lockdowns, de
Volksbank introduced management overlays in its
provisioning for residential mortgages and SME loans,
i.e. a Covid-19-related management overlay and a
general management overlay. At the end of March
2022, all Covid-19 restrictions in the Netherlands
were lifted. As we did not see a Covid-19 related
deterioration of the credit quality of our portfolio
as shown by back testing, we released the Covid-19-
related management overlay.
We also released the general management overlay
which was introduced to absorb a decrease in house
prices based on the one-year backwards House
Price Index (HPI) recorded by Statistics Netherlands
(CBS); decreasing house prices are captured in our
macroeconomic forecasts and as such drove the
overlay down until it evaporated. The year-on-year
growth recorded by CBS fell from 20.4% in December
2021 to 2.7% in December 2022. The release of the
management overlay is offset by higher modelled
provisions on account of the lower expected HPI in the
macroeconomic forecasts.
The Covid-19 pandemic left scars in several supply
chains, resulting in an imbalance between supply
and demand and an increase in inflation. The
Russia-Ukraine war amplified this increase, particularly
because of higher energy prices, affecting almost
every business. Inflation can cause financial strain
for households, especially for customers who recently
originated a loan with a high loan-to-income ratio. To
cover this risk, we introduced a management overlay in
the amount of € 24 million.
To mitigate the risk of falling house prices for interest-
only mortgages in particular, as these loans do
not decline over time, we formed a management
overlay of € 4 million, based on the HPI change
of our macroeconomic forecasts. Additionally, stage
triggers for interest-only mortgages were revised by
extending the scope of potentially high-risk interest-
only mortgages. This estimate change resulted in an
€ 8 million increase in the provision for credit risk
as at 31 December 2022. Together with € 11 million
for model limitations, this makes up the general
management overlay of € 47 million for our residential
mortgage portfolio.
We formed a general management overlay of
€ 4 million for SME customers who may be affected
by inflation, increased gas and energy prices and
the Russia-Ukraine war in combination with bleaker
cashflow forecasts (caused by the less favourable
macroeconomic conditions).
There is no expert overlay in place for consumer loans
nor for other corporate and government loans.
We review the elements of the management overlay at
least every quarter.

MACROECONOMIC SCENARIOS AND SENSITIVITY
The Russia-Ukraine war set the Dutch economy, which
had not yet fully recovered from the Covid-19 crisis,
on a course of slower growth and rising inflation.
Although house prices continued to rise to 13.6%
on average in 2022, they went down on a month-on-
month basis since August. Mortgage rates rose, for
example the Dutch 10-year fixed mortgage rate rose
to 4.1% from 1.1% at year-end 2021.
De Volksbank adjusted its macroeconomic forecasts to
the new reality. The forecasts for the unemployment
rate, bankruptcies, HPI change and the volume of
housing transactions deteriorated in all scenarios
(upward, base and downward) compared to the
fourth quarter of 2021. Scenario weights were kept
unchanged.
Analysis of sensitivity to scenario weights
The sensitivity analyses in the tables below show
de Volksbank's macroeconomic projections for the
next four years. They also show the sensitivity of
provisioning levels to the upward, base and downward

scenario weights, keeping the management overlay
parameters constant. If we look at the different
scenarios as at 31 December 2022 with a 100%
weighting, we see that the provision for residential
mortgages would increase by € 29 million in a
downward scenario, decrease by € 35 million in an
upward scenario and decrease by € 10 million in a
baseline scenario.
The sensitivity to macroeconomic expectations on the
loan loss provisions for SME loans is less significant.
The provision for SME loans would increase by
€ 2 million in a downward scenario, decrease by
€ 2 million in an upward scenario and decrease by
€ 1 million in a baseline scenario, again assuming a
100% weighting of the respective scenarios.
For consumer loans and other corporate and
government loans, the sensitivity to the scenario
weights is limited since the provisions in stage 1 and
2 for consumer loans are relatively low and other
corporate and government loans generally have a low
credit risk profile.

Offsetting
The bank offsets financial assets and liabilities and
reports the net amount on the balance sheet if there
is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised
amounts, and if there is an intention to settle the
items on a net basis, or to settle the asset and the
liability simultaneously. There is an enforceable right
to offset amounts, provided it is not dependent on a
future event and is legally enforceable under normal
circumstances as well as in the case of bankruptcy.
If these conditions are not met, amounts will not be
offset.
Offsetting, netting, collateral and guarantees
The table below shows how exposures were offset,
netted, collateralised and guaranteed as at year-end
2022 and 2021. The table discloses the potential effect
of netting arrangements and collateral agreements
on de Volksbank's financial position. We included
the potential effect of rights of set-off related to de
Volksbank's recognised financial assets and recognised
financial liabilities.
The amounts eligible for offsetting pursuant to the
International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA)
contracts are related to derivatives and amount to
€ 807 million (2021: € 474 million).

Loans and advances to banks
The guarantees for loans and advances to banks
are guarantees issued by regional or central
governments. The collateral is mainly linked to
derivative transactions.
Residential mortgages
As far as residential mortgages are concerned, we
ensure that the inflow of loans meets adequate
standards in respect of customer, income and
collateral. We limit potential losses resulting from
credit risk by setting conditions on collateral, such as
the value of the collateral and possibly the issue of a
National Mortgage Guarantee (NHG).
An NHG mortgage provides both the customer and the
bank with additional security. On 1 January 2022, the
NHG limit was set at € 355,000 and at € 376,300 in case
of investments in energy-saving measures. With effect
from 1 January 2023, these maximum amounts were
raised to € 405,000 and € 429,300 respectively.
Of the residential mortgages, € 11.8 billion (2021:
€ 11.7 billion), i.e. 24%, of the gross carrying amount
of the exposure fell under the NHG guarantee scheme
(see also the table Breakdown of residential mortgages
by LtV bucket in Section 4.3.6 Residential mortgages).
The LtV is the amount of the (remaining) loan
expressed as a percentage of the indexed market value
of the collateral. In 2018, the maximum regulatory LtV
for new mortgage loans was lowered to 100%. A low
LtV is advantageous to both customers and the bank,
as it reduces the likelihood of a residual debt.
Consequently lower LtVs will mean lower risk
surcharges in our mortgage rates at origination. We
bring this to customers’ attention as part of the SNS
Mortgage Term Monitoring Service. If customers’ LtV
has fallen during the term of the mortgage contract,
they may request a risk surcharge reduction. They can
do so by submitting a recent valuation report of the
collateral showing that the collateral value increased
or, alternatively, by making additional repayments thus
reducing the mortgage amount.
Every month, we index collateral values based on
house price developments by using indices, by
municipality and type of collateral, which we purchase
from third parties. For our portfolio management,
we adjust the collateral value both upwards and
downwards. If the value of collateral has dropped, we
do adjust the LtV but we do not impose the higher risk
surcharge on the customer.
The weighted average indexed LtV of the residential
mortgages improved to 51%, from 53% at year-end
2021 (see also the table Breakdown of residential
mortgages by LtV bucket in Section 4.3.6 Residential
mortgages). Rising house prices have led to a shift of
mortgages to lower LtV buckets.
In the event of foreclosure, we instruct an appraiser of
our choosing to (re)value the collateral.
SME loans
The major part of our SME loan portfolio consists
of mortgages. All collateralised assets are located in
the Netherlands, a mature market for commercial real
estate.
We verify the value of collateral in the SME loan
portfolio at least once a year based on current market
data. If market conditions give cause to do so, we will
perform checks more frequently.
The revaluation frequency for property depends on
the amount of its exposure. If the exposure exceeds
€ 3 million or the exposure exceeds € 1 million
and the LtV is above 80%, the property must be
revalued once every three years. If the exposure is
lower, no revaluation is required because in that case
we monitor the development of the value of the
collateralised property based on market information.
A revaluation is also initiated as part of the (arrears)
management process. This is a standard procedure
once the process for a loan that has been declared
to be in default has been started. A revaluation is
also made if, upon a check, the information received
indicates that the value of the real estate has dropped
sharply in comparison with general market prices.

For every new mortgage or material change in a loan, a
valuation report is required for all properties to which
the loan pertains. For new developments, this is a
valuation based on the specifications and underlying
documents such as a building contract.
Other corporate and government loans
The major part of the sustainable loans we provide
are loans with government-guaranteed electricity
prices or power purchase agreements contracts.
Other corporate and government loans also have
government-issued guarantees for, for example,
healthcare institutions or housing associations.
In 2022, the credit loss provision amounted to
€ 23 million, mainly attributable to a few individual
corporate loans that were transferred to stage 3.
One of the lenders has a partial guarantee from the
shareholder regarding the functioning of the financed
installation. This guarantee is taken into account and
mitigates the credit risk and thus the provision.
We do not use credit derivatives as collateral.
COUNTERPARTY RISK ON DERIVATIVE POSITIONS
De Volksbank conducts money and capital market
transactions with various financial institutions. This
also includes derivative transactions to hedge interest
rate and currency risks. Here, the bank runs the risk
that a counterparty to a transaction defaults before
the final settlement of the cashflows associated with
the transaction has taken place.
To reduce this counterparty risk on derivative
transactions, de Volksbank applies the following order
when entering into such transactions:
• Where possible, the bank concludes derivative
transactions with financial institutions using clearing
via a central counterparty (CCP). Exceptions to
this are transactions that are not supported by
a CCP , and very short-term transactions entailing
extremely high central clearing costs. Of our eligible
derivatives, 97.6% is CCP cleared, based on par
value;
• If central clearing is not possible, the bank
subjects derivative transactions with financial
institutions to collateral agreements. These are
International Swaps and Derivatives Association
(ISDA) standardised contracts with a Credit
Support Annex (CSA) agreed in advance with
each counterparty, laying down the collateral
arrangements. In this respect, the bank limits the
credit risk on counterparties by means of the
provision and acquisition of collateral in the form
of cash that covers the value of the derivatives. If
a counterparty defaults, the bank will terminate the
transactions and the collateral in the amount of the
replacement value of the transactions will become
available to the bank based on the CSA collateral
agreement.
To mitigate counterparty risk, de Volksbank concludes
ISDA Master Agreements with these institutions. This
means that, if a counterparty defaults, all derivative
transactions may be terminated and netted within the
netting set defined in the ISDA. In this case, only a net
claim or commitment in respect of the counterparty
remains.
In relation to the aforementioned, we determine
the collateral required on a regular, frequent basis
(in general daily), i.e. the net market value of
the outstanding derivative transactions, which we
subsequently receive (or have to pay) pursuant to the
CSA following a notification (margin call) to or from the
counterparty.
Both counterparty risk mitigating measures reduce the
EAD calculation according to the CRR/CRD IV rules.
In order to mitigate counterparty risk, de Volksbank
also uses central clearing of OTC11 derivative
transactions to shift counterparty risk to the central
counterparty.
A CCP is a legal entity that positions itself between
the counterparties to an OTC contract, thus becoming
the buyer for the OTC seller and the seller for the
OTC buyer12. Given the CCP's daily settlement of the
counterparties’ market value commitments, as well as
the initial and variation margin requirements to be
paid to the CCP by the counterparties, this central
clearing reduces the EAD calculation. These exposures
are recognised under the categories Institutions and
Corporates. Their risk weighting depends on how the
CCP has separated the collateral from the exposures
and collateral of other CCP clients and clearing
members.
Other risk-mitigating measures taken by de Volksbank
include the following:
• Daily checks to determine whether the fair value
development of derivative positions with collateral
arrangements is proportionate to the collateral
received or to be provided;
• Settlement of forward exchange transactions via
the Continuous Linked Settlement system, a global
system that limits settlement risk by means of the
‘payment versus payment’ method and payment
netting;
• Continuous monitoring to assess whether the
assets available still meet the requirements to serve
as collateral;
• Assessment of the fair value of the collateral
received to ensure that it provides adequate cover
for the underlying derivative.
For some ISDA/CSA agreements with the counterparty,
de Volksbank will provide more collateral if de
Volksbank’s credit rating deteriorates.
De Volksbank does not use credit derivatives as a form
of security or as an instrument to hedge credit risk.

between two counterparties not effected via a formal stock
exchange (such as NYSE or Euronext).

4.3.6 Residential mortgages
Developments in the residential mortgage
portfolio in 2022
So far, geopolitical tensions and the deteriorated
macroeconomic environment have had little impact
on the credit quality of the residential mortgage
portfolio. However, the deteriorated macroeconomic
forecasts, in particular those for the House Price
Index (HPI), caused a rise in the provision for credit
losses for residential mortgages. At the same time,
the percentage of residential mortgages in arrears
remained unchanged at 0.7% and the stage 3 exposure
decreased to € 424 million, from € 531 million at year-
end 2021, causing the stage 3 ratio to decline to 0.9%.
De Volksbank’s residential mortgage portfolio,
excluding IFRS value adjustments, grew to € 48.3 billion
(year-end 2021: € 47.2 billion) as new production
exceeded redemptions. As the mortgage rates rose,
homeowners were eager to lock in rates for a longer
period of time, increasing their financial security. In
2022, the share of new mortgages with a fixed interest
rate of 15 years or longer amounted to 60% of our
total mortgage originations (2021: 71%). Impacted by
the sharp increase in mortgage rates as from the
second quarter, there was a shift towards 10-year fixed
mortgage rates and the market for new mortgages
contracted. New mortgage production amounted to
€ 7.4 billion (2021: € 8.1 billion). Our market share of
new residential mortgage production stood at 5.4%,
compared to 5.8% in 2021. Repayments amounted to
€ 6.3 billion, compared to € 7.0 billion in 2021, mainly
due to the decreasing mortgage refinancing volumes.
Interest rate renewals amounted to € 1.9 billion, a
decrease compared to 2021 (€ 2.4 billion), mainly due
to lower regular renewals.
The percentage of customers who take out NHG-
guaranteed loans has declined gradually over the
years. The weighted average indexed Loan-to-Value
(LtV) of the residential mortgages improved to 51%,
from 53% at year-end 2021. To determine the LtV, we
index collateral values every month on the basis of
house price developments. Rising house prices have
led to a shift of mortgages to lower LtV buckets.

Changes in the credit loss provision for
residential mortgages Audited
In 2022, the credit loss provision for residential
mortgages increased from € 73 million to € 98 million.
The total management overlay for residential
mortgages decreased by € 15 million compared to
year-end 2021, which was offset by an increase in
modelled provisions as a result of a less positive
macroeconomic outlook, model improvements and
scope extension for high-risk interest-only mortgages.
The stage 1 provision rose from € 32 million to
€ 38 million, mainly due to new originations. The
stage 2 provision went up from € 24 million to
€ 31 million as a result of model improvements and
scope extensions in stage 2 with high-risk interest-
only mortgage customers. Stage 3 provisions increased
by € 12 million to € 29 million while stage 3
exposure decreased. This almost doubled the stage 3
coverage ratio compared to year-end 2021, mostly as a
result of model improvements; stage 3 accounted for
€ 16 million of the total € 29 million change in models.

Residential mortgages in arrears
The table below depicts the amount of residential
mortgages in arrears. The total amount of loans in
arrears continued to follow a downward trend from
€ 345 million at year-end 2021 to € 315 million.
The percentage of residential mortgages in arrears
remained unchanged at 0.7%. The short-term arrears
(< 90 days) increased while the long-term arrears (> 90
days) decreased.
With the introduction of the new Definition of Default
(DoD) in 2021, the way in which the day count is
defined was changed. The count starts when the total

4.3.7 Consumer loans
Developments in the consumer loan portfolio
in 2022
The consumer loan portfolio comprises three
products: personal loans, revolving credit and
overdraft facilities. The volume of the consumer loan
portfolio remained stable. The increasing inflow of
new personal loans mitigated the portfolio's downward
trend in recent years as a result of the winding down of
the revolving credit portfolio.
In 2022, the credit quality of the consumer loan
portfolio did not change significantly. High inflation did
have an impact on the portfolio. The revised lending
standards take into account the higher cost of living,
especially for families with children. This substantially
decreased the loan capacity for new loans, leading to
slower growth in new personal loans. Thus far, the
high rate of inflation has not led to higher default
numbers in the portfolio.
The default portfolio (loans in stage 3) declined slightly
leading to a write-off amount of € 1 million. In line with
this, the stage 3 ratio declined from 19.2% to 16.7%.

Changes in the provision for credit losses for
consumer loans Audited
The total provision for credit losses for consumer loans
decreased from € 10 million to € 9 million, mainly due
to write-offs. Coverage ratios over the stages remained
relatively stable.
The provision for off-balance sheet items decreased by
€ 1 million to € 4 million. As of 2021, the new DoD
pulls more customers in default based on unlikely-to-
pay triggers, in addition to arrears. When customers
enter default status based on arrears, the credit limit
for their consumer loans is withdrawn, such that they
no longer have access to the undrawn commitments.
This mechanism is not in place for customers entering
default status based on an unlikely-to-pay trigger.
The undrawn portion of consumer credit products is
considered an off-balance sheet commitment. Since
the new DoD pulls more customers with undrawn off-
balance commitments in default, the related provision
for off-balance sheet items in stage 3 increased
significantly in 2021.

4.3.8 SME loans
Developments in the SME loan portfolio in
2022
In 2022, the focus was on the financeability of SME
companies in the Netherlands. We have simplified our
origination process and expanded the services of our
distribution channels. We offer our customers a mix
between personal contact and digital comfort. As a
result, we originated € 321 million in new loans. Our
portfolio grew from € 830 million to € 1,085 million.
We phased out the support that we offered our
customers who were struggling as a result of the
Covid-19 pandemic as the lockdown restrictions were
lifted and the Dutch government discontinued its
support measures. Furthermore, we received fewer
requests from customers regarding this issue. Despite
recent macroeconomic developments, we did not
experience any direct material impact in the form of
customers’ requests or bankruptcies. We are tracking
and monitoring this closely.

Changes in the provision for credit losses for
SME loans Audited
In 2022, the credit loss provision for SME loans
increased marginally from € 23 million to € 24 million.
The stage 1 provision remained unchanged, as the
addition for newly originated loans was compensated
by a release of the management overlay. Stage 2
and 3 exposure decreased thanks to the recovery
of customers who received financial support during
Covid-19. The decrease in stage 2 exposure, however,
was largely compensated by the inflow of customers
in arrears and customers with a significant increase
in credit risk since initial recognition (SICR) mainly
due to the downward revision of macroeconomic
forecasts. All in all, the stage 2 provision increased
as the coverage ratios for customers in arrears and
SICR customers exceeded those for the recovered
performing forborne customers.

4.3.9 Other corporate and government
loans
Developments in the corporate and
government loan portfolio in 2022
Other corporate and government loans consist almost
entirely of the loan portfolio of ASN Bank, 25% of
which consists of private placement loans to local
authorities and loans to housing associations and
hospitals guaranteed by guarantee funds. The other
75% consists of loans in the sustainable sector, such
as solar and wind energy companies. These loans are
predominantly supported by government incentives
(subsidies and price guarantees). This makes the
portfolio very secure, ensuring a low level of credit risk.
Most of the loans in the other corporate and
government portfolio are found in stage 1 (95%), as
was the case at the end of 2021 (93%). During 2022,
a few individual loans were transferred to stage 3,
however there were no loans in arrears (year-end
2021: no exposure in stage 3, no arrears).

negligible amount of provisions for credit losses.
Other private placement loans
Loans and advances to the public sector are mostly

Loans to other financial corporations
The sustainable funds of ASN Bank consist of
exposures to financial institutions that in turn provide
sustainable financing. At year-end 2022, they all were
found in stage 1 with a provision for credit losses of
less than € 1 million.
Loans to non-financial corporations
ASN Bank sustainable loans
ASN Bank sustainable loans are mostly loans provided
to special purpose vehicles (SPV) established to
finance and operate wind farms, solar parks and
other renewable energy projects, including a biomass
power plant. The major part of the sustainable loans
we provide are loans with government-guaranteed
electricity prices or power purchase agreements and
therefore the credit risk on these loans and advances
is moderate to low.
In 2022, the credit loss provision amounted to
€ 23 million, mainly attributable to a few individual
corporate loans that were transferred to stage 3.
One of the lenders has a partial guarantee from the
shareholder regarding the functioning of the financed
installation. This guarantee is taken into account and
mitigates the credit risk and thus the provision.
Other private placement loans
Loans and advances to the public sector are mostly
loans provided to Dutch municipalities and provinces
and government-guaranteed loans to institutions.
A part of these loans have government-issued
guarantees for, for example, healthcare institutions or
housing associations. Thus, the credit risk on these
loans and advances is very low.

Market risk may arise because de Volksbank concludes
contracts and enters into obligations with customers
and professional counterparties. Market risk may
occur in the banking book and the trading portfolio.
4.4.1 Risk profile
Market risk in the banking book mainly comprises
market interest rate risk, i.e. the risk that the bank’s
future interest income deteriorates if market rates
change. This risk is part and parcel of a bank
that provides mortgage and savings products. In
addition, tradable securities in the liquidity portfolio
are sensitive to value decreases as a consequence of
credit spread risk. Other risks that may be qualified
as market risk are very limited for de Volksbank.
With equity holdings in other companies totalling
€ 12 million (2021: € 13 million), the equity (price)
risk is small. Moreover, the banking book does not
contain any exposure to commodities. De Volksbank
has a limited trading portfolio that includes interest
rate, credit spread and foreign currency exposures.
4.4.2 Management and control Audited
INTEREST RATE RISK IN THE BANKING BOOK
Interest rate risk management aims to protect and
generate stable net interest income. We achieve this
goal by optimising the value of our interest cashflows.
In the assessment and management of interest rate
risks we take the following into account:
• anticipated prepayments on mortgage loans;
• anticipated early adjustments of mortgage rates;
• behavioural aspects of demand deposits;
• customer options in the products;
• effects of the current and anticipated interest rate
environment;
• effects of interest rate developments that deviate
from our expectations.
When managing the banking book’s interest rate risk
we focus on the interest income sensitivity to market
rate movements. We measure the short to medium-
term impact of market rate movements by using the
Earnings-at-Risk (EaR) methodology, and the long-term
impact by using the Economic Value of Equity (EVE)
methodology.
Short-term interest rate risk: EaR
To determine the EaR, we measure the change in
income due to deviations from the expected interest
rate development over a horizon of one year. Deviating
interest rate scenarios are calibrated using statistical
analysis, taking into account a floor for the market
interest rate. This means that it is assumed that
market interest rates will not fall below a certain level.
For this floor, we assume a proportional movement
of -1% for the overnight interest rate, up to 0% for
interest rates of 20 years and longer in line with the
EBA guidance.
Long-term interest rate risk: EVE
When applying the EVE methodology, we determine
the economic value of all future incoming and
outgoing cashflows based on current market rates.
Duration of equity and basis point values per tenor are
the key control measures of EVE sensitivity. Duration
of equity is used to express the relative decrease in
the EVE in the event of a parallel interest rate increase

of 1%. The basis point values per tenor represent the
sensitivity in euros to an interest rate shift at specific
points on the yield curve, enabling us to identify
sensitivity to non-parallel shifts in the market yield
curve.
EBA guidelines
De Volksbank is partially non-compliant with the EBA
guidelines on IRRBB. Full compliance is considered
a high priority and progress is regularly monitored
internally and discussed in the relevant committees.
CURRENCY RISK
We mitigate currency risk by hedging most of our
foreign currency exposures through FX swaps, where
currency risk is managed on a day-to-day basis. The
portfolios that contain currency risk are part of the
set of portfolios for which a one-day VaR is calculated.
These portfolios all have approved limits and are
managed as such. We have hedged the remaining
foreign currency risk in the banking book almost
entirely with FX swaps. The equivalent of the total
net foreign currency exposure of the banking book
and trading book combined at the end of 2022 was
€ 11.9 million (2021: € 3.3 million).
in € millions 2022 2021
 
Total net foreign currency exposure (long) 11.9 3.3
Currency exposure as % Total Capital 0.3% 0.1%
During 2022, de Volksbank deposited its excess
liquidity into its account at the ECB at a rate of
-0.50%. At the same time, de Volksbank continuously
investigates opportunities to optimise the return on
its excess liquidity. The aforementioned economic
uncertainty caused volatility in the short-term interest
rates of currencies. The use of short-term currency
swaps to manage excess liquidity resulted in a
more positive return compared with the rate of
the ECB. The volume of currency swaps is strongly
related to the excess liquidity position. Short swap
transactions fall within our risk parameters (VaR,
Stress and Expected Shortfall) set for such activities
by the ALCO. Transactions are only executed with
counterparties approved by de Volksbank’s Risk
department and its Credit Committee. Controls are
carried out continuously and reported on a daily
basis. All transactions related to cash management are
settled through the Continuously Linked Settlements
system.
MARKET RISK IN THE TRADING BOOK
The trading book may contain exposure to interest rate
risk, credit spread risk and currency risk. Credit spread
risk is only permitted by means of bond exposure in
the HTCS (Hold to Collect and Sale) banking book part
of the liquidity portfolio. The bank does not trade in
credit default swaps. Exposure to equities or equity
risk instruments also falls outside the scope of our
policy.
Market risk in the trading portfolio is measured on
a daily basis by using Value at Risk (VaR), Expected
Shortfall (ES) and stress testing indicators, which are
used for internal monitoring and to specify limits. VaR,
ES as well as the stress tests look ahead to the next
day (one-day horizon), applying a confidence interval
for VaR of 99% and for ES of 97.5%. The total VaR limit
for the trading book is set at € 3 million in 2022 (2021:
€ 2 million), reflecting the relatively low risk profile of
these activities in terms of size.
The VaR methodology is based on Monte Carlo
simulations in which the underlying probability
distribution is assumed. In these simulations, the VaR
model takes into account interest rate risk, currency
risk and credit spread risk. The risk appetite for
currency risk is also low. In addition to the Monte Carlo
simulations, currency risk is managed by monitoring FX
limits on a daily basis.

Duration of equity
At year-end 2022, the duration of equity stood at
1.4 (2021: 3.7). Duration was steered downwards in
2022. In general, we opt for a gradual steering of
the interest rate risk position through natural balance
sheet development. In addition, we use interest rate
derivatives, both linear and non-linear instruments.
Earnings-at-Risk
At year-end 2022, the EaR amounted to € 75 million
before tax (2021: € 67 million). The increase was
mainly caused by the higher interest rates in 2022,
resulting in a lower mitigating impact of the interest
rate floor.
Credit spread risk
At year-end 2022, the credit spread risk for Hold to
Collect and Sale (HTCS) and Hold to Collect (HTC)
liquidity portfolios amounted to € 156 million and
€ 127 million respectively (2021: € 148 million and
€ 93 million). The increase in the credit risk spread of
the HTCS portfolio was due to the greater size of this
portfolio. For the HTC portfolio, the decrease is mainly
explained by value decreases compared to last year,
driven by higher interest rates.

The market risk exposure of the trading book
increased to a carrying amount of € 380 million
for assets and € 550 million for liabilities (2021:
€ 58 million and € 57 million respectively). This
increase is a result of completing the ‘FRTB banking to
trading book’ project in September 2022. The objective
of the project was to become compliant with 1) CRR
trading book requirements, 2) EBA Interest Rate Risk
in the Banking Book (IRRBB) guidelines and the 3) CRR
FRTB requirements.
Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analyses illustrate the market interest rate
risk. The table shows the impact of an immediate
parallel shift of the market yield curve of +100 or -100
basis points (bps). We performed these analyses for
three components: market value of equity, net interest
income and IFRS equity. The impact on net interest
income is shown on a one-year horizon. The reported
outcomes are before taxation.

Market value of equity
We derive the market value of equity from the market
value of the assets and liabilities, where possible based
on available market prices. If this is not possible, we
determine the expected market value on the basis of
the net present value of the cash flows. On top of the
interest rates, we also take into account any product-
specific characteristics, for both the cash flows and the
discount rate. The change in the market value of equity
is reflected by the difference in value that arises when
1% higher and lower interest rates are discounted.
A parallel interest rate shift would have a negative
impact of € 91 million (2021: € 157 million positive) on
the market value of equity. The assets mainly consisted
of mortgages, the interest rate sensitivity of which is
mainly hedged by derivatives, primarily by interest rate
swaps. The change compared to 2021 is explained by
a decrease in the mortgage pipeline. The derivatives
to hedge the pipeline are included in the market value
while the pipeline itself, being off-balance, is excluded.
The negative impact shows that an interest rate hike
will trigger a decline in the value of assets - including
derivatives - that is larger than the decrease in the
value of liabilities.
The scenario of an interest rate decrease does have a
positive effect of € 386 million (2021: € 1,633 million)
on the market value of equity. The value of our assets
increases, largely offset by a value increase in liabilities.
As interest rates have risen significantly compared
to last year, the floor on interest rates is no longer
impacting the discount rate, but only the customer
savings rates. This especially affects the value of the
derivatives in a -100 bps scenario compared to last
year, leading to smaller upward sensitivity.
Net interest income
A parallel interest rate shift of +100 bps would have
yielded a positive impact on net interest income of
€ 135 million at year-end 2022 (2021: € 72 million),
predominantly triggered by the rate hike boosting
income from derivatives and the liquidity position.
A parallel interest rate shift of -100 bps would
have had a negative impact of € 136 million (2021:
€ 67 million), primarily driven by the lower interest
received from derivatives. Compared to last year,
a scenario dependent pass-through was applied at
year-end 2022, leading to a higher positive result in
case of a +100 bps shift. Higher interest rates and
consequently the disappearance of the impact of the
interest rate floor led to a more negative result in a
-100 bps scenario.
IFRS Equity
A parallel interest rate shift of +100 bps will have a
direct negative impact on IFRS equity of € -13 million
(2021: € -54 million), whereas a parallel interest rate
shift of -100 bps will have a positive impact on
IFRS equity of € 61 million (2021: € 58 million). The
interest rate sensitivity of IFRS equity is reflected
in the fair value reserve and other interest income.
This is a consequence of changes in the fair value
of the HTCS liquidity portfolio, including related
interest rate derivatives, combined with the fair value
changes of non-linear derivatives not included in
hedge accounting. The lower sensitivity for a +100 bps
rate shift compared to last year is mainly caused by the
non-linear derivatives, which were more sensitive to a
rate increase.

Besides financial risks, de Volksbank is also exposed
to operational (non-financial) risks, caused by both
internal and external factors and developments. For
a description of these developments, see Section 4.1.2
Top risks.
In an ever-changing world and increasing regulatory
requirements, non-financial risks and their impact on
the organisation have become a material factor.
Operational (non-financial) risks stem from inadequate
or failed internal processes and systems (IT), human
failures or errors, incorrect data or the use of
such data, or external events. Such errors manifest
themselves in fraud, damage to property, system
failure, process errors or a failure to comply with
laws and regulations. The ensuing damage may affect
our customers and the bank financially or harm
our reputation. It is, therefore, essential that we
understand – and report - the risks we run and
implement effective control measures in a timely and
adequate manner.
At de Volksbank, we divide the operational (non-
financial) risks into three sub-categories: operational
risk, compliance risk and model risk, as described
below.
4.5.1 Risk management approach
The Executive Committee (ExCo) dedicates a great deal
of attention to managing and controlling operational
(non-financial) risks. A Risk Control Framework is in
place, and events and incidents are closely monitored
for status and solution. An Operational Risk Committee
(ORC) reviews and assesses the status and progress of
the various sub risk types, on a monthly basis. Overall,
the operational risk score is outside the risk appetite
(see 4.1.3 Risk appetite and risk indicators). For each
sub risk type with an individual score below the risk
appetite, dedicated programmes ('Path-to-Green') are
being set up in order to reach an acceptable level of
risk.
4.5.2 Types of risk and areas of focus
As mentioned above, de Volksbank distinguishes
three categories for operational (non-financial) risks:
operational risk, compliance risk and model risk.
Operational risk and compliance risk are subdivided
into other categories, such as: IT systems risk,
outsourcing risk, reporting risk, people risk, conduct
risk and customer integrity risk.
In the section below, we address the most important
developments with regard to all three categories of risk
in 2022.
Operational risk
People risk
People risk is the risk of direct or indirect loss caused
by a lack of adequate quality and quantity of staff.
Developments in 2022
Mainly due to an increasing sickness absence rate
(flu and Covid-19) and labour market shortages, de
Volksbank is facing challenges in fulfilling all functions
and positions. Although the root cause is partly outside
of de Volksbank’s circle of influence, an action plan is
being drawn up.
In 2022, the Covid-19 pandemic effects lingered on
the way of working at de Volksbank. Sickness absence
rates varied between 4.5% and 5.5%. Despite the fact
that a ‘New Way of Working 2.0’ was introduced to
strive for a better balance between working from
home and in the office.
Preparations to start the new way of working
according to the agile principles were completed
in the first quarter of 2022. As a result, some of

the staff became redundant and some new roles,
such as product managers, scrum masters and
agile coaches were introduced. The external/internal
staff ratio is rather high at present, which could
result in knowledge outflow. In combination with
the tight labour market, making it hard to attract
staff in every sector, this remains a concern for de
Volksbank. Due to changed circumstances, including
internal placement of potentially redundant staff, the
restructuring provision has been significantly reduced.
For more information on the restructuring provision,
please refer to Note 16 Provisions to the consolidated
financial statements.
In the second half of 2022, nationwide inflation
became critical. De Volksbank has programmes to
support customers who have trouble paying their
monthly mortgage payments and energy bills. But for
our own staff, too, we have coaches and programmes
in place when the need arises.
Process risk
Process risk is the risk of direct or indirect
loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes,
including the completeness and structure of processes
and process governance.
Developments in 2022
Over 2022, we noticed a decline in timely modifications
of process descriptions and the timely resolution of
audit recommendations. This is partly caused by the
change related to the transition to agile working and
the overall staff shortage. An action plan is in place to
address these issues.
In 2022, further progress was made towards
strengthening the processes that monitor operational
risk control. We also continued to work on
the implementation of the Governance, Risk and
Compliance (GRC) tool, a risk management application
that simplifies the recording of our business
operations data, enabling us to perform more in-depth
analyses of the effectiveness of our risk management
framework. We continued the implementation of
Policy Management and Policy Compliancy procedures
in the GRC tool and we focused specifically on
the operational risk control of the transition to the
agile cooperation model and enhanced procedures to
monitor the effectiveness of operational controls.
De Volksbank strengthened its ability to perform
process scenario analyses to further improve the
quality of the risk framework.
IT systems risk
IT systems risk is the risk of direct or indirect
loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal (IT)
systems.
Developments in 2022
Based on a roadmap called ‘IT within Risk Appetite’,
steps are taken to modernise our IT landscape.
Essential to this are the implementation of continuous
delivery pipelines and migration to the cloud. The
coverage of the IT key controls is also broadened and
this is implemented in and by the teams in the new
organisation. This will be continued in 2023.
De Volksbank continuously monitors cyber threats and
attacks to maintain a secure IT landscape.
With ever-increasing cyber (crime) threats, we
continued to strengthen the bank's resilience and
(cyber) security. We also increased the coverage of the
IT key controls.
We performed several disaster recovery tests, crisis
management team tests and back-up and data
recovery tests. We analysed new relevant IT-related
legislation such as the Digital Operational Resilience
Act (DORA), the implementation of which has started
and will continue in 2023.
Data management risk
Data management risk is the risk of loss for
de Volksbank and its customers arising from
shortcomings in our data, data definitions and data
structures or their use. This involves the entire
life cycle of data from data entry, development,
interpretation, storage and deletion to phase-out. As
of mid-2022, this risk explicitly includes arrangements
with third parties.
Developments in 2022
With respect to data management risk, overall
governance and monitoring of status and execution of
related key controls need to be reinforced. To solve this
situation, an action plan is being drawn up that will be
implemented in 2023.
At de Volksbank, a dedicated Data Management policy,
which focuses on the ownership of the data and
the measurement and monitoring of data quality,
is in place. Each business unit is assisted by data
stewards in setting up and improving the required data
environment. A Data Quality Dashboard is part of this
environment.
Reporting risk
Reporting risk is the risk that the reporting process
does not function or does not function properly,
leading to a lack of reliable and timely reporting.
Developments in 2022
After finalising a dedicated project (entitled
Deltawerken) at the end of 2021 to deliver a robust
reporting infrastructure, de Volksbank took this
infrastructure into further operation in 2022. The
results are satisfactory. As several (regulatory) reports
still need to be transferred to this infrastructure,
remaining deliverables and implementation tasks have
been transferred to the Finance function; the schedule
for this is available and runs until the end of 2025.
A programme to improve the quality of our financial
key controls has almost been completed. The already
available results have been implemented as Financial
Key Controls in the applicable Control Framework.
Their effectiveness will be tested as from the beginning
of 2023. The programme will be continued in 2023 and

will be transferred as ‘business-as-usual’ to the Finance
function in the course of 2023.
At the request of the ECB, we performed an analysis
of our compliance with BCBS 239 (the Principles for
Effective Risk Data Aggregation and Risk Reporting,
PERDARR) requirements. This has resulted in an
improvement plan that will be carried out in 2023.
In 2021, de Volksbank reassessed its capital treatment
policy for exposures to Swiss Cantons and the Swiss
cantonal banks guaranteed by Swiss Cantons. This
resulted in an adjustment of risk-weighted assets as
at 31 December 2021. In August 2022, de Volksbank
received an information request from the ECB, which
includes information on the impact on the capital
ratios for earlier reporting periods. We have submitted
answers to this request and are now awaiting a
response from the ECB. Depending on the ECB’s
findings, a measure may be imposed. For more
information, see Section 4.8.4 Risk-weighted assets
(RWA).
Legal risk
Legal risk is the risk of financial loss or reputational
damage due to legal or regulatory events originating
from lack of awareness, incorrect or altered
interpretation or non-compliance with laws and
regulations that apply to de Volksbank and its entities
in relation to its agreements, liabilities, processes,
products and services.
Developments in 2022
The number of legal claims remained stable. Notes 20
Contingent liabilities and commitments and 21 Legal
proceedings to the consolidated financial statements
include an overview of material legal proceedings
involving de Volksbank.
Events related to mortgage and consumer credit files
are adequately processed. No material new litigation
was started against de Volksbank in 2022.
Change risk
Change risk is defined as the risk of direct or
indirect loss due to inadequate design, execution
or implementation of changes or of deployment
of processes, resources, products or services, as
a result of insufficient execution power or change
competencies.
Developments in 2022
On 1 March 2022, de Volksbank launched a new way
of working according to the Agile principles, through
which we aim to become more agile and customer
oriented. The entire agile transition process will take
two to three years to complete.
Outsourcing risk
Outsourcing risk is the risk of financial loss or
reputational damage due to the performance of an
outsourcing partner or due to inadequate oversight
and control of outsourced activities.
Developments in 2022
One of the pillars of de Volksbank's strategy
2021-2025 ’better for each other - from promise
to !mpact’ is to become a more efficient and flexible
organisation. De Volksbank aims to increase its
efficiency with partnerships and outsourcing and by
using its capital in a more effective way.
In 2022, de Volksbank launched a programme to
improve governance, policies and procedures related
to outsourcing and to further comply with applicable
legislation. The resulting policies and procedures were
finalised and approved in the fourth quarter of 2022
and overall results were shared with the ECB. In line
with this, de Volksbank is in the process of improving
the quality of the existing contracts. In addition
to improved policies and procedures, de Volksbank
is implementing new tools to support procurement
and outsourcing initiatives. Further execution and
implementation of the aforementioned initiatives will
continue during 2023.
The new outsourcing programme causes a situation
in which the business is not yet able to show the
required level of effectiveness and compliance. It is
expected that once the business is accustomed to the
new programme the applicable risk appetite scores will
improve.
Crime risk
Crime risk is the risk of internal or external criminal
actions that may lead to damage to or loss for
customers, employees or de Volksbank.
Developments in 2022
External and internal fraud remained an important
topic in 2022. The number of external payment fraud
cases for de Volksbank remained stable, with helpdesk
fraud being the most common modus operandi. We
continued our efforts to create public awareness. As
the number of people facing financial difficulties as
a result of economic developments increased, the
number of incidents involving aggression and violence
towards our employees showed a gradual increase.
Compliance risk
We define compliance risk as the risk that de
Volksbank fails to comply with laws, or the spirit of any
such laws, and additional regulations, self-regulation
and relevant codes of conduct.
The Compliance Function continuously monitors
compliance with laws, regulations and internal policies.
The taxonomy of compliance risk distinguishes three
sub-risks: conduct risk, customer integrity risk and
business integrity risk. We ensure better identification
and management of compliance risks by means of
tools, such as regulatory technology, dashboarding and
new privacy tooling.
Developments in 2022
Below, we describe the most important compliance
risk-related developments in 2022.

Compliance Function
After the Compliance Function was further
enhanced and strengthened following the Compliance
Improvement Programme in 2021, last year the focus
was both on maintaining and embedding the results
and on further professionalisation.
Customer integrity risk
AML, CFT, Tax integrity and Sanctions
As a gatekeeper, de Volksbank helps detect and
prevent financial crime, taking a holistic approach
to customer integrity in relation to anti-money
laundering, to countering the financing of terrorism
and to compliance with sanctions and tax regulations.
We consider the gatekeeper function to be an integral
part of our business operations. In 2022, de Volksbank
continued to increase investments in this domain.
The Compliance Function continuously monitors de
Volksbank's customer integrity framework.
De Volksbank is determined to take all necessary steps
to fulfil its gatekeeper responsibilities for which we
closely follow updated legislation. Despite additional
investments, de Volksbank experienced delays in
executing the improvement plan which has been
commenced in 2020 and should have addressed the
shortcomings that have been concluded by DNB in
that same year. We have an ongoing dialogue with
DNB on this subject. As a result we decided we
need to further expand and deepen the improvement
programme that started in 2020 enabling us to
remediate and implement a future-proof and robust
customer integrity framework. Consequently, in the
upcoming period de Volksbank makes additional
investments in this domain, both in relation to
personnel and systems. Furthermore, in 2022 DNB
conducted a supervisory review within de Volksbank
on customer integrity. We expect DNB findings in the
first half of 2023.
De Volksbank closely followed the various EU packages
of sanctions, whereupon we severely restricted
transactions with Russia and Belarus, as well as with
the Donetsk, Cherson, Zaporizhzhia and Luhansk areas
in Ukraine. Improving our sanction-related control
measures, such as sanctions screening, is an ongoing
process. This will include remediation of findings
from regulatory testing of our sanction screening
system conducted by DNB during second half of 2022.
Furthermore, we closely followed, and will continue to
follow, new and updated legislation on the subject of
customer integrity.
Products that meet customer needs & expectations
The financial industry has a responsibility to provide
safe and legally compliant products. Emphasising this
responsibility is de Volksbank's ambition to operate
with a ‘human touch’. This is translated in product
governance and oversight policies, enhanced in recent
years. Products are reviewed by norms and standards
that evolve over time, such as the interpretation of
clauses on floating interest rates of consumer credit.
Interest-only mortgages, too, are subject to
progressing standards. This has considerable impact
on the bank and requires a just and fair way to balance
the interests of customers and the bank alike.
In 2022, in consultation with the ECB, we explored
additional de-risking measures for interest-only
mortgages in the Netherlands. These measures may
result in further scrutiny of future loan volume
development, impairment charges and capital. The
exploration of additional de-risking measures involves
several legal and compliance aspects which are taken
care of by the applicable departments.
Compliance gives advice on key decisions and deems
the decision-making process appropriate.
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
De Volksbank continues to enhance compliance with
the GDPR to protect the privacy of our customers
and employees. For example, we continued to develop
Privacy Governance. A team of privacy officers in the
first line, which supports the ongoing implementation
of the GDPR, was trained by the Data Protection
Officer of the Compliance Function. We also made a
start with incorporating the Processing Register into
privacy tooling. This tooling will also facilitate the
continued development of privacy management within
the organisation.
Following the decision by the Court of Justice of
the European Union (CJEU) regarding data transfers,
we are examining and assessing all contracts
with (sub)processors for the risks resulting from
data processing in countries outside the European
Economic Area (EEA). In addition, we are in the process
of concluding new Standard Contractual Clauses
(SCC), where applicable. Further establishing privacy
compliance within the old data warehouse has our full
attention.
Conduct risk
Genuine attention for our employees
Our code of conduct entitled ‘Common Sense, Clear
Conscience’ is principles based and provides our
employees with guidance and insights, for instance on
how to handle a conflict of interest or on inappropriate
behaviour. To assist staff in assessing situations, we
updated our code of conduct with specific available
scenarios.
Business integrity risk
In September 2022, de Volksbank launched its annual
‘Integrity in the Organisation’ survey. The goal of
this measurement is to obtain a deep understanding
of the day-to-day work environment and how the
organisational culture is supporting employees to
act with integrity on a day-to-day basis. This insight
allows us to prevent potential undesired behaviour
and manage behavioural risks. This year’s baseline
measurement consists of a survey, followed up by an
employee integrity feedback session to understand
and provide insight into the outcomes, resulting
in a first overview of the organisational culture in
relation to acting with integrity. The first follow-up
measurement is planned for 2023. This allows de
Volksbank to manage behavioural risks within the

organisation, expose and analyse potential behavioural
risks, and to even better understand how to help
employees act with integrity and in line with our
purpose, strategy and code of conduct.
Model risk
Model risk is defined as the risk that the financial
position of the bank, or the customers' interests,
is negatively impacted by the use of models.
Model risk arises from errors in the development,
implementation, use, or interpretation of models,
leading to inaccurate, incompliant, or misinterpreted
model output.
Developments in 2022
Model improvement and development is an ongoing
process involving many discussions and iterations with
supervisory authorities. For certain models, review and
formal approval by the supervisory authority is still
pending. We paid a great deal of attention to ensuring
compliance with regulations related to regulatory
capital and provisions, especially with respect to
the residential mortgage portfolio. Throughout the
year, we validated the active model versions for
regulatory capital and the IFRS 9 provisioning for our
residential mortgages in accordance with regulatory
requirements. This resulted in two additional model
refinements for regulatory capital in order to
sufficiently mitigate model risk. For more information,
see Section Risk-weighted assets (RWA) in Chapter
Capital management. The most important change was
the implementation of the updated IFRS 9 Expected
Credit Loss (ECL) model for residential mortgages,
which contains model refinements i.a. with regard to
interest-only mortgages. For more information, see
Section 4.3.3 Provisioning methodology in Chapter
Credit risk.
We also validated numerous market risk models,
in accordance with their respective validation
frequencies.
Finally, the policies on model risk were updated to
bring them in line with the organisational changes and
to make them more risk-based. As the resources used
are better aligned with the model risk level, this now
enables us to assess and mitigate model risk more
efficiently. The latter was also a major step in the
transition from a model validation-focussed approach
to a more comprehensive model risk management
approach.

The bank has a strong 
liquidity position to 
continuously meet its 
financial obligations. 
Savings are our main 
source of funding.
In 2022, the liquidity 
position remained sub-
stantially higher than 
de Volksbank’s internal 
targets and regulatory 
requirements. De 
Volksbank aims to 
reduce the impact of 
excess liquidity on the 
bank’s balance sheet.
Liquidity risk is the risk that de Volksbank, under
normal circumstances as well as in times of stress, has
insufficient liquid assets available in the short, medium
or long term to meet its financial obligations without
incurring unacceptable costs or losses. Liquidity risk
also includes the situation in which the balance sheet
structure develops in such a way that de Volksbank
suffers excessive exposure to a disruption of its
funding sources.
Liquidity management supports de Volksbank’s
strategy within our risk appetite.
4.6.1 Risk profile
De Volksbank has a strong liquidity position, enabling
it to meet its financial obligations at all times. We
manage our liquidity position such that it is able to
absorb the consequences of bank-specific and market-
wide stress factors, such as stress in the money and/or
capital markets.
To fund our liquidity needs, we seek to diversify
our funding sources in accordance with our funding
strategy.
4.6.2 Management and control Audited
De Volksbank centrally manages its liquidity position,
cash flows and liquidity risks.
The risk management cycle as defined in Section
4.1 Risk Management Structure that is used to
manage liquidity risk constitutes the Internal Liquidity
Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP). This process
is performed on a continuous basis, to monitor de
Volksbank's liquidity profile and to ensure the timely
awareness of developments that may require action.
The objective of the ILAAP is to ensure appropriate
coverage of all liquidity risk and control elements, and
to evaluate how planned and expected developments
could influence the adequacy of de Volksbank's
liquidity profile. The risk management lifecycle applies
to liquidity risk management in the following way:
1. Identification of liquidity risks: we continuously
aim to identify all potential risks within the scope
of liquidity management. For example, we perform
an independent risk review of all relevant liquidity
management-related proposals.
2. Assessment of liquidity risks: one element of
the ILAAP is that we continuously assess the
adequacy of our liquidity profile and liquidity risk
management. ILAAP provides input for the ECB's
Supervisory Review & Evaluation Process (SREP).
We present the outcome of our assessment in the
annual ILAAP Liquidity Adequacy Statement (LAS)
report. We compare the current and expected
risk profile with the risk limits that we have
established. We not only use our findings to make
adjustments to the actual liquidity profile, risk
appetite, policy or guidelines, but also to improve
the risk management process. Liquidity risk
assessment within the liquidity risk management
lifecycle also entails:
• the annual recalibration of the liquidity
management strategy. We lay down guidelines
for a balance sheet structure with optimum
efficiency from a liquidity risk perspective. In
this process, we take account of the liquidity
management objective, i.e. an adequate
liquidity and funding profile.

• the definition of actions in the capital and
liquidity plan. We do this at least once a year,
giving substance to the anticipated funding and
liquidity needs ensuing from the Operational
Plan. This plan has a multi-year horizon.
To this end, we make forecasts of relevant
risk indicators compared with the internal
thresholds and work out various scenarios.
• the updating of forecasts in the monthly
Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Report (LAAR).
The forecasts are updated every month based
on the most recent insights and reported to the
Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO). The LAAR
includes a LAS based on the current risk profile
versus the risk thresholds and a forward-looking
assessment.
• regular stress testing to provide insight into the
key vulnerabilities and to assess the resilience
of the liquidity position to severe but plausible
adverse (economic) conditions. The results are
included in the LAAR.
• drawing up a recovery plan and contingency
plan for adverse circumstances. This plan
contains possible measures to strengthen the
liquidity position. An annual update of the
recovery plan contributes to de Volksbank's
continuity. For more information, see Section
4.8.2 Management and control.
3. Risk response to liquidity risks: every year, we
determine the Risk Appetite Statement (RAS) for
liquidity risk in conjunction with de Volksbank’s
general risk appetite and strategic objectives.
To monitor liquidity risk, we use specific risk
indicators and determine the level at which we
feel comfortable on the basis of the liquidity risk
appetite.
4. Monitoring liquidity risks: we monitor early
warning indicators defined in the RAS for liquidity
risk on a regular basis in the Treasury Committee.
On top of this, the ALCO monitors the RAS
indicators in the LAAR on a monthly basis.
5. Residual risk: because of (unexpected) balance
sheet or regulatory developments, we may not
be able to identify or fully manage liquidity risks
at all times. By carrying out the liquidity risk
management lifecycle, we aim to identify these
risks and formulate a risk response.
6. Reporting liquidity risk indicators: we prepare
regulatory and internal reports to measure,
monitor and manage de Volksbank’s liquidity
profile on an ongoing basis.
MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS
Liquidity position
In order to be able to instantly absorb unexpected
increases in its liquidity need when necessary, de
Volksbank maintains a liquidity position, including the
central bank reserves. In addition, the liquidity position
comprises a liquidity portfolio with unencumbered
(highly) liquid investments that are eligible as ECB
collateral and are registered in the DNB collateral pool.
The investments included in our liquidity portfolio are
required to meet our sustainability criteria.
Besides the central bank reserves, the liquidity position
mainly consists of government bonds and bonds of de
Volksbank’s own securitisations, known as Residential
Mortgage Backed Securities (RMBS), with underlying
mortgages of de Volksbank. We determine the liquidity
value of bonds in the liquidity position on the basis
of the fair value of the bonds after applying the
percentage haircuts as determined by the ECB.
Liquidity stress testing
We test the robustness of the liquidity position by
means of stress tests. To this end, we have defined
various scenarios, of which the so-called combined
severe stress test has the highest impact. In this
scenario we take the following into account:
• a strong outflow of savings and current account
balances;
• a lack of funding options in money and capital
markets;
• a decline in the fair value of bonds in the liquidity
position;
• additional collateral requirements in the event of a
3-notch downgrade in our credit rating;
• additional collateral requirements caused by margin
requirements on derivatives;
• a possible liquidity outflow in the event that
committed credit lines are drawn.
The objective of de Volksbank’s liquidity management
is to survive this severe stress scenario for a certain
period of time. The impact of this stress scenario
on the liquidity position therefore serves as input to
determine and monitor de Volksbank’s risk capacity
and risk appetite.
We perform the combined severe stress test every
month and review the stress test scenarios every year.
Key liquidity ratios
The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) indicates whether
we have adequate liquid assets to absorb a prescribed
thirty-day stress scenario. The Net Stable Funding
Ratio (NSFR) serves to determine the extent to which
longer-term assets are financed with more stable
forms of funding. Both liquidity standards are subject
to a 100% regulatory minimum.
In addition to the LCR and NSFR, we manage the Loan-
to-Deposit ratio and the degree of asset encumbrance.
Whereas the liquidity position focuses on liquidity that
is instantly available to function as counterbalancing
capacity when necessary, we also manage liquidity
with a short-term horizon through short-term loans
and investments and money market funding. Apart
from this, we monitor the liquidity that can potentially
be generated from our assets. On this basis, we assess
the extent to which we can absorb certain stress and
extreme outflows of funds.

4.6.3 Figures, ratios and trends
In 2022, the liquidity position remained substantially
higher than de Volksbank’s internal targets and
regulatory requirements. De Volksbank aims to reduce
the undesirable impact of excess liquidity on the
bank's balance sheet.

1 For the measurement methodology of this KPI, reference is made to the
paragraph Reconciliation of alternative performance
measures in this Annual Report.
The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Net
Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) remained well above the
regulatory minimum of 100%. As at 31 December
2022, the LCR stood at 233% (year-end 2021: 324%)
and the NSFR at 174% (2021: 176%).
Fundamental changes in the LCR are mainly driven
by net cash flows resulting from loan growth, deposit
changes, capital market funding developments and
the net cash collateral position related to derivative
positions. However, the resulting net cash impact is
not necessarily reflected in actual withdrawable central
bank reserves as part of high-quality liquid assets,
because de Volksbank invests part of its available
liquidity with several counterparties in the money
market. These cash management choices affect the
liquidity in scope of the 30-day LCR window via both
high-quality liquid assets and cash inflows within 30
days.
The Loan-to-Deposit ratio, i.e. the ratio between loans
outstanding and deposits attracted (see also Section
1.4.3 Reconciliation of APMs), increased to 90% at
year-end 2022, from 86% at year-end 2021. This
increase was driven by € 1.2 billion loan growth
accompanied by a € 0.9 billion reduction in deposits.
The latter is mainly explained by the outflow of mono
savings customers following the introduction of a Basic
Banking package as from 1 July 2022 for SNS and
RegioBank customers and as from 1 October 2022 for
ASN Bank customers.

TLTRO-III funding from the ECB and a € 2.2 billion
decrease in the net cash collateral position related
to derivative positions driven by an increase in
the interest rate curve. Although cash inflows were
comparable with cash outflows in 2022, central bank
reserves decreased from € 10.7 billion to € 8.3 billion
as we invested more available liquidity in the money
market. As at 31 December 2022, € 6.3 billion in assets
had been invested for cash management purposes
(year-end 2021: € 4.0 billion), of which € 3.1 billion
was held at Swiss banks (year-end 2021: € 2.1 billion)
and was therefore not included in the central bank
reserves.
The liquidity value of bonds in the DNB collateral pool
at year-end 2022 amounted to € 8.9 billion (2021:
€ 11.9 billion), of which:
• The liquidity value of eligible retained RMBS
declined to € 5.7 billion (year-end 2021:
€ 7.9 billion), mainly due to the call and non-
replacement of the Lowland 4 transaction, partly
offset by a release of encumbrance after the
redemption of the TLTRO-III funding from the ECB;
• The value of other liquid assets in the liquidity
position decreased by € 0.8 billion. This is
predominantly because a higher amount of
sovereign bonds was not registered in the DNB
collateral pool as at year-end 2022 in comparison
with year-end 2021. These sovereign bonds were
ring-fenced for other purposes, such as possible
repo transactions.

IMPORTANCE OF ASSET ENCUMBRANCE
De Volksbank's main sources of funding are savings
deposits and current account balances. In addition,
we attract funding from the capital market through
various funding instruments, as explained in more
detail in Section 4.6.5 Funding strategy. These funding
instruments include secured debt instruments such
as covered bonds and securitisations. We have
encumbered a limited part of our loan portfolio
in these secured transactions. Other sources that
contribute to asset encumbrance are the margining
of derivative exposures to manage interest rate
risk, a savings-based mortgage arrangement with
Athora Netherlands and mandatory minimum reserve
requirements.
TOTAL ENCUMBERED ASSETS
Based on the median of the four quarters, € 9.0 billion
of the assets was encumbered during 2022. At year-
end 2022, € 8.9 billion of the assets was encumbered
(2021: € 9.3 billion), mainly on account of:
• outstanding covered bonds;
• collateral deposited in connection with derivative
transactions;
• a savings-based mortgage arrangement with Athora
Netherlands;
• outstanding securitisations;
• cash reserve requirements;
• repo transactions;
• foreign exchange transactions;
• payment transactions.
The decrease in 2022 was primarily due to the
redemption of the TLTRO-III funding from the ECB.
At year-end 2022, the total amount of liabilities related
to total encumbered assets stood at € 7.1 billion (2021:
€ 7.7 billion).
UNENCUMBERED ASSETS
The unencumbered part of the assets amounted
to € 64.2 billion at year-end 2022 and may partly
be converted into cash, for example through a
securitisation. Securitised mortgages of which the
bank itself holds the bonds are considered to be
unencumbered, except if these bonds are used as
collateral, for instance in a repurchase transaction.
COLLATERAL RECEIVED
At year-end 2022, de Volksbank received a total
amount of € 2.4 billion in collateral (2021: € 93 million),
consisting entirely of cash deposits that serve as
collateral for the positive fair value of outstanding
derivative positions.

4.6.5 Funding strategy
Our funding strategy supports de Volksbank’s overall
strategy.
Retail savings are de Volksbank’s main source of
funding. Through our brands, we attract term deposits,
demand deposits and current account balances from
retail customers. We also attract savings deposits and
current account balances from SME customers. In
2022, customer deposits declined to € 56.6 billion,
from € 57.6 billion at year-end 2021.
The objective of our funding strategy is to optimise
the bank’s liquidity and funding profile and to ensure
access to diversified funding sources to maintain the
bank’s long-term funding position.
Hence, in addition to savings deposits and current
account balances, we also attract funding from
the capital markets. For regulatory and funding
diversification reasons, this funding is attracted
through various funding instruments with different
terms and investor types spread over regions.
In addition to (subordinated) capital market funding
to strengthen the bank's capital and MREL position,
de Volksbank issues capital market funding with
maturities over one year through:
• senior (unsubordinated) unsecured debt;
• (mortgage) securitisations (RMBS);
• covered bonds.
The covered bond programme not only permits the
issue of public covered bonds but also of private
placements.
We issue funding with a term of up to one year in the
money markets via their Euro Commercial Paper (ECP)
and Negotiable European Commercial Paper (NEUCP)
programmes.
The overview below presents the various public
funding programmes, including maximum amounts
and outstanding nominal value available to de
Volksbank at year-end 2022. The overview also
includes other important funding sources.

as at year-end 2022 and 2021. The percentage of our
funding that is made up of savings and other amounts
due to customers decreased to 78% (year-end 2021:

161de Volksbank N.V. Integrated Annual Report 2022
In 2022, de Volksbank successfully executed several
capital market funding transactions to strengthen its
capital and MREL position, i.e.:
• € 0.3 billion in green perpetual Additional Tier 1
capital securities with a first reset date in 2027;
• € 0.5 billion in green senior non-preferred debt with
a 5-year (non-call 4-year) maturity;
• € 0.2 billion in senior preferred debt with a 2-year
maturity.
De Volksbank also successfully issued € 0.2 billion in
covered bonds with maturities of at least 16 years to
manage its balance sheet risk.
As capital market funding redemptions in 2022 were
limited to € 0.6 billion, capital market funding rose
from € 8.2 billion to € 8.8 billion as at year-end 2022.

The diagram above presents an overview of the
maturity calendar of the capital market funding
outstanding with an original maturity of more than
one year. In the diagram we apply the assumption that
this funding will be redeemed at the first call dates.
To strengthen our MREL position, we plan to issue
senior non-preferred debt in 2023. We also plan to
issue covered bonds.
Maturities of assets and liabilities
We can break down the assets and liabilities according
to the remaining contractual term. The net maturing
nominal amounts, i.e. assets minus liabilities per
maturity are an indication of the:
• liquidity risk;
• obligations that may not be met on time from
inflows.
The uppermost table on the next page represents
de Volksbank’s liquidity profile at year-end on the
basis of the remaining contractual maturity. Demand
deposits and current account balances are presented
in the ‘<1 month’ column. In the tables, we maintain
the contractual maturity without taking into account
behavioural aspects such as mortgage prepayments.
We do however, take into account behavioural
aspects in the bank’s asset & liability management.
A shorter term to maturity is used for mortgages
due to anticipated prepayments. A longer term
to maturity is used for demand deposits and
balances in customers’ current accounts as, in normal
circumstances, customers tend to hold on to such
products for longer periods of time.
Loans and advances to banks and amounts due to
banks also include collateral delivered and received
in relation to derivative transactions. This collateral is
allocated to the maturity buckets in accordance with
the maturity classification of the derivative contracts.
The bottom tables on the next pages provide a
breakdown of the liquidity profiles for financial
liabilities and derivatives on the liability side of the
balance sheet at year-end. The tables also show the
related future undiscounted contractual cashflows.

S&P A A-1 Stable
Moody's A2 P-1 Stable
Fitch A- F1 Stable
In 2022, S&P upgraded de Volksbank's long term
senior preferred debt rating from A- (stable outlook)
to A, also with a stable outlook. The short-term rating
was upgraded from A-2 to A-1. Fitch and Moody’s
reaffirmed the credit ratings and outlook for preferred
debt of de Volksbank.
RATING AMBITION
De Volksbank strives for solid long-term stand-alone
ratings that are in line with its business profile,
where possible supported by additional increases as
a result of a strong and improving balance sheet
structure. To achieve this, de Volksbank intends to
further diversify its capital base. Stable development of
the mortgage portfolio and adequate profitability are
prerequisites for solid stand-alone ratings. Although
rating agencies generally regard de Volksbank’s focus
on Dutch mortgages as a concentration risk, its strong
capital position sufficiently compensates for this.
DEVELOPMENTS IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER
On 1 February 2022, S&P published a report in which
it commented on the ratings of several Dutch banks, in
the light of its revised rating criteria. The credit ratings
of de Volksbank were affirmed, although the uplift
from S&P’s Additional Loss Absorbing Capacity (ALAC)
analysis was capped at one notch, where the bank
first received two notches. Conversely, the negative
adjustment of one notch to reflect the pressure on the
bank’s profitability as perceived by S&P was removed.
On 28 July 2022, Moody’s published a report with an
update of de Volksbank’s credit ratings, affirming the
ratings and maintaining the stable outlook. According
to Moody’s, the credit ratings reflect de Volksbank’s
very low risk profile, strong capital base and moderate
profitability, and the application of Moody's Advanced
Loss Given Failure (LGF) analysis, which results in a
low loss-given-failure and one notch of uplift on senior
preferred debt instruments.
On 26 October 2022, S&P upgraded de Volksbank’s
long-term credit rating to A, from A-, and the short-
term credit rating to A-1, from A-2. The outlook
remained stable. The upgrade reflected the changed
view of S&P on the preferred resolution strategy for de
Volksbank, which is ‘sale of business’. Previously they
believed this would imply additional risks to senior
creditors in a resolution scenario versus an open bank
bail-in, which resulted in the cap on the uplift from the
ALAC analysis of one notch. The changed view led to
the removal of this cap and the full recognition of it,
providing two notches of support.
On 15 November 2022, Fitch published a report in
which they affirmed the credit ratings of de Volksbank
and maintained the stable outlook. According to Fitch,
the credit ratings of de Volksbank reflect its simple but
concentrated business model, sound asset quality and
overall moderate risk profile, satisfactory capitalisation
and leverage, and stable funding underpinned by a
granular and stable deposit base.
The S&P , Moody’s and Fitch rating reports are available
on de Volksbank’s website.

The primary objective of capital management is to
ensure that the amount of de Volksbank’s available
capital is sufficient to support our corporate strategy.
Our capital targets are determined on the basis
of the bank’s strategy, risk appetite and exposures
now and in the future. Considering our ambition
of optimising shared value, we take into account
the supervisory authorities' requirements, rating
agencies' expectations and customers' and investors'
interests, while delivering an adequate return for the
shareholder. We also need to meet internal targets
that are consistent with our aim of being a stable bank
with a moderate risk profile.
4.8.1 Capital requirements
REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
With effect from 1 January 2023, de Volksbank is
required to meet a minimum total Overall Capital
Requirement (OCR) of 14.5%, of which at least 9.72%
needs to be composed of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)
capital. This obligation stems from the Supervisory
Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) performed by
the ECB in 2022.
The OCR is defined as the level at which the Maximum
Distributable Amount (MDA) of dividend is curtailed by
regulations. The OCR includes the 8.0% Pillar 1 capital
requirement and the 3.0% Pillar 2 capital requirement
– together forming the Total SREP Capital Requirement
(TSCR) – and the Combined Buffer Requirement (CBR).

The CBR, to be held in the form of CET1 capital,
consists of a capital conservation buffer, a capital
buffer for Other Systemically Important Institutions
(O-SII buffer) and a countercyclical capital buffer. As
at 1 January 2023, the capital conservation buffer
equalled 2.50% and the O-SII buffer for de Volksbank
equalled 1.0%. The countercyclical capital buffer for
exposures to counterparties is currently 0.03%. This
buffer is intended to protect banks against risks arising
from excessive credit growth.

INTERNAL MINIMUM LEVEL
De Volksbank has set its target for the leverage ratio at
a level of at least 4.5% and the CET1 capital ratio target
at a level of at least 19.0% based on the fully phased-
in Basel IV rules. Our leverage ratio target of at least
4.5% is in line with the leverage ratio of comparable
European banks and includes an ample management
buffer to withstand severe stress situations involving
unfavourable conditions that could greatly impact
income, costs and impairments.
On top of the 9.7% SREP requirement and Pillar
2 Guidance, we also have an ample management
buffer to withstand severe stress situations. As for
our minimum risk-weighted target, the management
buffer also factors in uncertainties that are not
relevant to the leverage ratio. This provides flexibility to
absorb potentially higher capital requirements relative
to the current situation and capital planning, resulting
from, for instance, an increase in the countercyclical
capital buffer or the final impact of the fully phased-in
Basel IV rules on risk-weighted assets.
In time, management buffers – and thus the capital
targets – may be revised, for example when the final
impact of Basel IV has become clear. Capital expected
to sustainably exceed our minimum targets is available
for distribution, subject to regulatory approval.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY
Our strategy incorporates the objective of having
a solid capital position at our disposal to support
de Volksbank’s corporate strategy, combined with an
adequate Return on Equity (RoE). As regards the RoE,
de Volksbank applies a (long-term) target of 8.0%. The
basic principle for the capital amount is that the bank
maintains buffers in addition to the minimum amount
of capital required by the supervisory authority, to
guarantee sufficient capitalisation in the event of a
severe yet plausible stress scenario.
Capital is managed from several perspectives, shown
in the figure below.

REGULATORY CAPITAL AND MREL
The minimum amount of capital required by law, i.e.
regulatory capital, is based on risk-weighted capital
ratios (CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, total capital) and
the required non-risk-weighted capital ratio, i.e. the
leverage ratio. As described in Section 4.8.1 Capital
requirements, the minimum risk-weighted capital
ratios are based on the SREP . In addition to these
required capital ratios, de Volksbank calculates and
reports the Minimum Requirements for Own Funds
and Eligible Liabilities (MREL) on both a risk-weighted
and non-risk-weighted basis, as required by law as
from 1 January 2022.
ECONOMIC CAPITAL
De Volksbank also makes its own internal (economic)
estimate of the amount of capital required. This differs
from regulatory capital in two significant respects:
1. Our calculations of economic capital include all
risks from which material losses may ensue within
a one-year horizon according to internal insight.
Thus, we consider more types of risk than in
regulatory capital calculations.
2. Using our own insight, we translate our risk
appetite into internal capital requirements, partly
based on the desired credit rating. For more
information, see Section 4.7 Credit ratings.
We share the economic capital requirements with
the supervisory authority. This is part of the Internal
Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). We also

use them to determine our internal capital targets and
thresholds for specific types of risk, as applied in the
Risk Appetite Statement (RAS).
STRESS TESTING
De Volksbank performs several stress tests every
year to test the robustness of capital adequacy and
examine other financial aspects, such as in the areas
of liquidity and profitability. Stress tests may be
initiated internally or may be requested by supervisory
authorities.
The scenarios to be calculated are drafted based on
a detailed risk identification, which considers both
systemic risks, i.e. financial system-related risks, and
idiosyncratic risks, i.e. de Volksbank-specific risks. In
addition to scenario analyses, which are used to
calculate the impact of, for example, a macroeconomic
scenario on de Volksbank’s capital position, sensitivity
analyses and reverse stress tests are also performed.
The latter start from a pre-determined outcome, such
as a situation in which the bank is unable to meet
its minimum capital requirements, and then looks at
events that could lead to such a situation.
For the scenarios for which the impact is calculated by
means of a stress test, we estimate the development
of unemployment, economic growth, the interest
rate and other factors. In such a stress test, these
macroeconomic variables adversely impact aspects
such as the net interest margin, the creditworthiness
of the outstanding loan portfolio and the fair value of
the interest-bearing investment portfolio.
This subsequently results in a deterioration of the
bank’s capital position. The stress test results are used
not only to analyse the bank’s sensitivity to various
types of stress, but also as input for setting thresholds
as part of the risk appetite and to determine the
management buffers that we use to set the internal
minimum levels of the capital ratios. Finally, they are
used as input for de Volksbank’s recovery plan.
RATING AGENCIES
The bank’s creditworthiness is assessed by credit rating
agencies S&P , Moody’s and Fitch. To determine a credit
rating, they look at aspects such as our capital position.
To ensure that our capital ratios are in line with our
credit rating ambition, we include the corresponding
capital requirements in our capital planning. For more
detailed information about our credit ratings, see
Section 4.7 Credit ratings.
CAPITAL ADEQUACY LIFECYCLE
The risk management lifecycle as defined in Section
4.1 Risk Management Structure applies to capital
management in the following way:
1. Identification of risks within the scope of capital
adequacy: we continuously aim to identify all
potential, material and emerging risks within
the scope of capital adequacy. For example, we
perform an independent risk review of all relevant
proposals related to capital adequacy.
2. Assessment of the risk profile against the risk
thresholds by comparing the risk exposure
with the available capital from own funds
and MREL eligible liabilities: as part of the
ICAAP , we continuously assess the adequacy and
effectiveness of the risk management framework
as far as capital adequacy and its compliance with
internal policies and the risk appetite framework
are concerned. ICAAP provides input for the ECB's
SREP . We present the outcome of the assessment
in the annual ICAAP Capital Adequacy Statement
(CAS) report. The assessment of (expected future)
capital exposure and developments also comprises
the:
• Annual recalibration of the capital management
strategy.
• Definition of actions in the capital and liquidity
plan, which we draw up at least once a year,
giving substance to the anticipated capital
needs ensuing from the Operational Plan
(OP). As the OP has a multi-year horizon, we
make forecasts of relevant risk indicators and
compare these with the internal thresholds. We
work out various scenarios, taking into account
the anticipated effects of future regulations.
• Update of forecasts in the monthly Capital
Adequacy Assessment Report (CAAR). The CAAR
includes a CAS based on the current risk profile
versus the risk thresholds and a forward-looking
assessment.
• Regular stress tests to provide insight into the
key vulnerabilities and to assess the resilience
of the capital position to severe but plausible
adverse (economic) conditions. The results are
used to set the risk appetite thresholds.
3. Risk response to capital adequacy: every year,
we determine the RAS for capital adequacy
in conjunction with the bank’s general risk
appetite and strategic objectives. To monitor
capital adequacy, we use specific risk indicators
and determine the level above which we feel
comfortable based on the risk appetite for capital
adequacy.
4. Monitoring of capital adequacy: the Treasury
Committee monitors early warning indicators
defined in the RAS for capital adequacy on a
regular basis. The Asset and Liability Committee
(ALCO) monitors the annual and forecasted
development of the RAS indicators in the CAAR on
a monthly basis.
5. Residual risk: not all capital risks are identified or
fully managed at all times, because of expected
or unexpected balance sheet or regulatory
developments. By following the capital adequacy
lifecycle, we intend to identify these risks and
formulate a risk response.
6. Reporting of capital adequacy indicators: we
prepare regulatory and internal reports to
measure, monitor and manage the bank’s capital
adequacy on an ongoing basis.
RECOVERY PLAN AND CONTINGENCY PLANNING
The planning for unforeseen events, i.e. contingency
planning, is part of the bank’s recovery plan. Its key
objective is to prepare de Volksbank for a crisis in
a way that enables us to recover independently and
safeguard the bank’s continuity.
Contingency planning encompasses the drafting and
implementation of an action plan that allows us

to take prompt measures as soon as our capital
position deteriorates (as anticipated or unexpectedly),
for example as a result of financial market conditions.
In addition to capital aspects, we also monitor the
situation with respect to possible liquidity problems.
Potential capital or liquidity problems are identified
by frequent monitoring of ‘early warning’ indicators.
Changes in these indicators may be a first sign of
stress.
In addition to early warning indicators, we have
defined recovery indicators that can trigger the
activation of the recovery plan. Applying the recovery
plan-based measures helps us reinforce the ratios and
recover independently. These measures have a wide
scope and relate not only to capital and liquidity,
but also to operations and communications. The
nature and severity of the deteriorating conditions will
determine the appropriate measures, such as raising
capital, lowering the risk-weighted assets and raising
funding.
In addition to a description of the available measures
and conditions to be met before implementation
of any measures, the recovery plan also contains
an analysis of the expected recovery. The analysis
is supported by several (severe) stress scenarios in
which the effectiveness of these measures has been
assessed, the so-called recoverability assessment.
The recovery plan is updated and discussed with the
ECB’s Joint Supervisory Team (JST) every year. The
recovery plan for 2022 included four scenarios, as
requested by the ECB. These scenarios addressed
system-wide macroeconomic and idiosyncratic stress.
From this analysis the recoverability capacity of de
Volksbank proved to be adequate.
4.8.3 Developments in capital
requirements
BASEL IV
In late 2017, the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision (BCBS) presented the agreement on the
completion of the Basel III capital framework, also
known as Basel IV. On 27 October 2021, the EC
published a legislative proposal amending the Capital
Requirements Regulation (CRR) and the CRD in order
to implement the remaining elements of Basel IV in the
EU. De Volksbank closely monitors the developments,
paying particular attention to new rules for residential
mortgages. For more information, see Section 1.1.2
Regulatory environment. We will adjust our capital
planning if necessary.
As at year-end 2022, we estimate that our total risk-
weighted assets (RWA) according to the fully phased-
in Basel IV standard is similar to total RWA under
current regulations. Based on the capital position as
at year-end 2022, we expect the anticipated changes
in internal modelling approaches and the SA for
operational risk under Basel IV to have a limited effect
on the RWA of de Volksbank.

The Basel IV fully loaded CET1 capital ratio declined

by an increase in RWA for exposures to financial
institutions and corporates. This estimate of our CET1
capital ratio under full phase-in of Basel IV13 exceeds
our target of at least 19%, allowing us to both continue
our growth path and pay out dividend.

(partial) National Mortgage Guarantee (NHG) coverage.
This measure applies to banks that use internal risk
models to calculate capital requirements for their
mortgage portfolios, such as de Volksbank. In October
2021, DNB announced that the regulation would enter
into force on 1 January 2022. The measure would
initially expire on 1 December 2022, but on 8 July 2022,
DNB decided to extend the measure until 1 December
2024. However, as at year-end 2022, this measure has
no impact on de Volksbank, given the RWA increase as
a result of the update of de Volksbank‘s AIRB model
and the Article 3 CRR add-on, which is fully related to
RWA for residential mortgages.
COUNTERCYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER IN THE
NETHERLANDS
On 25 May 2022, DNB announced an increase in the
countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) in the Netherlands
from 0% to 1% applicable as from 25 May 2023,
provided that the current risk profile does not change
significantly. On 19 December 2022, DNB reconfirmed
this intended increase. This is estimated to translate
into a 0.9 percentage-point increase for de Volksbank's
CCyB and subsequently a pro forma OCR of 15.4%, of
which at least 10.6% is to be composed of CET1 capital.
The decision to activate a 1% CCyB in the Netherlands
constitutes a first step towards the intended 2% CCyB
target in a standard risk environment. The purpose of
the CCyB is to increase banks’ resilience as cyclical risks
build up, and to release the buffer as soon as these
risks materialise.
PROVISION FOR NON-PERFORMING EXPOSURES
With effect from 26 April 2019, the CRR was amended
to introduce common minimum loss coverage levels,
i.e. a statutory backstop, for newly originated
loans that become non-performing. Non-performing
exposures (NPEs) represent a risk to a bank's balance
sheet as future losses may not be fully covered by
appropriate reserves.
In addition to these CRR requirements, the ECB
published its expectations for the level of provisions
for NPEs originated before 26 April 2019 and classified
as non-performing on or after 1 April 2018. It
also made a recommendation in its SREP decision
in relation to loans that were classified as non-
performing before 1 April 2018.
De Volksbank will deduct any insufficient coverage
for NPEs under the CRR statutory backstop from
its CET1 capital. As at year-end 2022 this did not
result in a CET1 capital deduction. The prudential
provisions for outstanding NPEs according to the
ECB expectation and SREP recommendation resulted
in a CET1 capital deduction of € 19 million at year-
end 2022. The supervisory dialogue concerning the
ECB's expectations and the SREP recommendation may
impact de Volksbank's CET1 capital ratio and leverage
ratio in the next few years.
GONE-CONCERN CAPITAL: MREL
On 10 May 2021 the National Resolution Authority
(NRA) set the MREL requirement for de Volksbank
at 7.87% of the leverage ratio exposure (LRE) as
from 1 January 2022. As a binding intermediate
subordination target, de Volksbank has to meet at
least 6.55% of the LRE with subordinated instruments,
i.e. Tier 1 capital, Tier 2 capital and senior non-
preferred (SNP) notes.
On 24 March 2022, the NRA updated both the risk-
weighted MREL requirements applicable as from 2022
and the MREL requirements to be met as from
1 January 2024. The updated calibration of the MREL-
LRE requirements as from 2024 was inflated due
to the temporary ECB relief measure to exclude
certain central bank reserves from the LRE. Given the
expiration of this temporary measure on 1 April 2022,
the EU's Single Resolution Board (SRB) recalibrated the
final MREL requirements based on the LRE, including
central bank reserves, in 2022 to ensure adjustment
of the final MREL requirements before 1 January
2024. We have not yet received the decision on the
final MREL requirements. Based on the situation as
at 31 December 2020, the SRB has provided pro
forma minimum final MREL requirements amounting
to 7.82% based on the calibration that would have
applied in the absence of the temporary ECB relief
measure.
As from 1 January 2024, the MREL requirement based
on the LRE is to be fully met with subordinated
instruments. The MREL requirement based on RWA
amounts to 20.41%, excluding the combined buffer
requirements (CBR). The non-risk-weighted MREL
requirements are more restrictive for de Volksbank
than the risk-weighted MREL requirements.
De Volksbank’s capital planning is based on meeting
the binding MREL subordination target as from January
2024, taking into account the binding intermediate
MREL subordination target as from 1 January 2022.
Based on its current capital position, de Volksbank
expects to issue SNP notes totalling € 0.5 billion to
€ 1.0 billion up to 2024, on top of the € 1.5 billion SNP
in debt instruments already issued.

To determine total equity for CRD IV purposes, non-
eligible interim profits are deducted from total equity.
After profit appropriation by the General Meeting of
Shareholders (GMS) in April 2022, € 27 million was
added to CET1 capital from the non-eligible (interim)
profits as at year-end 2021 of € 124 million, in addition
to the deduction of € 97 million for the dividend
payment.
The profit not yet eligible as CRD IV equity for
2022, namely € 153 million, concerns the dividend
declaration on the net profit for the first half
(€ 57 million) and the full net profit for the second half
of 2022 (€ 96 million).
To calculate total equity for CRD IV purposes, the
amount of AT1 capital securities of € 298 million was
also deducted.
To determine CET1 capital, total equity for CRD
IV purposes is subjected to several regulatory
adjustments. These regulatory adjustments amounted
to € 156 million negative at year-end 2022 (2021:
€ 180 million negative), consisting mainly of a
deduction of € 57 million related to the IRB shortfall
and a deduction of € 71 million due to the temporary
and voluntary Article 3 CRR deduction.
The IRB shortfall of € 57 million mainly results
from our Advanced Internal Ratings Based (AIRB)
model calculations. De Volksbank avails itself of an
AIRB model entitled Particuliere Hypotheken Interne
Rating Model (PHIRM) to determine the credit risk
in its residential mortgage portfolio. The model is
continuously redeveloped to comply with new rules
and regulations.
To become fully compliant with existing and new
regulations and to address remaining obligations as
well as internal model validation findings, we have
initiated an overarching programme to incorporate the
improvements into PHIRM. As a result, an amount
of conservatism was already added to our AIRB
calculations in the second half of 2022.
The € 71 million capital deduction reported as allowed
under Article 3 of the CRR at year-end 2022 is
mainly related to a pending supervisory examination
of the implementation of a new data warehouse.
Awaiting further formal approval, de Volksbank added
extra conservatism to the CET1 capital amount and
deducted an amount of € 51 million. An additional
amount of € 20 million was deducted as a prudential
backstop following the ECB's guidelines on non-
performing exposures (NPEs).
On balance, during 2022 CRD IV CET1 capital went
down by € 81 million to € 3,101 million.

Risk-weighted assets (RWA)
Pillar 1 sets the minimum capital requirements based
on the RWA for three types of risk: credit risk, market
risk and operational risk.
In addition to using the AIRB model PHIRM to
determine the credit risk in our residential mortgage
portfolio, we use the Standardised Approach (SA)
– rather than internal models – to calculate the
credit risk of other portfolios (including non-residential
mortgages and loans to governments, businesses and
financial institutions), market risk and operational risk.

In 2022, RWA rose by € 1.3 billion to € 15.3 billion.
RWA for the credit risk of the residential mortgage
portfolio, calculated according to the AIRB approach,
grew by € 2,195 million, mainly due to the additional
conservatism in our AIRB calculations applied as from
the second half of 2022. The average risk weighting
of residential mortgages increased from 12.6% at year-
end 2021 to 16.8% at year-end 2022.
In addition, RWA for credit risk calculated according
to the Standardised Approach (SA) increased by
€ 1,181 million, largely related to the increased short-
term exposures to other financial institutions and
exposures to corporates, used to optimise the return
on excess liquidity.
In 2021, de Volksbank reassessed its capital treatment
policy for exposures to Swiss Cantons and the Swiss
cantonal banks guaranteed by Swiss Cantons. As
a result of this reassessment the risk weight of
these assets was adjusted from 0% to 20% as at
31 December 2021. In August 2022, de Volksbank
received a request for further information from the
ECB, including information on the impact on the
capital ratios for previous reporting periods. We have
submitted answers to this request and are now
awaiting a response from the ECB.
Market risk RWA increased to € 236 million (2021:
nil) as a result of the 'FRTB banking to trading book'
project. The increase in RWA is due to the following:
• Redesign of banking and trading books to ensure
consistent treatment of banking and trading books
internally, in the financial statements and prudential
reporting. As part of this process it was concluded
that trading book derivatives that were not included
yet should be added to the market risk RWA
calculation.
• To comply with the EBA IRRBB requirements, an
internal hedge (‘Internal Risk Transfer) has been set
up. By setting up an Internal Risk Transfer (IRT),
interest rate risk and FX risk is transferred from the
banking book to the trading book.
The RWA for operational risk, the Credit Valuation
Adjustment and the revised securitisation framework
increased by € 4 million to € 1.5 billion in total.
The additional RWA amount stemming from a
temporary and voluntary Article 3 CRR add-on
was lowered from € 3.0 billion at year-end 2021
to € 0.7 billion at year-end 2022. This additional
RWA amount is related to the use of our new
data warehouse, which requires supervisory review
before actual use in external RWA calculations.
Awaiting formal approval, de Volksbank added extra
conservatism to the RWA amount. The amount of
conservatism added to our AIRB calculations in the
second half of 2022, which is largely related to
similar risks underlying the Article 3 CRR RWA add-on,
resulted in an additional RWA amount of € 2.4 billion.
This additional RWA amount largely compensates the
Article 3 add-on related to the new data warehouse,
which was reduced accordingly by € 2.3 billion.
Exposure at Default
The Exposure at Default (EAD) from de Volksbank's
total assets grew from € 73.4 billion at year-end 2021
to € 74.2 billion at the end of 2022. The EAD of the
residential mortgage portfolio grew from € 49.7 billion
to € 50.2 billion.
The EAD for market risk increased to € 25 million
(2021: nil) as there was a trading position in debt
instruments as at year-end 2022.

Leverage ratio
The leverage ratio is the ratio between a bank’s
amount of Tier 1 capital and its total risk exposure.
A minimum level for the leverage ratio is to prevent
banks from building up excessive debts. As from June
2021, a leverage ratio requirement of 3% applies to de
Volksbank.
To manage the risk of excessive leverage, leverage
ratio control is part of our continuous capital planning
process as explained in Section 4.8.2 Management and
control. Secured funding affecting the leverage ratio
denominator is only attracted when consistent with
our liquidity management and funding strategy. For
more information, please refer to Section 4.6 Liquidity
risk management and funding strategy.
The table below presents the leverage ratio of
de Volksbank according to the composition of risk
exposure and equity prescribed in the CRR.
The leverage ratio declined to 4.7%, from 5.1%
at year-end 2021, as the € 9.5 billion leverage
ratio denominator growth had a bigger impact than
the € 217 million increase in Tier 1 capital. The
denominator is the risk exposure amount as defined
by the CRR. From September 2020 to 1 April 2022,

the ECB allowed banks to exclude certain central bank
exposures from the denominators of their leverage
ratios as a temporary relief measure. The expiry of this
measure explains the strong growth in the leverage
ratio denominator in the first half of 2022.
The increase in Tier 1 capital was mainly the result of
the issuance of € 0.3 billion in AT1 capital.
The 4.7% leverage ratio is well above the regulatory
requirement of 3.0% and above our target of at least
4.5%.

Total capital and eligible liabilities rose by € 0.3 billion
to € 6.3 billion. Besides the issuance of € 0.3 billion
in AT1 capital, this is also the result of de Volksbank
successfully issuing € 0.5 billion in green senior non-
preferred (SNP) debt with a 5-year (non-call 4-year)
maturity and € 0.2 billion in green senior preferred
debt with a 2-year maturity. This increase was partly
offset by senior unsecured debt in the amount of
€ 593 million becoming non-eligible.
Total LRE rose by € 9.5 billion to € 71.7 billion in 2022,
primarily due to the expiry of the temporary ECB relief
measure to allow banks to exclude certain central bank
exposures from their leverage ratio denominators.
At year-end 2022, the non-risk-weighted MREL ratio
based on the LRE was equal to 8.8% (2021: 9.6%),
including total capital and all other unsecured liabilities
eligible for MREL under the current Bank Recovery and
Resolution Directive (BRRD). Including only total capital
and eligible SNP liabilities, the non-risk-weighted MREL
ratio based on the leverage ratio exposure equalled
7.5%.
The risk-weighted MREL ratio, based on total capital

In line with this policy, de Volksbank decided in its
General Meeting of Shareholders (GMS) in April 2022
to distribute a dividend of € 97 million for 2021,
corresponding to a pay-out ratio of 60%.
Driven by de Volksbank’s annual profit and considering
current economic and geopolitical uncertainty, we
propose to pay out 50% of the bank's net profit15
for the financial year 2022, which corresponds to a
dividend amount of € 90 million.

Our goal is to make a 
positive impact on society 
and the environment. 
But we also consider 
the possible financial 
and reputational impact 
that sustainability can 
have on the bank.

Sustainability risk is one of the strategic risks
of de Volksbank and is incorporated in the risk
taxonomy as a stand-alone risk type with the aim of
developing a holistic approach to the incorporation
of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)
risk drivers into the bank's overall business
strategy, governance, risk management framework,
organisational structure and reporting practices. We
define sustainability risk as the risk of (in)direct
financial or reputational damage to the bank due
to ESG events or inadequate response to public
expectations with respect to ESG events.
Sustainability risk and sub-risk types
Sustainability risk
Environmental
risk
Social
risk
Governance
risk
As shown in the diagram above, we divide
sustainability risk into three sub-risk types and define
them as follows.
Environmental risk
Environmental risk is defined as the risk of (in)direct
financial or reputational damage to the bank due to
acute or chronic physical environmental risk drivers,
or the role in the transition to an environmentally
sustainable economy of the bank itself or of third
parties. Environmental risk encompasses both climate
risk and other environmental risks such as biodiversity
loss and water scarcity. Environmental risk includes
both physical risk and transition risk:
• Physical risks may arise from more frequent and
severe environmental events. These events can be
acute, such as floods, or chronic, such as a sea level
rise;
• Transition risks may arise from the process of
adapting to a more environmentally sustainable
economy, for example climate-related policy
changes, technological changes or investor
and consumer sentiment towards a greener
environment. For example, when our emissions are
relatively high, we might face higher transition risks
due to climate-related policy changes.
The occurrence of physical and transition risks is often
inversely related. As a response to the potential impact
of physical risks rapid, stringent and far-reaching
governmental policy  can be introduced, which can
lead to increased transition risks. Alternatively, physical
risks might increase over time if governmental policies
are lacking.
Social risk
Social risk is the risk of (in)direct financial or
reputational damage to the bank due to violations of
human rights, employee rights, poverty and customer
relationships committed by the bank itself or by third
parties.
Governance risk
Governance risk is the risk of (in)direct financial or
reputational damage to the bank due to inadequate
corporate governance, ethical management and
transparency by the bank itself or by third parties.
Sustainability risk management refers to management
of (outside-in) impacts of ESG risk drivers on the risk
profile of de Volksbank. The activities of de Volksbank
also lead to (inside-out) impacts on the environment

and society. For more information on how de
Volksbank manages inside-out impacts, see both the
Annual Review 2022 and Section 2. Sustainability
Statements of this Integrated Annual Report.
4.9.1 Risk profile
De Volksbank wants to make a positive contribution
to a sustainable, just and future-proof society through
our core activities. As such, de Volksbank aims to
minimise (the financing of) activities that lead to
negative impacts on society or the environment and
limit (the financing of) activities that are vulnerable to
the impact of ESG events. Therefore, we have a low
appetite for Sustainability Risk.
Our business model and strategy are the main factors
that determine our sustainability risk profile. Being a
retail bank with a high concentration of residential
mortgage loans in the Netherlands, we estimate our
risk profile for sustainability risk to be low. Our
exposure to transition risk primarily follows from
the transition to a more sustainable housing sector.
As energy prices have soared due to the war in
Ukraine, some of our customers experience difficulties
in covering their mortgage payments. De Volksbank
actively encourages and facilitates its customers in
reducing energy costs by making their home more
sustainable, which at the same time decreases our
long-term exposure to transition risk. With regard to
physical risk, environmental and climate change will
also impact the housing sector in the Netherlands.
The intensity and frequency of floods will increase
and houses will also increasingly be impacted by
deteriorations in the foundations and the soil. To keep
track of our risk profile, we monitor the likelihood and
impact of these developments closely.

Section L of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.
The table above displays the loans and advances
and debt securities to non-financial corporates by
sector. De Volksbank has exposures in sectors that
highly contribute to climate change, most of which in
the electricity, gas and steam sector. As our project
finance portfolio solely consists of renewable energy
companies within that sector and does not include
any clients in the (fossil) gas sector, we assess our
exposure to transition risk in sectors that highly
contribute to climate change to be low.   
4.9.2 Management and control
Within the Executive Committee, the Chief Risk Officer
(CRO) is responsible for sustainability risk. For each
risk type, a dedicated risk committee, such as the
Credit Committee, is responsible for the management
of that risk, including the impact of ESG risk drivers
on that risk. In addition to this, we have set up
a multidisciplinary risk committee, the Social Impact
Committee (SIC), to promote a better understanding
of, and an increased focus on, our social impact and
sustainability risk control. This committee monitors
the coherence between inside-out and outside-in

impact, the proper integration of sustainability risks
in the overall business strategy, governance and risk
management and reporting framework. The CRO is
the Chair of this risk committee. The impact of ESG
events on macroeconomic variables is considered in
the periodic update of the macroeconomic scenarios,
as this process includes an assessment of impacts
following ESG events.
As sustainability risk is classified as a stand-alone
risk type and is, therefore, managed within our risk
appetite, a risk management policy and a Risk Appetite
Statement (RAS) for sustainability risk are in place. This
RAS encompasses metrics with thresholds to monitor
transition risks and, as from 2022, also physical
risks. The transition risk metrics and thresholds are
aligned with the long-term targets to have a climate
neutral balance sheet and to have a (net) positive
impact on biodiversity in 2030. As far as social risk
is concerned, we monitor gender diversity in the
leadership functions within our organisation. The
monitoring of sustainability risk is integrated in the
quarterly risk report, which informs the management
body about the exposures to all risks.
An important mitigant to our exposure to sustainability
risk are our strict sustainability policies. The
Sustainability Expertise Centre (SEC) is responsible
for management of our sustainability policies,
including investment criteria for ASN Impact Investors
and the Sustainable Project Finance portfolio. For
more information on these policies, see Section 2.

Report.

Description
Impact
Acute physical events can
have many disrupting
effects: widespread
damage to property of
our clients can lead to
high renovation costs and
consequently increased
Credit and Business risks.
Additionally, operational
processes can be
disrupted, and an
inadequate response of
the bank to acute
physical events can have
reputational impact and
can even lead to increased
legal costs.
The chronic impact
of climate change,
which includes rising
sea levels, can cause
certain regions of the
Netherlands to become
unattractive to live or
even uninhabitable. This
impacts the value of retail
collateral. Chronic impact
can also lead to damage
to property and can
lead to high renovation
costs and consequently
increased Credit and
Business risk.
Policy changes stimulating
the transition towards
a sustainable economy
can pose risks for
de Volksbank. Our
mortgage clients might
be faced with financial
distress due to high
adaptation costs, that
can consequently lead
to increased Credit
and Business risk.
Furthermore, complex
ESG regulations directly
applicable to our own
organisation can lead to
increased Business and
Compliance risk.
Increasingly higher expectations
regarding ESG performance
can become a challenge for
de Volksbank to transform
in a timely manner. Not
meeting these expectations or
not behaving according to
(un)written rules can negatively
impact our reputation and
can even lead to increased
legal costs. This can create
difficulties in attracting clients
and investors. If employees of
de Volksbank and/or business
partners and/or counterparties
do not or insufficiently
behave according to written
and/or unwritten rules of
corporate governance and
ethical management, financial or
reputational impacts may follow.

ESG RISK ASSESSMENT
In 2021, de Volksbank conducted an ESG Risk
Assessment for the first time. This thematic
assessment focussed on the impact of ESG risk.
ESG risk drivers, including climate-related and
environmental risk, are risk drivers that may impact
the exposures in the risk types of the risk taxonomy. All
of our portfolio and business activities were in scope of
this enterprise-level assessment.   
In the assessment, the impact of ESG risk drivers,
such as flooding, transitions in the housing market and
regulatory changes, on the other risk types of the risk
taxonomy was assessed in the short (≤1 year), medium
(1-5 years) and long term (≥5 years).
The ESG risk assessment resulted in the analysis as

In 2022, the results of the ESG risk assessment
were reviewed. Based on expert judgement, we
assessed the impact of Sustainability risk as a
material important risk driver for the risk types Credit
risk, Business risk, Operational risk, Reputational
risk and Compliance risk. This assessment was
mainly qualitative and based on our business
model with a focus on residential mortgages in
the Netherlands, internal and external studies and
upcoming regulations. Due to the relatively small size
of the trading portfolio and sustainability strategy of
de Volksbank, climate events are not regarded as a
primary factor in market risk. De Volksbankused the
assessment results to formulate specific actions to
assess the impact of the identified ESG risk drivers. The
ECB economy wide climate stress test of 2021 reveals a
high flood risk in Northern Europe. In order to analyse
how this risk might impact de Volksbank, we assessed
the impact of flooding on our mortgage portfolio.
We assessed the impact of drought, another relevant
climate risk, as well. For this assessment, we combined
external data on floods and drought probabilities
and estimations of renovation costs with our internal
portfolio data, such as location of the collateral.
However, relevant data is not always available or up to
date and quantification methodologies are still under
development.
All in all, we do not have information that sustainability
risk would have a material financial impact on
the financial results of 2022. As ESG risk drivers
continuously evolve, de Volksbank will conduct an
enterprise-level ESG Risk Assessment on an annual
basis. The next assessment planned for the first
quarter of 2023 will further quantify impacts of ESG
risk drivers and is expected to provide more precise
insights into both our exposure and our response to
sustainability risks in the short, medium and long term.
As described in our risk profile, de Volksbank’s
exposure to sustainability risk primarily follows from
our focus on residential mortgages in the Netherlands.
Based on the chance and impact of each ESG risk
driver on the shortlist, we make a prioritisation of
these risk drivers. While some ESG risk drivers are less
relevant to our business model, others are assessed
as material. Although the deterioration of biodiversity
and regulations related to nitrogen emissions are
expected to have a material impact on the agriculture
industry, this will have less impact on the house prices
in the Netherlands. Other ESG risk drivers, such as
the increasing vulnerability of Northern Europe to
flooding, have been assessed as being material for
de Volksbank. The ESG Risk Assessment is also a key
element in our follow-up to supervisory expectations in
relation to sustainability risk as stated in the ECB Guide
on Climate-related and Environmental Risk and in
specific feedback provided by supervisory authorities.
In addition to this, the results are also relevant for
Pillar 3 disclosures.
MITIGATING RISK CONTROLS
If risks stemming from ESG events are assessed
as material, we will evaluate current risk control
mechanisms and may formulate additional risk
responses.
De Volksbank has strict sustainability criteria in place
to make a positive contribution to society. These
sustainability criteria also function as an important
mitigant to our exposure to ESG risk drivers. For
example, de Volksbank has zero exposure in the
fossil fuel sector, an industry particularly vulnerable
to changing policies and market sentiments. Similarly,
our social and diversity policies for our investments
and our own operations prevent the likelihood
of reputational risks related to social issues. We
continuously assess if investments still meet our
sustainability criteria. Infringement of these criteria will
lead to the termination of specific loans or investments
in our investment universe or portfolio. As insights
on ESG issues and regulations related to ESG are
always evolving, our policies are reviewed and updated
periodically.
An important transition risk in our mortgage portfolio
is the risk that our customers are confronted with
higher energy costs and decreasing collateral value
as home energy-efficiency standards are raised.
De Volksbank mitigates this risk by actively facilitating
our customers in their efforts to make their homes
more sustainable through promotion, awareness and
various financial products.
With regard to physical risks, we monitor our exposure
to material physical risks on a portfolio level. Several
risks, such as risks related to the foundation of
houses, are taken into account and acted upon
in the customer acceptance process. De Volksbank
is currently developing a more comprehensive risk
response to physical risks in our mortgage portfolio.    
In 2022, de Volksbank made substantial progress in
incorporating sustainability risk into its Internal Capital
Adequacy Assessment Process framework. We have
taken steps to further quantify sustainability risks and
set appropriate risk appetite thresholds, thus ensuring
that de Volksbank has adequately allocated capital
should sustainability risks materialise.
STRESS TESTING AND SCENARIO ANALYSIS
In previously conducted stress tests, de Volksbank
examined the Network for Greening the Financial

System (NGFS) hot house world scenarios. The
financial consequences of these scenarios for
de Volksbank were investigated by means of impact
and scenario analyses. The impact analyses mainly
related to physical climate risks such as flooding
and extreme drought for the mortgage portfolio.
The scenario analyses mainly focused on the
macroeconomic consequences of physical climate risks
for the entire balance sheet of de Volksbank.
To identify the risks and financial impact related
to transition risks, the mid-year stress test in 2022
focussed on the disorderly NGFS scenarios. This stress
test consisted of two scenario analyses and examined
the impact of certain imposed climate transition
policies on the asset side of the bank’s balance
sheet composition (residential mortgages, SME loans,
ASN Bank sustainable loans and climate bonds) and
consequently on the bank's financial position. The
first scenario of this stress test was based on the
NGFS delayed transition scenario. The NGFS delayed
transition scenario assumes that the annual emissions
do not decrease until 2030. Consequently, strong
climate policies are necessary to limit global warming
to below 2°C. The second scenario was based on the
NGFS divergent net zero scenario, which reaches net
zero around 2050 though with higher costs due to
divergent policies introduced across sectors leading to
a quicker phase-out of oil use.
In 2021, de Volksbank developed a tool to determine
the impact of the NGFS climate policies on its
balance sheet. The tool uses multiple internal and
external variables including internal climate targets per
portfolio, return targets and emissions data. This tool
has made it possible to make a rough estimate of the
required balance sheet development per transitional
climate scenario in the 2022 mid-year stress test. It can
be concluded from this stress test that the planned
capitalisation is adequate to absorb the solvency
impact of both transitional climate scenarios.
ECB 2022 CLIMATE STRESS TEST
From January until June, de Volksbank participated in
the 2022 climate risk stress test exercise coordinated
by the ECB in which 104 financial institutions
participated. The ECB considers this stress test a
learning exercise. Its aims are to identify vulnerabilities
and challenges that banks are facing, as well as
industry best practices.  We were only requested to
submit a qualitative questionnaire, climate risk metrics
and the realisation data over the year 2021. As far as
the credit risk portfolios were concerned, we did not
have to submit any granular projections for the various
climate scenarios.
Our overall scores on the thematic review and
the climate risk stress test were positive compared
to the average peer group's score. These scores
give us more insight into the progress we
made with integrating sustainability risk into the
business strategy, government and risk management
framework. However, we are aware that further
action is needed to fully understand the impact
of sustainability risk to make informed business
decisions. De Volksbank is committed to further
integrating sustainability risk into the risk management
framework and the materiality assessment.

4.10 Management statement
IN-CONTROL STATEMENT
The Executive Board (ExBo) of de Volksbank N.V. is
responsible for the set-up, presence and operation
of the (risk) management and control system. This
system is designed to manage risks, to support de
Volksbank in achieving its strategic, operational and
financial objectives, and to ensure that reporting on
financial and non-financial performance indicators is
reliable and that laws and regulations are complied
with.
De Volksbank applies the ‘three lines of defence’
model with a clear organisational structure and
accompanying accountability structure, as laid down in
governance and risk committees (see also Section 4.1
Risk management structure).
De Volksbank’s risk management is also further refined
in the annual Operational Plan (OP) cycle, which
translates strategic objectives and risk appetite into
key risk indicators and operational objectives for
the years ahead. The main risks associated with
the OP implementation are identified. This cycle is
carried out in all parts of the organisation. The
business units report on their performance and on
any risks that need to be adjusted. The effectiveness
of the key control measures and controls is regularly
examined and tested. De Volksbank has a structured
process of completing internal In-Control Statements
at department level, which are then weighted, tested
and aggregated at board level for de Volksbank as a
whole.
In 2022, the ExBo assessed the strategic, operational,
financial, reporting and compliance risks, as included
in Section 4.1.2 Top risks. In addition, the ExBo
periodically tested the effectiveness of the design and
operation of the risk management and control system,
as included in Section 4.1 Risk management structure.
The ExBo managed a portfolio of projects that
improved the effectiveness of the risk management
and control system. The results were shared with
the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board, and
discussed with the external auditor.
Based on the aforementioned, the ExBo declares that:
• The risk management and control system
functioned properly in 2022;
• The risk management and control system provides
a reasonable degree of certainty that the material
risks to which de Volksbank is exposed are actually
identified and that these risks are adequately
monitored and controlled; and
• There are no known indications to assume that the
internal risk management system will not continue
to function properly in 2023.
It should be noted, however, that the above does
not imply that the internal risk management system
provides absolute assurance that it can prevent, or
has prevented, all inaccuracies, errors, fraud and non-
compliance with laws and regulations at all times.
RELEVANT DEVELOPMENTS
Twice a year, de Volksbank executes a ‘bottom-up’
internal review of all identified exceptions to a proper
functioning of the internal control system. These
exceptions are ultimately reviewed by the Executive
Committee for their overall impact and required
actions. For 2022, this review did not result in any
new topics and the recognised topics are clearly
addressed in the organisation through action plans
and monitoring of status and progress. The main
topics are:
• IT within Risk Appetite
• Customer Integrity and GDPR
• Risk awareness and culture
• Data management and models
These topics are further explained in the relevant
Sections of this report.
CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
The management and control systems for financial
reporting form an integral part of the risk
management and control systems of de Volksbank.
The most important principal bodies and elements to
manage de Volksbank's financial reporting are the:
• Leadership team of Finance, which sets the
framework for the policies and organisation of
financial accounting systems and processes;
• Accounting Manual of de Volksbank, which
describes the principles for financial reporting;
• Departments are responsible for the correct
and complete administration of the products,
execution of maintenance activities and recording of
transaction data, resulting in accurate and truthful
reports;
• System of financial key controls within the
administrative and reporting departments, which
monitor the proper functioning of the management
and control system for financial reporting purposes;
• Assessments, which are partially based on the
results of the key controls, of periodic management
reports and KPI dashboards with an analysis of
financial and non-financial figures by the Leadership
team of Finance;
• ExBo, which approves the findings of the reporting
process and the financial reporting itself, which are
subsequently discussed in the Audit Committee;
• Internal Audit department, which examines the
system's operation;
• External auditor who reports on the system of
financial key controls insofar as this results from his
activities for the audit of the financial statements.
The key issues of this audit are included in
the Independent auditor's report. The findings
are discussed with de Volksbank’s financial and
risk committees, the Audit Committee and the
Supervisory Board.
We declare with a reasonable degree of certainty that
the internal management and control systems for
financial reporting functioned at an adequate level in
2022 and that de Volksbank’s financial reporting does
not contain any material inaccuracies.

These changes are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.
AMENDMENTS TO IAS 12 INCOME TAXES: DEFERRED TAX RELATED TO ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARISING FROM A
SINGLE TRANSACTION
The amendments to IAS 12 are expected to have a limited impact on de Volksbank's balance sheet, which will be
extended slightly.
The presentation of the consolidated balance sheet and certain notes have been changed to provide additional
and more relevant information or (for changes in comparative information) to better align them with the current
period presentation. The impact of these changes is explained in the relevant notes when significant.
Changes in accounting policies, estimates and presentation
Accounting policy change
In 2022 no changes in accounting policies were made.
Change in accounting estimates
Timing of cash flows used in accounting for prepayment penalties related to interest averaging contracts
De Volksbank has refined the timing of cash flows used in accounting for prepayment penalties related to interest
averaging contracts. The timing of these cash flows cannot be fully derived from the contractual terms and
conditions, because some of our mortgage customers will repay their mortgage before the contractual end date of
the mortgage due to moving home, etc. To take into account these behavioural aspects of customers de Volksbank
uses a prepayment model. The refinement of expected cashflows, together with some minor model improvements,
resulted in additional income amounting to € 20 million. The recalibration contributes to a consistent accounting
of prepayment penalties related to interest rate averaging contracts going forward and leads to more relevant
information.
Updated IFRS 9 ECL model for residential mortgages
We made a change in estimate in 2022 when determining the provisions for residential mortgages. The most
important change was the implementation of the update IFRS 9 Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model for residential
mortgages, which contains model refinements i.a. with regard to interest-only mortgages. This had an increasing
impact of € 29 million on the provision for credit risk as at 31 December 2022.
Additionally, stage triggers for interest-only mortgages have been revised, by extending the scope of the potentially
high-risk interest-only mortgages. This had an increasing impact of € 8 million on the provision for credit risk as at
31 December 2022.
Accounting principles for the consolidated financial statements
The accounting principles set out below have been applied consistently to all the periods presented in these
consolidated financial statements. All subsidiaries applied the accounting principles consistently, for the purposes
of these consolidated financial statements.
Functional currency and reporting currency
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in millions of euros (€). The euro is the functional and
reporting currency of de Volksbank. All financial data presented in euros are rounded to the nearest million, unless
stated otherwise. Counts are based on unrounded figures.
Significant accounting policies
The use of judgements, estimates and assumptions in the preparation of the financial
statements
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires de Volksbank to make judgements, estimations
and assumptions based on complex and subjective opinions and best estimates. These estimates have a significant
impact on the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the contingent assets and liabilities at the balance
sheet date, and the reported income and expenses for the financial year. In this regard, management judges
situations on the basis of available information and financial data which could potentially change going forward.
Although the estimates are made to the best of the management’s knowledge, actual results may differ from these
estimates and the use of other propositions or data may lead to materially different results.
Judgements, estimations and assumptions are reviewed on a regular basis. The impact of changes in estimates on
the accounting outcome is recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised or in the period of revision and
future periods if the revision impacts both the reporting period and future periods.

accounting principles of these balance sheet items. The use of judgements, estimates and assumptions in
determining the fair value of financial instruments, for both balance sheet valuations and disclosures, relates
to the items below. For detailed information and disclosure of the accounting judgements, estimates and
assumptions reference is made to the next sections and the notes to the financial statements items.

Basis for consolidation
Subsidiaries, i.e. all companies and other entities, including special purpose entities, which are controlled by de
Volksbank, are consolidated in accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to de Volksbank. They are de-
consolidated from the date control ceases. The financial statements of these subsidiaries, drafted for the purpose
of de Volksbank's financial statements, are fully consolidated and aligned with the accounting principles applied by
de Volksbank. Non-controlling interests are initially stated at their share in the fair value of the net assets on the
acquisition date and subsequently adjusted for the non-controlling share in changes in the subsidiary's equity.
De Volksbank accounts for business combinations when control is obtained by the bank. All items of the
consideration are measured and recognised at fair value at acquisition date. The excess of consideration over
the share of the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs in
connection to the purchase of the business combination are expensed as incurred.
Elimination of group transactions
Intra-group transactions, intra-group balances and unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group
transactions are eliminated in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains on transactions between de Volksbank and its associates are eliminated to the extent of de
Volksbank’s interest in these investments.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no
evidence of impairment.
Foreign currencies
Upon initial recognition, transactions in foreign currencies are converted into euros against the exchange rate at
the transaction date. Monetary balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into euros at
the exchange rate applicable on the reporting date. Exchange rate differences from these transactions and from
converting monetary balance sheet items expressed in foreign currencies are recorded in the income statement
under ‘investment income’ or ‘result on financial instruments’, depending on the balance sheet item to which they
relate.
Government grants
Government grants that are related to income are recognised in the income statement on a systematic basis over
the periods that the related expenses, for which it is intended to compensate, are recognised. In the case of an
income-related government grant, the government grant is deducted from the related expense. For instance, if
the related expense consists of interest due on specific funding, the government grant will be recognised as a
deduction from the related interest expense.
Accounting based on transaction date and settlement date
All purchases and sales of financial instruments, which have been settled in accordance with standard market
practices, are recognised on the transaction date, more specifically, the date on which de Volksbank commits itself
to buy or sell the asset or liability. We use settlement date accounting for 'loans and advances to customers' and
'amounts due to customers'.
Derecognition
A financial asset is derecognised when the rights to receive cashflows from the asset have expired. De Volksbank
also derecognises the assets if it has both transferred the asset, and the transfer qualifies for derecognition. A
transfer only qualifies for derecognition if de Volksbank has either:
• Transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset; or

INFORMATION
193de Volksbank N.V. Integrated Annual Report 2022
• Neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control
of the asset.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expired.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms,
or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a
derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference between the carrying
value of the original financial liability and the consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss.
Offsetting of financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported on the balance sheet if there is a legally
enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts, and there is an intention to settle the items on a net basis,
or to settle the asset and the liability simultaneously. There is an enforceable right to set off, provided it is not
dependent on a future event and is legally enforceable under normal circumstances as well as in bankruptcy. If
these conditions are not met, amounts will not be offset.
Cashflow statement
The cashflow statement is prepared according to the indirect method, and distinguishes between cashflows from
operational, investment and financing activities. Cashflows in foreign currency are converted at the exchange rate
applicable on the transaction date. With regard to cashflow from operations, operating results before taxation
are adjusted for gains and losses that did not result in income and payments in the same financial year and for
movements in provisions and accrued and deferred items.
Investments in subsidiaries and associates are stated under cashflow from investing activities. The cash and cash
equivalents available at the acquisition date are deducted from the purchase price.
In the context of the cashflow statement, cash and cash equivalents are equal to the balance sheet item cash and
cash equivalents.
Acquisitions and disposals
ACCOUNTING POLICIES ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS
De Volksbank accounts for business combinations when control is obtained by the bank. The acquired
business combination’s assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at fair value on acquisition
date and are subsequently accounted for in accordance with de Volksbank's accounting principles, which are
consistent with IFRS-EU. Non-controlling interests are initially stated at their share in the fair value of the
net assets on the acquisition date and subsequently adjusted for the non-controlling share in changes in the
subsidiary’s equity.
The excess of the consideration paid to acquire the business combination over the share of de Volksbank in
the net fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, is recognised as goodwill. Negative
goodwill is recognised directly in the income statement. If the fair values of the assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities, acquired in the business combination, have been determined provisionally, adjustments to these
values, resulting from the emergence of new evidence within 12 months after the acquisition date, are made
against goodwill. Transaction costs in connection to the purchase of the business combination are expensed as
incurred.
In 2022 there were no acquisitions or disposals of businesses.
On 1 September 2021, de Volksbank completed the acquisition of 90% of the shares of the property valuation
platform Fitrex B.V. The total purchase price amounted to € 8 million. In accordance with IFRS 3 Business
Combinations, the transaction resulted in a goodwill of approximately € 6 million. The amount of goodwill is
assessed annually for impairment. Intangibles amounted to € 1 million and are largely attributable to the customer
base for intermediaries, with an amortisation period of 5 years. Goodwill has been assessed for impairment and
resulted in the conclusion that the amount is recoverable and no impairment is required.
In 2021, there were no disposals of businesses.

ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR DERIVATIVES
General
Derivatives are recognised at fair value upon entering into the contract. The fair value of publicly traded
derivatives is based on listed prices.
The fair value of non-publicly traded derivatives depends on the type of instrument and is based on a
discounted cashflow model or an option valuation model. De Volksbank recognises derivatives with a positive
market value as assets and derivatives with a negative market value as liabilities.

IBOR REFORM
Pursuant to the EU Benchmarks Regulation, most reference rates (IBORs) for variable-interest financial instruments
have been replaced by Alternative Reference Rates (ARR).
• As from 3 January 2022, EONIA ceased to be published and was converted in the euro short-term rate (€STR);
• The calculation method for Euribor was modified in 2019, followed by authorisation under the EU Benchmarks
Regulation. Market participants are, therefore, allowed to continue to use Euribor, which is expected to remain
in existence as a benchmark rate for the foreseeable future;
• USD Libor will continue to be published until 30 June 2023, with Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)
adopted in place. As at 31 December 2022, the carrying value for USD Libor Non – derivatives financial assets
amounted to € 44 million, of which € 36 million has a maturity date beyond mid-2023 and will be negotiated
bilaterally with the counterparties involved.
4 Hedging and hedge accounting
ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR HEDGING AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING
De Volksbank uses derivatives as part of its asset and liability management and risk management. Derivatives
are used to hedge interest rate and foreign currency risks in assets and liabilities. The accounting treatment
of the hedged item and the hedging instrument depends on whether the hedge relationship qualifies for
hedge accounting in accordance with the EU carve out version of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement.
Under IFRS, derivatives are measured at fair value in the balance sheet and any change in the fair value
is accounted for in the income statement. In the event that changes in fair value of hedged risks are not
recognised through the income statement, an accounting mismatch occurs, causing volatility in the results.
In these cases, hedge accounting is applied (when possible) to mitigate as much as possible the accounting
mismatch and volatility. The IFRS 9 standard provides users with the option of starting to apply the IFRS 9
hedge accounting rules or to continue to apply the (EU carve out version of) IAS 39 hedge accounting rules. De
Volksbank has decided to continue to apply the EU carve out version of IAS 39 hedge accounting requirements.
De Volksbank designates certain derivatives as a hedge of either:
1. The risk of changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability or firm commitment (fair value hedge);
or
2. The variability of future cashflows that can be attributed to a particular risk associated with a recognised
asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cashflow hedge).
Both at the inception of the hedge accounting and on an ongoing basis, de Volksbank assesses whether the
derivatives used in its hedging transactions have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value
or variability of the cashflows of the hedged item, insofar as they are attributable to the hedged risk, and the
actual results remain within a range of 80% to 125% of the expected outcome. Hedge ineffectiveness and gains
and losses on components of a derivative that are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are
recorded directly in the income statement in the line item Other result on financial instruments. Hedge ratios
follow from the choices made for hedging of interest and currency risks. Ineffectiveness in hedge relationships
might be caused by differences in maturities of the swap and the hedged item; and by the fair value of the
floating leg of the interest rate swap, which is not reflected in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to
the change in interest rate.
De Volksbank discontinues hedge accounting when the hedge relationship ceased to be effective or when the
derivative or hedged item is sold or otherwise terminated.
The changes in fair value for derivatives that hedge economic risks and do not comply with the conditions of
the EU carve out version of IAS 39 for hedge accounting or for which it is not cost-efficient to apply hedge
accounting, are recognised directly in the income statement.
Fair value hedge accounting
Derivatives that are designated as hedging the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities are recognised as a
fair value hedge. Gains or losses on remeasurement of both the hedging instrument and the hedged item are
recognised in the Income statement within Other result on financial instruments.

INFORMATION
197de Volksbank N.V. Integrated Annual Report 2022
The same goes for the corresponding adjustment of the fair value of the hedged asset or hedged liability
attributable to the specific hedged risk. Hedge effectiveness for fair value hedges is measured as the amount
by which the changes in fair value of the derivatives compensates the changes in the fair value of the hedged
item.
When a fair value hedge of interest rate risk is terminated, any value adjustment to the carrying amount of the
hedged item is amortised to the income statement. The approach determines the amortisation period on the
underlying remaining interest rate maturity of the hedged item. As a result, value adjustments for individual
contracts are amortised over the respective maturity bucket. The moment the hedged position is no longer
recognised, i.e. is sold or redeemed, the non-amortised part of the fair value adjustment of the hedged asset is
recognised directly in the profit or loss.
De Volksbank applies fair value hedge accounting for portfolio hedges of interest rate risk as allowed under
the EU carve out version of IAS 39. The EU carve out enables a group of derivatives (or proportions thereof)
to be viewed in combination and jointly designated as the hedging instrument in the bank’s macro fair value
hedging models and removes some of the limitations in macro fair value hedge accounting with respect to
under hedging strategies. In addition, some restrictions on under-hedging strategies for fair value macro hedge
accounting do not apply. De Volksbank applies micro fair value hedging to hedge separate hedged positions,
which may be assets or liabilities.
Cashflow hedge accounting
Derivatives can be designated to hedge the risk of variability of future cashflows of a recognised asset
or liability or highly probable forecast transaction. Hedge ineffectiveness for cashflow hedges is measured
as the amount by which the changes in the fair value of the derivative are in excess of changes in the
fair value of the expected cashflow in the cashflow hedge. The effective part of any gain or loss on
remeasurement of the hedging instrument is recognised directly in the cashflow hedge reserve as a separate
component of total equity. Any ineffective part of the cashflow hedge is recognised in Other result on financial
instruments immediately. The valuation of the hedged item included in the cashflow hedge relationship,
remains unchanged.
If the forecast transaction leads to the recognition of an asset or a liability, the accumulated gains and
losses that were previously taken to the cashflow hedge reserve are transferred to the income statement
and classified as income or expense in the period during which the hedged transaction influences the result.
If the hedging instrument itself expires or is sold or terminated, or no longer meets the conditions for hedge
accounting, the accumulated result that was included in the cashflow hedge reserve fully remains in the
cashflow hedge reserve in other comprehensive income (OCI) until the expected transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the accumulated result reported in OCI is directly
recycled to the income statement.
Hedging
De Volksbank uses derivatives for the following objectives:
• To manage interest rate risk in the banking book and trading book;
• To hedge foreign exchange risks by converting non-euro funding and investments into euro;
• To use as economic hedging instrument for the prepayment risk on mortgage loans.
For a total overview of the derivatives, see Note 3 Derivatives.
HEDGE ACCOUNTING
In most of the hedging strategies explained above, de Volksbank applies hedge accounting. In addition to the
main distinction between fair value hedges and cashflow hedges, there is also a distinction between micro hedges
and macro hedges in hedge accounting. Micro hedging is a technique used to hedge individual contracts. Macro
hedging is a technique used to hedge the risk on a portfolio of contracts. The types of hedge accounting applied by
De Volksbank are explained below.
FAIR VALUE HEDGES
Hedging the interest rate risk in the banking book (macro hedge)
The portfolio hedged comprises fixed-rate mortgages of de Volksbank. The hedging instruments are interest rate
swaps entered into as part of the interest rate risk management in the ALM process. The risk hedged is the risk of
change in fair value of the portfolio attributable to movements in market interest rates. The hedge is set up and
terminated at least once a month. Effectiveness assessments are performed on a prospective and retrospective
basis and are measured using the dollar offset method.

Hedging the interest rate risk on investments (macro hedge)
The interest rate risk on fixed-income investments is hedged by swapping the coupon to a floating interest rate
with interest swaps. The country or credit spread risk component is not hedged. The hedges provide protection for
the accumulated revaluation reserve of the relevant fixed-income investments. The hedge is set up and terminated
at least once a month. Effectiveness assessments are performed on a prospective and a retrospective basis and
are measured using the dollar offset method.
Hedging the interest rate risk on funding (micro hedge)
De Volksbank conducts micro hedging to convert fixed-rate funding into floating interest rates by means of interest
rate swaps. If such funding is denominated in a foreign currency, cross-currency swaps are entered into. The
hedge is set up once and will not be terminated. Effectiveness assessments are performed on a prospective and
retrospective basis and are measured using the dollar offset method.
In addition to converting foreign currencies into euros and fixed-rate funding into floating-rate funding, de
Volksbank also uses derivatives to convert structured funding into floating-rate funding. In structured funding,
the funding charge is related to, for example, developments in an equity index or inflation. The funding programme
also includes interest rate structures such as floating-rate coupons with a multiplier or a leverage factor. De
Volksbank fully hedges the interest rate risk on these structures.
CASHFLOW HEDGES
Hedging floating interest rate cashflows
To reduce the variable interest rate cashflow risk arising from some specific investments or loans, de Volksbank
applies micro cashflow hedge accounting by means of interest rate swaps and, if such investment or loan is
denominated in a foreign currency, cross-currency interest rate swaps. By using these cross-currency interest rate
swaps not only the variability in cashflows, but also the foreign exchange risk arising from the investments or
loans is fully hedged, on the whole resulting in euro investments or loans. To apply micro hedge accounting, the
hedged item (investment or loan) and the hedging instrument (derivative) are linked together in specific hedge
relationships. Prospective effectiveness testing consists of matching the critical terms at inception of the hedge,
retrospective effectiveness testing consists of a monthly comparison of the change in the fair value of the hedged
cashflows and the fair value of the hedging instrument.
The accrued value of the derivatives is included in total equity over the remaining term of the hedge. The value
accrued in total equity was less than € 1 million as at 31 December 2022 (2021: also less than € 1 million).
In the years prior to 2019, de Volksbank also applied macro cashflow hedge accounting to hedge the risk of floating
interest rate cashflows on the cash position, floating interest rate mortgages, quotations and floating-rate funding
by entering into interest rate swaps and basis swaps. These hedges no longer exist. The value of these former
hedges accrued in total equity was € 23 million positive (gross) as at 31 December 2022 (2021: € 25 million positive
(gross)).

ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR INVESTMENTS AT AMORTISED COST
An investment in debt instruments is measured at amortised cost less any impairment losses if it is held as
part of a portfolio with an underlying business model to collect contractual cash flows until maturity (hold
to collect (HTC)). The cash flows of the investment shall solely consist of interest payments and principal
repayments (Solely Payments of Principal and Interest, or SPPI).
ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR INVESTMENTS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (OCI)
An investment in debt instruments is measured at fair value through OCI less any impairment losses if it
is held as part of a portfolio with an underlying business model to collect contractual cash flows and to
sell in the interim (hold to collect and sale (HTCS)). The cash flows of the investment in debt instruments
shall solely consist of interest payments and principal repayments. When the investments are sold, the
related accumulated fair value adjustments are recognised in the income statement as Investment income.
De Volksbank applies the average cost method to determine these results, where necessary.
ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR INVESTMENTS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS
An investment in debt or equity instruments is measured at fair value through profit or loss if it is held as part
of a portfolio with an underlying business model that qualifies as 'other' and/or the investment does not meet
the IFRS 9 criteria that the cash flows of the investment solely consist of interest payments and principal. The
business model 'other' is a business model that does not qualify as HTC or HTCS and may consist of trading
portfolios. Realised and unrealised gains and losses are recognised directly in the income statement under
Investment income. Interest income earned on securities is recognised as interest income. Dividend received is
recorded under Investment income.
Fair value changes of equity investments are recognised in profit or loss or in OCI following an irrevocable
election at initial recognition. This choice is made separately for each equity investment.
ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR IMPAIRMENT LOSSES OF INVESTMENTS
An expected credit loss (ECL) model is applied to financial assets valued at amortised cost and to financial
assets valued at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI). Under the ECL model, de Volksbank
calculates the probability that a default (PD) occurs at different moments in time. This is multiplied by the
difference between contractual cash flows due and the expected cash flows to be received, i.e. cash shortfall.
The provision is the sum of all cash shortfalls multiplied by the PD at the different moments in time. The
ECL calculations contain information about the past, present and future. In order to calculate the ECL, the
applicable PD, EAD and LGD are multiplied and discounted.

In 2022, the total value of investments decreased slightly from € 5,638 million in 2021 to € 5,591 million.
All debt securities were allocated to stage 1, as they were in 2021. The provision for credit losses on debt securities
rose by € 5 million to € 7 million. This increase was mainly driven by increased credit spreads on our fixed-income
portfolio.
In the first half of 2022, part of the HTC portfolio was sold and the associated hedges were unwound, mainly
caused by the increased credit risk at that time of some government bonds making them no longer appropriate in
the HTC investment mandate.
At the end of 2022 de Volksbank invested in certain debt securities issued by securitisation vehicles set up by other
parties, and outside the scope of de Volksbank's consolidation, amounting to € 70 million (2021: € 107 million).
The decrease is the result of three redemptions in 2022, partially compensated by one additional investment
in the highest tranche of Dutch Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities. All outstanding debt securities concern
mortgage-backed investments with an investment grade rating, which expose the bank to limited credit risk by
being senior in the payment waterfall of the securitisation vehicles.

ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR LOANS AND ADVANCES TO BANKS
Loans and advances to banks are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any
impairment losses based on an expected credit loss (ECL) model. This item includes receivables to banks with a
remaining maturity of one month or more.
This item relates to loans and advances to banks, excluding interest-bearing securities, and demand deposits
with the Dutch Central Bank (DNB).

The loans and advances to banks are classified in stage 1. The provision for credit losses went up to € 5 million
(2021: nil) driven by increased credit spreads.
The loans and advances to banks amount for € 88 million collateral posted on derivative transactions (2021:
€ 479 million).
7 Loans and advances to customers
ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR LOANS AND ADVANCES TO CUSTOMERS
Loans and advances to customers are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any
impairment losses.
Provisions for loans and advances to customers
Expected credit loss (ECL) provisions are recognised for credit exposures measured at amortised cost and loan
commitments and financial guarantee contracts (off-balance sheet items). Under the ECL model, de Volksbank
calculates the probability that a default (PD) occurs at different moments in time. This is multiplied by the
difference between contractual cash flows due and the expected cash flows to be received, i.e. ‘cash shortfall’.
The provision is the sum of all cash shortfalls multiplied by the PD at the different moments in time. The
ECL calculations contain information about the past, present and future. In order to calculate the ECL, the
applicable PD, EAD and LGD are multiplied and discounted.
A three-stage model is used under IFRS 9. In stage 1, de Volksbank recognises credit exposures that
have shown no significant increase of credit risk since initial recognition and a 12-month expected loss is
determined. Stage 2 comprises credit exposures that show a significant increase of credit risk relative to initial
recognition but that are not credit impaired are recognised. For these credit exposures, a lifetime expected
credit loss is determined. Credit exposures that are credit impaired are recognised in stage 3, for which also a
lifetime expected credit loss is determined. De Volksbank applies a specific default definition for each portfolio
for which loan loss provisions are determined under IFRS 9. For more information about the stage allocation
process, please refer to Section 4.3.3 Provisioning methodology.
Write-off
When writing off a loan, we make a distinction between the waiver of amounts payable and the write-off of a
residual debt. The following is a description of these terms:
1. Waiver of amounts payable: a (part of the) loan is written off if the waiver of amounts payable leads
to the customer's recovery. The consequence of this is that the customer can meet his or her payment
obligations again. Waivers of amounts payable are debited to the credit provision;
2. Write-off of residual debt: there may be a residual debt as a result of a recovery process. This residual debt
is fully provisioned for. Any collateral is realised during a period of 6 months after the execution process.
After this period, any remaining debt is written off.

De Volksbank has securitised part of the mortgage loans. The remaining principal of the securitised portfolio
amounts to € 8.2 billion (2021: € 11.9 billion), of which € 7.9 billion (2021: € 11.5 billion) is on own book. There is a
limited transfer of risks and benefits for the securitised mortgage loans. Therefore, they are not derecognised from
the balance sheet. Further information on securitisation transactions is provided under Note 14 Debt certificates
and for more information on intra-group transactions, see Note 23 Related parties. More information on asset
encumbrance can be found in Note 24 Transferred and encumbered assets.
The total provision for loans and advances amounted to € 154 million as at 31 December 2022 (year-end 2021:
€ 107 million). The increase in provisions was mainly due to the residential mortgage portfolio and a few individual
corporate loans.
Please refer for more information on loans and advances to customers to Section 4.3.3 Provisioning methodology
that describes the breakdown of the stages and gives information on the models used and to the Sections 4.3.4

'Audited', for quantitative and qualitative information on the portfolios.
8 Property, equipment and intangible assets
ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Land and buildings in own use
Property in own use mainly comprises offices (land and buildings) and is measured at cost net of accumulated
depreciation and, if applicable, impairment losses.
Buildings are depreciated over their economic life using the straight-line method, with a maximum of 50 years.
Land is not depreciated. An assessment is made whether there is an indication that land and buildings may be
impaired.
IT equipment and other assets
All other tangible assets included in this item are measured at cost net of accumulated depreciation and, if
applicable, accumulated impairment losses.
The cost price comprises the expenses directly attributable to the acquisition of the assets and is depreciated
on a straight- line basis over the useful life, taking into account any residual value. The estimated useful life
may vary from 3 to 10 years.
Results on the sale of property and equipment are recognised as negative depreciation.

De Volksbank accounts for business combinations when control is obtained by the bank. All items of the
consideration are measured and recognised at fair value at acquisition date. The excess of consideration over
the share of the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs in
connection to the purchase of the business combination are expensed as incurred.
Any change, in the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities at the acquisition date, determined within one
year after acquisition, is recognised as an adjustment charged to goodwill. Adjustments that occur after a
period of one year are recognised in the income statement.
General
Intangible assets are measured at cost net of accumulated amortisation and, if applicable, accumulated
impairment losses.
Software
Costs that are directly related to the development of identifiable software products that de Volksbank controls
and that are likely to generate economic benefits that exceed these costs, are capitalised as intangible assets.
The direct costs comprise external costs and staff costs directly attributable to software development. All other
costs associated with the development or maintenance of software are included as an expense in the period
during which they are incurred.
Other intangible assets
The other intangible assets of de Volksbank consist of distribution networks and are amortised in accordance
with the straight-line method over their estimated useful life, generally between five and fifteen years. If
objective indications require so, an impairment test will be performed.
ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR IMPAIRMENTS
Goodwill
Goodwill created with the acquisition of subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures is allocated to
cash-generating units (CGU). The book value of the CGU, including goodwill, is compared to the calculated
recoverable value, determined on the basis of value-in-use. If the recoverable value is lower than the book
value, the difference will be recognised as impairment in the income statement. Assumptions used in these
goodwill impairment tests are value-in-use based on the business plans and the allocated discount rate based
on the risk profile of the CGU.
General
An asset is subject to impairment if its book value exceeds the recoverable amount from continued use (value-
in-use) or sale of the asset. The recoverable amount is the highest value of the fair value less costs of disposal
and the value in use. The recoverable amount of assets is estimated if there are indications of impairment of
the asset. Intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least once a year. If such
intangible assets are initially recognised during the reporting period, they are tested for impairment before the
end of the reporting period.
Software and other intangible assets
On each reporting date, the capitalised costs for software, distribution channels and customer portfolios are
reviewed for indicators of potential impairments.
REVERSAL OF IMPAIRMENTS ON PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Except for goodwill, impairment losses on property, equipment and intangible assets are reversed if there is
proof that a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount occurred after the impairment
loss was recognised. The reversal is included under depreciations in the income statement. The book value
after reversal may never exceed the amount before recognition of the impairment loss.

9 Tax assets and liabilities
ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
Accounting policy for corporate tax
Corporate income tax relates to payable or recoverable tax on the taxable profit for the period under review,
and taxes due from previous periods. If any corporate income tax includes dividend withholding tax, this is
settled through the corporate income tax return. Current tax recoverables and payables are measured at
nominal value according to the tax rate applicable at the reporting date.
Accounting policy for deferred tax assets and liabilities
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for tax losses carried forward and for temporary differences
between the tax base of assets and liabilities and the book value. This is based on the tax rates applicable as
at the balance sheet date and the tax rates that will apply in the period in which the deferred tax assets or tax
liabilities are settled. Deferred taxes are measured at nominal value.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will allow the
deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred taxes are recognised for temporary differences between the book
value and the value for tax purposes of investments in group companies and associates, unless de Volksbank
is able to determine the time at which these temporary differences will end and if it is probable that these
differences will not end in the near future. Deferred tax assets are assessed at balance sheet date.
The most significant temporary differences arise from certain financial assets and liabilities, such as derivative
contracts and the application of hedge accounting, provisions for pensions and other post-retirement
employee plans, deductible losses carried forward and, as far as acquisitions are concerned, from the
difference between (a) the fair value of the acquired net assets and (b) the tax value.

11 Amounts due to banks
ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR AMOUNTS DUE TO BANKS
Amounts due to banks comprise unsubordinated debts to credit institutions. Amounts due to banks include
private loans, current accounts and repos.
At initial recognition, amounts due to banks in the banking book are measured at fair value, including
transaction costs incurred. Thereafter, they are measured at amortised cost.
Any difference between the measurement at initial recognition and the redemption value is recognised under
interest expense in the income statement during the term of these amounts owed by using the effective
interest method.
Amounts due to banks held for trading are measured at fair value through profit or loss. Unrealised and
realised gains or losses are recognised in Other result on financial instruments.

Total 2,805 1,059
Total cash collateral received went up in 2022 due to an increase in the positive current market value of derivatives,
which was driven by an increase in interest rates.
Under private loans, € 10 million (2021: € 5 million) relates to the placement of debt instruments (Schuldscheine)
with banks.
TLTRO
Amounts due to banks includes de Volksbank's participation in 2020 in the targeted longer term refinancing
operations III (TLTRO III.5) programme set up by the ECB in the amount of € 0.7 billion. In addition, in 2021, de
Volksbank participated for € 70 million in additional funding from the ECB (TLTRO III.7). The charged interest rate
under the TLTRO III programme contains a discount that is linked to the amount of loans granted to non-financial
corporations and households (excluding mortgages) and a positive net growth of these loans during a reference
period. In the assessment whether or not de Volksbank would qualify for the interest rate discount under TLTRO
III, de Volksbank took into account the amount of its outstanding eligible loans as well as the business forecasts
of expected net growth of these particular loans. De Volksbank determined that it is likely to qualify for the
interest rate discount. As the interest rate discount on TLTRO III is considered to be a below-market interest rate,
the discount qualifies as an income-related government grant according to IAS 20. The related negative interest
expenses amount to € 3.8 million (2021: € 7.6 million) and are presented as interest income on liabilities. The
TLTRO III programme has a legal maturity of three years, though each quarter there is a voluntary repayment
option. This option has also become available for TLTRO III.5 as of September 2021 and as from March 2022 for
TLTRO III.7. In the second quarter of 2022, de Volksbank made use of this voluntary repayment option and repaid
the TLTRO III funding in full.

As part of savings mortgage arrangement, de Volksbank and insurer Athora Netherlands have agreed that the
savings premiums the insurer receives from the customer will be held by the bank. These savings premiums and
the interest credited (the savings capital designated for mortgage redemption) mean that, in principle, the insurer
has an unsecured claim against the bank. To spread the insurer’s default risk, a cession/retrocession agreement
was concluded under which the insurer transfers the savings capital to the bank in exchange for a partial and
joint right to the savings-based mortgage claims. In 2022, the savings capital accrued totalled € 1,202 million (2021:
€ 1,296 million).
14 Debt certificates
ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR DEBT CERTIFICATES
Debt certificates include the non-subordinated bonds and other debt certificates with a fixed or variable
interest rate. At initial recognition outstanding debt certificates are measured at fair value, which ordinarily
corresponds to the issue proceeds (the fair value of the payment received) net of the transaction costs
incurred. Subsequently, these instruments are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest
method.
When de Volksbank purchases its own debt securities, these debt securities are derecognised.

1 MTN's before 2017 were issued under the name SNS Bank N.V.
The Medium Term Notes (MTM) comprise both private loans and public loans issued under the EMTN programme.
For a total of 4.3 billion (2021: € 4.2 billion) of MTM's , bonds were issued under the Covered Bond programme
by de Volksbank. Payment of interest and principal is guaranteed by a structured entity SPV, Volks Covered Bond
Company BV (‘CBC’). To enable CBC to fulfil its guarantee, de Volksbank legally transferred Dutch mortgage loans
originated by de Volksbank to CBC. Furthermore, de Volksbank offers protection against the deterioration of the
mortgage loans. CBC is fully consolidated by de Volksbank.
With regards to the covered bond programme, de Volksbank undertakes at the request of CBC to offer to transfer
eligible assets to CBC, provided that CBC shall only request a transfer of eligible assets if it determines that the
Asset Cover Test has been breached. The Asset Cover Test is an arithmetic test that determines the minimum
amount of assets needed to cover the liabilities guaranteed by CBC.
Certificates of deposit
Certificates of deposit are debt securities with a fixed interest rate and a short-term maturity. At the end of 2022,
de Volksbank issued € 100 million (2021: € 200 million) in Certificates of deposit.
Securitisation programmes
De Volksbank entered into securitisation programmes to obtain funding and to improve liquidity. Within these
programmes de Volksbank sells mortgage receivables originated by itself to a SPV. The SPV issues securitised notes
which are eligible collateral for the ECB. In most programmes, de Volksbank acts as investor of the securitised
notes. As the SPVs are set up for the benefit of de Volksbank and there is limited transfer of risks and rewards, de
Volksbank continues to consolidate the SPVs.
Debt certificates issued under Pearl and Lowland securitisation programmes
De Volksbank has securitised part of its mortgage loans. In these securitisation transactions, the economic
ownership of mortgage loans is transferred to separate companies. These loans were transferred at nominal
value plus a deferred purchase price. A positive result within the SPV's leads to the creation of a positive value
of the deferred purchase price. De Volksbank thus retains an economic interest in these companies. On the basis
of this economic interest and other criteria established by IFRS for dominant control, de Volksbank has these
companies fully consolidated in the financial statements.
Securitisation transactions have a so-called call + step-up structure. This means that after a specific call date, the
company will have the right to redeem the bonds early. Additionally, at this specific date, the coupon on the bonds
will be subject to a rise in interest rate (step-up). Under normal market conditions, this will create an economic
incentive to redeem the bonds early. An overview of the securitisations as at 31 December is provided below:

16 Provisions
ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR PROVISIONS
General
Provisions are made if de Volksbank has a present obligation, legally or constructive, arising from events in the
past, and to which it is more likely than not that the settlement of the obligation requires an outflow of assets,
and for which a reliable estimate of the size of the obligation can be made. Provisions are measured at the
present value of the expected future cashflows. Additions and any subsequent releases are recorded in the
related line item in the income statement.
Provision for employee benefits
De Volksbank recognises a provision for pension obligations and other employee commitments including
various forms of employee benefit plans such as health insurance, savings, mortgages and jubilee benefits
schemes. The measurement is based on the net present value taking into account actuarial assumptions.
Restructuring provision
The restructuring provision is a specific provision that consists of anticipated severance payments and other
costs that are directly related to restructuring programmes. These costs are accounted for in the period in
which a legally enforceable or constructive obligation to make the payment arises. No provision is formed for
costs or future operating losses stemming from continuing operations.
De Volksbank recognises severance payments if de Volksbank has demonstrably committed itself, to:
• the termination of the employment contracts of current employees in accordance with an announced
detailed formal plan without the option of the plan being withdrawn; or
• the payment of severance payments as a result of an offer to encourage voluntary redundancy that cannot
be withdrawn. Severance payments that are due after more than twelve months after the balance sheet
date are discounted.
Other provisions
Other provisions include legal provisions. De Volksbank recognises a provision for legal proceedings at the
balance sheet date for the estimated liability. The provision comprises an estimate of the payments due during
the course of the legal proceedings. Where relevant, any possible external coverage of the legal claim will result
in the recognition of an asset if and when payment to de Volksbank becomes virtually certain.

216 de Volksbank N.V. Integrated Annual Report 2022
At year-end 2021, the restructuring provision in relation to the agile way or working amounted to € 48 million.
The organisation is in the process of being structured differently and transitioning into a uniform and agile way of
working. This approach results in more efficient collaboration and a flatter organisation.
At year-end 2022, the restructuring provision was reassessed resulting in a release of € 23 million. This release
is the result of a rapidly changing regulatory environment, which requires additional professional expertise and
capacity within the bank, compared to the assumptions made in the initial restructuring plan drawn up in 2020.
The envisaged reduction in existing FTEs was adjusted in favour of re-employment in other vacancies mainly
related to additional regulatory and compliance topics, resulting in fewer redundancies.
During the year € 17 million of this provision has been used. The remaining restructuring provision at year-end
2022 amounted to € 13 million.
Employee commitments and other provisions are predominantly long-term in nature.
Other provisions increased mainly due to the provision for compensation of customers with a revolving consumer
credit and customers with overdraft facilities, which amounts to a total of € 20 million.
In 2021, there were various rulings on the interpretations and use of variable interest clauses in revolving credits
for consumer loans and mortgage products at other Dutch banks. The conclusion was that customers may expect
the interest rate on their revolving consumer loans to remain in line with the relevant market interest rate during
the term of a loan. Therefore, in 2021, de Volksbank provisioned € 15 million for the compensation scheme
for customers with a revolving consumer credit and execution costs of this scheme. In 2022, the compensation
scheme and calculation methodology was further enhanced and this led to an increase of the provision to
€ 17 million.
Furthermore, in 2022 de Volksbank announced that it will compensate retail customers of SNS and RegioBank on
their overdraft facilities in accordance to the Kifid ruling and provisioned € 3 million for this. In the coming period
de Volksbank will work out the compensation scheme for overdraft facilities.
Furthermore, we recognised a provision of € 5 million with respect to compensation for interest losses due to early
repayments on mortgages and we released a small amount of a provision for legal proceedings.

For the accounting principles and a more detailed explanation to the lease liabilities, see Note 18 Lease contracts.
Other mainly relates to amounts payable to customers and suppliers.
18 Lease contracts
A lease contract exists if control over the use of an identified asset for a certain period has been obtained in
exchange for consideration. The main lease contracts entered into by de Volksbank concern property leases.
De Volksbank recognises a lease liability if it has control over the underlying asset. The lease obligation is
valued at the present value of the lease payments that have not yet been made at that time. Because the
implicit interest rate of the lease contracts cannot be easily determined, the marginal interest rate of de
Volksbank is used. The lease payments are discounted using this marginal interest rate. During the term of a
contract, the lease liability is increased with accrued interest and reduced by lease payments. The lease liability
is adjusted for indexations of the lease payments, any changes to the contract or a modified estimate of any
extension or termination options.
The right-of-use asset is measured at cost minus cumulative depreciation and impairment. The processed
lease payments, initial direct costs and advance payments form part of the cost price. Any corrections to the
lease liability are accordingly processed in the right-of-use asset. The right-of-use asset is depreciated on a
straight-line basis over the remaining duration of the contract.
Lease contracts for buildings are usually entered into for a contractual period of 5 years. Extension and
termination options that are outside the 5-year period are not included in the determination of the lease
liability, because there is no reasonable certainty that instalments outside this period will be effected.
De Volksbank uses the option not to include short-term lease contracts and low-value lease contracts on the
balance sheet, but to include them in the result as an expense.
SUBLEASES
A number of store locations are subleased to franchisees. In addition, part of the head office is sublet to third
parties. As substantially all of the risks and rewards associated with the right to use the underlying asset have
been transferred to the sublessee, they are qualified as finance sublease contracts. A net investment in the
lease is recognised as a receivable in Other assets.

Fair value reserve
The fair value reserve includes the gains and losses, net of tax, resulting from a change in the fair value of
debt instruments measured at FVOCI. When the instruments are sold or otherwise disposed of, the related
cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is recycled to the income statement.
Cash flow hedging reserve
The cash flow hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value
of cash flow hedging instruments, net of taxes, that are recycled to the income statement if the hedged
transactions have an impact on profit or loss.
Other reserves
Other reserves mainly comprise retained earnings and profit for the period.
Dividends
Dividends on ordinary shares classified as equity are recognised as a distribution of equity in the period in
which they are approved by shareholders.
AT1 capital securities
Undated, deeply subordinated, resettable, callable capital securities are classified as Additional Tier 1 (AT1)
capital, under total equity.

Share capital
The issued share capital is fully paid up and comprises 840,008 ordinary shares with a nominal value of € 453.79
per share.
Reserves in equity
The share premium reserve did not change during the year.
The cashflow hedge reserve decreased slightly by € 2 million (2021: € 3 million).
The fair value reserve fell by € 157 million due to increased interest rates, which led to a decrease in the value of
the debt securities measured at fair value through OCI.
The other reserves including retained earnings increased due to result appropriation of the previous year by
€ 65 million (2021: € 70 million). This was partly offset by the interest paid on AT 1 capital securities in the amount
of € 11 million (2021: nil).
AT1 capital securities
Undated, deeply subordinated, resettable, callable capital securities are classified as Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital,
under total equity. In June 2022, de Volksbank issued its first AT1 notes. The perpetual callable AT1 notes amounted
to € 298 million (nominal value: € 300 million) and have a coupon rate of 7.00% up to the first reset date on
15 December 2027.
Dividend
Earnings per share are calculated by dividing the (proposed) dividend by the outstanding ordinary shares. The
Executive Board of de Volksbank proposes to pay out a dividend of € 90 million (2021: € 97 million) to its
shareholder NLFI. The proposed dividend per share is € 107 (2021: € 115).
In 2022 a final dividend payment of € 97 million (2021: € 104 million) was paid to its shareholder NLFI related to the
previous financial year. This came down to a dividend per share of € 115 (2021: € 124).
Non-controlling interest
On 1 September 2021, de Volksbank completed the acquisition of 90% of the shares of the property valuation
platform Fitrex B.V. The remaining 10% shares of Fitrex are recorded as a non-controlling interest and amounted to
€ 0.2 million at year-end 2022.
20 Contingent liabilities and commitments
ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS
Contingent liabilities
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events and its existence will be confirmed
only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control
of de Volksbank. A contingent liability may also be a present obligation that arises from past events but is not
recognised because it is either not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle
the obligation, or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured reliably. Contingent liabilities are not
recognised in the statement of financial position, but are disclosed in the notes unless the possibility of the
outflow of economic benefits is remote.
Financial guarantee contracts
A financial guarantee contract requires de Volksbank to make specified payments to the holder if certain
conditions are met. The holder of the contract is reimbursed for a loss it incurs if a specified debtor fails to
make payment when due under the original or modified terms of a debt instrument.

Loan commitment
Loan commitments are commitments to provide credit under pre-specified terms and conditions. The amounts
shown in the table for guarantees and commitments represent the maximum amount de Volksbank is exposed
to if the contract parties completely fail to perform as agreed. The ‘nominal amount’ best represents the bank’s
maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements.
Impairment losses for off-balance sheet items
Impairment losses for off-balance sheet items such as loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts
are recognised in the line item 16 Provisions. For further information on impairment losses, please refer to

Financial guarantees given
De Volksbank provides financial guarantees to guarantee customers' performance to third parties.
Loan commitments given
The loan commitments given mainly consist of credit facilities pledged to customers, but against which no
claim has yet been made, such as unused portions of irrevocable credit facilities granted to SME and corporate
customers, new loan offers, approved but undrawn loans, revolving, underwriting facilities and home construction
accounts. These facilities are pledged for a fixed term and at a variable interest rate. Collateral has been secured
for a part of the credit facilities.
Other commitments given
Some of the collateralised loans and advances of € 315 million (2021: € 368 million) were sold in the past by a
legal predecessor of de Volksbank. This sales transaction entails that, as a legal successor, de Volksbank has a
repurchase obligation on the interest repricing date and/or is obliged to convert the form of repayment of the
loans and advances. The repurchase price is equal to the outstanding principal adjusted for accrued savings capital
intended for mortgage repayments.
In addition, de Volksbank and SRLEV agreed in 2015 that de Volksbank would (re)purchase a mortgage portfolio
from SRLEV. The value of the mortgage portfolio to be repurchased was € 79 million as at 31 December 2021 (2021:
€ 96 million). The mortgages are repurchased on a monthly basis if a loan component meets certain conditions,
such as interest repricing date and the conversion of the form of redemption. The repurchase price is equal to the
outstanding principal adjusted for accrued savings capital that is intended for mortgage repayments.

Contingent liabilities
Customers with loans with variable interest rates
In 2021, there have been various rulings on the interpretations and use of variable interest clauses in revolving
credits for consumer loans and mortgage products at other Dutch banks. The conclusion of these rulings is that
customers may expect that the interest rate on their revolving loans remains in line with the relevant market
interest rate during the term of a loan. For revolving consumer credits and overdraft facilities de Volksbank formed
a provision. Credit cards are subject to further analysis. At the current stage, we do not have a present obligation
for credit cards.
Swiss cantonal banks
In 2021, de Volksbank reassessed its capital treatment policy for exposures to Swiss Cantons and the Swiss
cantonal banks guaranteed by Swiss Cantons. As a result of this reassessment, the risk weight of these assets was
adjusted from 0% to 20% as at 31 December 2021. In August 2022, de Volksbank received an information request
from the ECB, which includes information on the impact on the capital ratios for previous reporting periods. We
have submitted answers to this request and are now awaiting a response from the ECB. Depending on the ECB’s
findings, they may impose a measure.
Customer integrity
De Volksbank is determined to take all reasonable measures to prevent the bank and/or the financial system in
general for money laundering and terrorist financing. We have an ongoing dialogue with DNB on this subject. As
a result, we decided we need to further expand and deepen the improvement programme that started in 2020
enabling us to remediate and implement a future-proof and robust customer integrity framework. Furthermore, in
2022 DNB conducted a supervisory review within de Volksbank on customer integrity. We expect DNB findings in
the first half of 2023.
21 Legal proceedings
De Volksbank and its subsidiaries are, and may from time to time become involved in legal, regulatory and/or
arbitration proceedings that relate to claims by and against the bank, ensuing from its normal business operations.
In presenting the Consolidated Financial Statements, management estimates the outcome of these proceedings
and takes provisions when it is considered that there is a present obligation, it is probable that a cash outflow
is required and the amount can be estimated with sufficient reliability. The most important proceedings are
described below. For the below described legal proceedings it is not considered probable that there will be a cash
outflow. As such these matters are regarded as contingencies.
MADOFF
In 2010, liquidators of three Madoff-feeder funds (the "Feeder Funds") initiated legal proceedings in New York
against, amongst others, the custody entity of de Volksbank, SNS Global Custody, and its clients as former
beneficial owners of investments in these funds. They claim repayment of payments made by the Feeder Funds
for redemptions of investments by these beneficial owners. A similar proceeding was initiated by the liquidators
against SNS Global Custody and other defendants in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), which proceedings have ended
in favour of de Volksbank. In line with these lawsuits, Bernard Madoff's trustee has also initiated proceedings in
New York against, amongst others, de Volksbank and SNS Global Custody.
The status of the aforementioned proceedings in New York (in which many financial institutions worldwide are
sued in similar proceedings) is as follows:
• Fairfield Funds. In April 2019, the New York bankruptcy court dismissed all claims brought by the Fairfield Funds
liquidators against SNS Global Custody except for claims under the BVI Insolvency Act. The Fairfield Funds
liquidators have appealed that ruling to the New York district court (appeal 1). A decision by the district court

is expected in the coming months. In the meantime, the Fairfield Funds liquidators have filed an amended
complaint against SNS Global Custody in the New York bankruptcy court with respect to their BVI Insolvency Act
claims. On 14 December 2020 the New York bankruptcy court issued a decision in favour of SNS Global Custody.
Fairfield Funds liquidators have appealed to the district court against the bankruptcy court's decision (appeal 2).
The district court affirmed on 24 August 2022 the bankruptcy court’s dismissal of the Liquidators’ claims in both
appeals for the district court. The Liquidators have appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit.
• Madoff Trustee. In November 2016, the New York bankruptcy court issued a decision on preliminary issues
that resulted in the dismissal of all claims asserted by the Madoff trustee against de Volksbank and SNS Global
Custody. The Madoff trustee appealed this decision to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, which overturned
the bankruptcy court’s decision in February 2019. A request by a group of defendants, including de Volksbank
and SNS Global Custody, to the U.S. Supreme Court to hear an appeal of the Second Circuit’s decision has been
declined. The case has been referred back to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings. Briefing on the
complaint before the bankruptcy court started in October 2022.
• De Volksbank defends itself in each of these proceedings. In view of the complexity of the Madoff cases and
the various procedural possibilities that are still open or in the initial phase, it is not possible at this moment to
make a reliable assessment as to whether de Volksbank is ultimately obliged to actually pay any amounts.
PROCEEDINGS FOLLOWING THE NATIONALISATION
General
Various former holders of the securities and capital components expropriated in 2013 have initiated legal
proceedings to seek compensation for damages. At the time that the financial statements were drawn up, no
court proceedings had (yet) been initiated against de Volksbank other than those stated below. Currently, it is not
possible to make an estimate of the probability that possible legal proceedings of former holders or other parties
affected by the nationalisation may result in a liability, or the level of the financial impact on de Volksbank. For this
reason, at year-end 2022 no provisions were made in respect of possible legal actions by former holders and other
affected parties.
As the outcomes of possible legal proceedings cannot be predicted with any certainty, it cannot be ruled out that a
negative outcome may have a material negative financial impact on the capital position, results and/or cashflows of
de Volksbank.
Inquiry proceedings by Dutch Investors’ Association
In November 2014, the Dutch Investors’ Association (Vereniging van Effectenbezitters; ‘VEB’) and other investors filed
a petition with the Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal (the Enterprise Chamber) for an inquiry
into the management of SNS REAAL, currently SRH, SNS Bank, currently de Volksbank, and former SNS Property
Finance, currently Propertize. Other parties concerned have joined these proceedings. SRH, de Volksbank and
Propertize disputed the authority to file a petition for an inquiry. The Enterprise Chamber rejected the request
related to Propertize and granted (after remission by the Supreme Court) the request related to SRH and de
Volksbank.
On 8 topics, the Enterprise Chamber ordered an inquiry into the management and course of events at SRH and
de Volksbank for the period from 1 July 2006 until 1 February 2013. The appointed investigators’ final report on
the inquiry was published on 27 July 2021. On 27 September 2021, the VEB requested the Enterprise Chamber in
a subsequent procedure to establish mismanagement ('wanbeleid') of SRH and de Volksbank in the period from
1 July 2006 until 1 February 2013. An oral hearing took place on 17 February 2022. The judgement of the Enterprise
Chamber was delivered on 30 November 2022. The Enterprise Chamber ruled that there was no 'wanbeleid' with
regard to SRH and de Volksbank. The VEB's claims have all been rejected. The Enterprise Chamber did rule that
errors were made in some areas, which is not surprising given the length of the investigation period and the
extremely turbulent times. None of the parties lodged an appeal in cassation, so the decision of the Enterprise
Chamber has force of judgement. The VEB is still investigating whether it will start liability proceedings. SRH and de
Volksbank await developments. As such, no obligation existed at year end 31 December 2022.
Guarantees pursuant to section 2:403, Volume 2 of the Dutch Civil Code for Propertize et al.
In the context of the transfer of Propertize et al., SRH and de Volksbank have withdrawn the 403 Guarantees issued
for Propertize et al. in the past. This withdrawal has become irrevocable for all creditors, with the exception of CRI
(Commerz Real Investment Gesellschaft GmbH). CRI raised an objection to the withdrawal of the 403 Guarantees.
This objection was declared well-founded up to the highest instance in a Supreme Court decision of 31 March
2017. In September 2020, CRI started proceedings against (i.a.) Propertize with regard to a defect air control system
and estimated the claim in the first instance at € 250,000, but asked the court to assess the damages.
Other proceedings relevant to de Volksbank
In addition, there are proceedings to which de Volksbank is not a party or in which it is not the direct subject of an
investigation, but of which the course and results may have a material impact on de Volksbank’s position.

This is the case for the compensation proceedings against the State before the Enterprise Chamber initiated
by former holders of expropriated securities and capital components of SRH and de Volksbank. Following initial
proceedings leading to a Supreme Court ruling on the basic principles for the assessment of the value of the
expropriated securities and capital components, the Enterprise Chamber appointed three experts. The experts
presented their first report on 27 April 2018. Following comments from the parties to the proceedings and a new
ruling by the Enterprise Chamber, the experts produced an additional report in September 2019. Parties to the
proceedings were entitled to respond to this report until the beginning of November 2019 at the latest, after which
the experts filed their final report on 21 November 2019 with the Enterprise Chamber. The judgement was given
on 11 February 2021. The Enterprise Chamber assessed the compensation (in total) at € 804,810,000. On 11 May
2021, the State lodged an appeal in cassation with the Supreme Court. The Advocate General gave his advice to the
Supreme Court on 8 July 2022. He advised to maintain the judgement of the Enterprise Chamber of 11 February
2021. The expected date of the judgement of the Supreme Court is 10 March 2023. The position of subordinated
creditors of SRH and de Volksbank will be clear after the judgement in last instance is given. The State – in case
payment will have to be made to expropriated share-and bondholders – will have to pay the parties. There are no
indications of legal grounds on which the claim will or could be transferred to de Volksbank. As such, no obligation
existed at year end 31 December 2022.
22 Specific disclosures of financial instruments
ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR FAIR VALUE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities is determined on the basis of quoted prices where available.
Such quoted prices are primarily derived from transaction prices for listed instruments. If quoted prices are
not available, market prices from independent market participants or other experts are used. De Volksbank
applies an exit price when determining fair value, therefore financial assets are recognised at their bid prices
and financial liabilities at their offer prices.
In markets where activity has decreased or in inactive markets, the range of prices from different sources can
be significant for a certain financial instrument. Selecting the most appropriate price requires management
judgement.
For certain financial assets and liabilities, no market price is available. The fair value of these financial assets
and liabilities is determined using valuation techniques, which may vary from discounted cashflow calculation
to valuation models that use generally accepted economic methodologies. Observable market information,
where available, is used as input for the valuation models. All valuation methods used are assessed and
approved in-house according to de Volksbank’s governance procedures.
De Volksbank determines the fair value hierarchy for all financial instruments at each reporting moment.
NOTES TO THE VALUATION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
The following techniques and assumptions have been used to determine the fair value of financial instruments.
Investments
The fair values of shares are based on quoted prices in active markets or other available market data. The
fair values of interest-bearing securities, excluding mortgage loans, are also based on quoted market prices or,
when actively quoted market prices are not available, on the present value of expected future cashflows. These
present values are based on the relevant market interest rate, taking account of the liquidity, creditworthiness and
maturity of the relevant investment.
Loans and advances to customers
The fair value of mortgages is determined on the basis of a present value method. The yield curve used to
determine the present value of expected cashflows of mortgage loans is the average of the five lowest mortgage
rates in the market, adjusted for interest rates that are considered not to be representative (‘teaser rates’). These
rates may differ for each sub-portfolio due to differences in maturity, Loan-to-Value class and form of repayment.
In determining the expected cashflows, any expected future early redemptions are taken into account.
The fair value of other loans and advances to customers has been determined by the present value of the expected
future cashflows. Various surcharges on the yield curve were used for the calculation of the present value. In this
respect, a distinction was made by type of loan and customer group to which the loan relates.

224 de Volksbank N.V. Integrated Annual Report 2022
Derivatives
The fair values of nearly all derivatives are based on observable market information, such as market rates and
foreign exchange rates. To determine the fair value of instruments for which not all information is observable in
the market, estimates or assumptions are used within a net discounted cashflow model or an option valuation
model. In determining the fair value, the credit risk that a market participant would include in his valuation is taken
into account.
Loans and advances to banks
Given the short-term nature of the loans that are classified as loans and advances to banks, the book value is
considered to be a reasonable approximation of the fair value.
Other assets
Because of the predominantly short-term nature of other assets, the book value is considered to be a reasonable
approximation of the fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents
The book value of the cash and cash equivalents is considered to be a reasonable approximation of the fair value.
Subordinated debt
The fair values of subordinated debt are based on quoted prices in active markets or other available market data.
Debt certificates
The fair values of debt certificates are based on quoted prices in active markets or other available market data.
When actively quoted market prices are not available, the fair value of debt certificates is estimated on the basis
of the present value of the cashflows, making use of the prevailing interest rate plus a risk surcharge. The risk
surcharge is based on the credit risk assumed by the market for holding such instruments issued by de Volksbank,
determined by maturity and type of instrument.
Amounts due to customers
The fair value of readily available savings and term deposits differs from the nominal value because the interest
is not adjusted on a daily basis and because, in practice, customers leave their savings in their accounts for a
longer period of time. The fair value of these deposits is calculated based on the net present value of the relevant
portfolios’ cashflows using a specific discount curve. For savings covered by the Deposit Guarantee Scheme (DGS),
the discount curve is based on the average current rates of several Dutch market parties. De Volksbank’s Funds
Price-curve (FTP) was used for savings not covered by the DGS. The calculated fair value of amounts due to
customers with a demand feature cannot be less than the amount payable on demand.
Amounts due to banks
The fair value of amounts due to banks is estimated on the basis of the present value of the expected future
cashflows, using the interest rate plus a risk surcharge. The risk surcharge is based on the credit risk assumed by
the market for holding such instruments issued by de Volksbank, differentiated to maturity and type of instrument.
The book value of any amount due within one month is considered to be a reasonable approximation of the fair
value.
Other liabilities
The book value of other liabilities is considered to be a reasonable approximation of its fair value.
HIERARCHY IN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
A part of the financial instruments is measured in the balance sheet at fair value. In addition, the fair value
of the other financial instruments is disclosed. The fair value level classification is not disclosed for financial
assets and liabilities where the book value is a reasonable approximation of the fair value.
More detailed explanation of the level classification
For financial instruments measured at fair value on the balance sheet or for which the fair value is disclosed,
this fair value is classified into a level. This level depends on the parameters used to determine the fair value
and provides further insight into the valuation. The levels are explained below:
Level 1 – Fair value based on published stock prices in an active market
For all financial instruments in this valuation category, stock prices are observable and publicly available from
stock exchanges, brokers or pricing institutions. In addition, these financial instruments are traded on an
active market, which allows for the stock prices to accurately reflect current and regularly recurring market

transactions between independent parties. The investments in this category mainly include listed shares and
bonds.
Level 2 – Fair value based on observable market data
The category includes financial instruments for which no quoted prices are available but whose fair value
is determined using models where the parameters include available market information. These instruments
mostly contain privately negotiated derivatives. This category also includes investments for which prices have
been issued by brokers, but which are also subject to inactive markets. In that case, the available prices are
largely supported and validated using market information, including market rates and actual risk surcharges
related to different credit ratings and sector classifications.
Level 3 – Fair value not based on observable market data
A significant part of the financial instruments in this category has been determined using assumptions and
parameters that are not observable in the market, such as assumed default rates belonging to certain ratings.
The level 3 valuations of investments (shares) are based on quotes from illiquid markets. The derivatives in
level 3 are related to some mortgage securitisations and the valuation is partly dependent on the underlying
mortgage portfolios and movements in risk spreads.

The fair values represent the amounts at which the financial instruments could have been sold or transferred at
balance sheet date between market parties in an orderly transaction. The fair value of financial assets and liabilities
is based on quoted market prices, where observable. If actively quoted market prices are not available, various
valuation techniques have been used to measure the fair value of these instruments. Parameters used in such
valuation techniques may be subjective and are based on various assumptions, for instance certain discount rates
and the timing and size of expected future cashflows. The degree of subjectivity affects the fair value hierarchy,
which is discussed in the beginning of the paragraph. Wherever possible and available, the valuation techniques
make use of observable inputs in relevant markets. Changes in the assumptions can significantly influence the
estimated fair values. The main assumptions for each balance sheet item are explained in the section below.

SENSITIVITY OF LEVEL 3 VALUATIONS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Level 3 financial instruments are largely valued using a net discounted cashflow method in which expectations and
projections of future cashflows are discounted to a present value on the basis of market data. The models use
market observable information, such as yield curves, or information that is not observable in the market, such as
assumptions about certain credit risk surcharges or assumptions about customer behaviour. The valuation of a
level 3 instrument may change significantly as a result of changes in these assumptions.

main non-market observable parameters for determining the fair value of level 3 instruments are the applied
estimate of early redemptions and the discount curve.
The level 3 derivatives relate to securitisation transactions. Here there is a relationship between the fair values. This
is due to the fact that the derivatives of the SPVs (front swaps), which are part of the securitisation programme
Pearl, are entered into back-to-back with the same counterparties (back swaps). As a result, the fair value changes
of the front and back swaps are always comparable, but opposite.

24 Transferred and encumbered assets
ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR TRANSFERRED AND ENCUMBERED ASSSETS
Transferred financial assets are transactions for which de Volksbank has:
• transferred the contractual rights to receive the cashflows of the financial asset to a third party or parties,
or;
• retained the contractual rights to receive the cashflows of that financial asset, but assumes a contractual
obligation to pay the cashflows to a third party or parties.
Depending on additional circumstances regarding the transfer of risks and rewards, the transfer of the cash
flows may either result in the financial assets being derecognised or in financial assets that continue to be
recognised on the balance sheet. If transferred financial assets continue to be recognised on the balance sheet,
de Volksbank is still exposed to changes in the fair value of the assets.
Encumbered assets are assets that can be used as collateral for funding, for example mortgages used as
collateral for covered bond programs, securitised assets and collateral for certain repurchase agreement (repo)
transactions. In addition, the mandatory cash reserve is also included in encumbered assets. Assets that are
committed to undrawn credit facilities are not regarded as encumbered, for example, securitisation notes held
by the bank itself which qualify as eligible collateral for the European Central Bank.
The following table shows the transferred assets from which the contractual rights to receive a cashflow have
been transferred. The transferred assets mainly consist of securitised mortgages that have been transferred to a
third party. The related liabilities are also presented in this table. The structured entities for the securitisations are
consolidated. In all these cases the transfer of contractual rights to receive a cashflow did not result in the transfer
of risks and rewards. Therefore, the assets continue to be recognised on the consolidated balance sheet.

25 Post balance sheet events
On 28 February 2023, de Volksbank successfully issued € 0.5 billion of green senior non-preferred notes with a
maturity of seven years to further strengthen our MREL position.
There were no other material post balance sheet events that could require disclosure or adjustment to the
31 December 2022 financial statements.
26 Net interest income
ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR NET INTEREST INCOME
Interest income
Interest income comprises interest income on financial assets that is attributable to the period. Interest on
financial assets is almost completely accounted for using the effective interest method. A limited part of the
interest income relates to financial assets, mainly derivatives in a hedge relationship and trading positions,
measured at fair value through profit or loss and is recognised based on nominal interest rates.
The effective interest method is based on the estimated future cash flows, taking into account the risk
of early redemption of the financial instruments and the direct costs and income, such as the transaction
costs charged, brokerage fees and discounts or premiums. If the risk of early redemption cannot be reliably
determined, de Volksbank calculates the cash flows over the full contractual term of the financial instruments.
Commitment fees, together with the related direct costs, are included in the net interest income and accounted
for using the effective interest method.
For credit-impaired assets valued at amortised cost, i.e. less any impairment losses, interest income consists of
the time value of money.
Interest expenses
Interest expenses comprise interest expenses arising from financial liabilities. Interest expenses on financial
liabilities that are valued at amortised cost are accounted for using the effective interest method, whereas
interest expenses on financial liabilities that are classified at fair value through profit or loss are accounted for
based on nominal interest rates.

Net interest income
in € millions 2022 2021
 
Interest income 1,128 1,043
Interest expenses 277 268
Net interest income 851 775
Net interest income increased by € 76 million to € 851 million (+10%) and the net interest margin rose to 1.15%
(2021: 1.11%). Both increases were mainly driven by the more favourable interest rate environment in the second
half of 2022. As a result of rising interest rates, the interest on liquidities deposited with financial institutions, such
as the ECB, went up, showing a swing from interest paid to interest received. In addition, interest income on our
investment portfolio increased, while expenses to hedge our interest rate risk decreased.
Interest expenses on savings also went down slightly. Until 1 October 2022, our brands charged 0.5% interest per
year on that part of the balance that exceeded € 100,000, due to the low and negative interest rates on financial
markets. As from 1 October 2022, we no longer charged negative interest rates and as from 1 December 2022 our
brands started offering a positive savings rate. In 2022, savings deposits at de Volksbank decreased by € 1.1 billion
to € 44.5 billion, mainly driven by the changed interest rate environment and the introduction of a monthly fee for
the basic banking package. In a market in which household savings grew, our market share decreased to 10.4%,
from 11.3% at year-end 2021.
Finally, 2021 included a charge of € 13 million related to a provision to compensate customers with a consumer
facility with variable rates. For the expansion of the compensation scheme, we increased the provision by an
additional amount of € 5 million in 2022.
The aforementioned positive items were partly offset by lower mortgage income, higher wholesale funding
expenses and reduced compensation for loss of interest income due to mortgage prepayments.
Income on mortgages decreased as a result of interest rate renewals at lower rates. On top of that, new mortgage
production was concluded at lower rates than the rates of repaid mortgages. In 2022, the residential mortgage
portfolio, excluding IFRS value adjustments16, showed an increase to € 48.3 billion (year-end 2021: € 47.2 billion).
Wholesale funding expenses were higher due to issuances of senior non-preferred debt - to strengthen our MREL
ratio - and covered bonds.
Compensation for loss of interest income due to mortgage prepayments declined sharply in the second half
of 2022 as mortgage rates rose significantly and the mortgage refinancing market contracted accordingly. For
the whole year, this compensation amounted to € 70 million, which was below the level received in 2021
(€ 103 million). The compensation amount in 2022 included a € 20 million gain related to the refinement of
the amortisation model. Please refer to the Changes in accounting policies, estimates and presentation for this
refinement.
At year-end 2022 the interest income on impaired assets (stage 3) was equal to € 11 million (2021: € 13 million).

27 Net fee and commission income
ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR NET FEE AND COMMISSION INCOME
Fee and commission income consists of income from securities transactions of customers, asset management
and other related services offered by de Volksbank.
Fee and commission income is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the bank
expects to be entitled in exchange for providing the services. At inception of the contract, the performance
obligations, including the timing of satisfaction, are identified and determined. Fee and commission income is
invoiced and immediately due upon satisfaction of the service provided at a point in time or invoiced at the
end of the contract period for services provided over time. Fee and commission income is recognised in the
reporting period in which the services are rendered.
Commission expenses and management fees are accounted for as ‘fee and commission expenses’ to the
extent services are acquired in the reporting period.

B.V. (acquired on 1 September 2021). In addition, payment fees went up and the introduction of a monthly rate for
the basic banking package contributed to the rise in net fee income.
Management fees were below last year's level as assets under management decreased by € 0.8 billion to

28 Investment income
ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR INVESTMENT INCOME
Investment income consists of dividend income and unrealised and realised gains or losses for debt- and
equity securities.
Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised in the income statement when entitlement is established. For listed securities,
this is the date on which these securities are quoted ex-dividend.
Unrealised and realised gains or losses
This includes the unrealised and realised gains or losses for investments in the following categories:
• Amortised cost (realised);
• Fair value through other comprehensive income (realised);
• Fair value through profit or loss (unrealised and realised).

Investment income amounted to € 8 million negative, compared to € 3 million positive in 2021. In both years
investment income consisted entirely of realised results on fixed-income investments, sold as part of asset and
liability management and the optimisation of the investment portfolio.
The realised losses of € 9 million consisted of a € 13 million negative result in the HTCS portfolio and a€ 4 million
positive result in the HTC portfolio. In the first half of 2022, part of the HTC portfolio was sold and the associated
hedges were unwound, mainly caused by the increased credit risk at that time of some government bonds making
them no longer appropriate in the HTC investment mandate.
29 Other results on financial instruments
ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR OTHER RESULTS ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
This line item includes revaluation results on derivatives and other financial instruments classified as fair value
through profit and loss. Derivatives are recognised at fair value. The profit or loss from revaluation at fair value
is immediately recognised in the profit and loss account in the item Other results on financial instruments. For
derivatives that are designated as a hedging instrument, the recognition of a resulting revaluation gain or loss
depends on the nature of the hedge relationship (reference is made to Note 4 Hedging and hedge accounting).
Fair value movements in the hedged item attributable to hedged risk are also included in this line item as well
as the ineffective portion of any gains or losses of hedge relations.
Furthermore, this line item includes realised results from buy backs of own debt certificates.

Other results on financial instruments increased to € 70 million, compared to € 10 million for the previous year.
This high level was driven by exceptional circumstances in the financial markets, which were reflected in the
sharp rise in ECB interest rates and persistently high market volatility. The result in 2022 was mainly driven
by an exceptional amount of € 46 million for swaptions, used to protect the bank's long-term interest income
against sharply rising market interest rates (hedge programme). As the reason for protection occurred in 2022,
a non-recurring gain was realised. In addition, treasury results improved on the back of the changing market
environment. Hedge accounting results also increased due to results on derivatives related to investments sold.
These were partly offset by lower results on hedge accounting ineffectiveness of mortgages. Although the relative
hedge effectiveness was high, market value movements of derivatives and related mortgages were significant,
driven by sharply rising interest rates.
30 Other operating income
ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR OTHER OPERATING INCOME
This comprises all other income that cannot be accounted for under the aforementioned line items of the
income statement. Income is recognised at nominal value in the reporting period to which it relates.
Total other operating income in 2022 amounted to €1 million (2021: nil).

ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR STAFF COSTS
These costs comprise all costs related to personnel. This includes salaries, social security costs, pension costs
and other salary-related costs. Staff costs are recognised in the period in which the employees provide the
services to which the payments relate. The accounting policies for employee benefits are included in Note 16
Provisions.

Staff costs decreased by € 31 million, as Other staff costs included a release of the agile restructuring provision of
€ 23 million. Excluding this release, staff costs decreased by € 8 million, partly due to a decrease in total FTEs as a
result of the successful roll-out of the agile way of working. Compared to year-end 2021, the total number of FTEs
declined by 74 to 3,887, consisting of a reduction of 55 internal FTEs to 3,123 and of 19 external FTEs to 764.
The pension rights of the employees of de Volksbank are included in the Defined Contribution Plan of the
independent Stichting Pensioenfonds SNS REAAL. De Volksbank paid an employer's contribution for the accrual
of new rights, that is linked to the target accrual of 1.875%. However, this contribution is capped at 24% of gross
wages. A percentage of 24% of gross wages was paid in 2022 (2021: 24%). As there is no commitment either
enforceable by law or otherwise to pay additional contributions, pension benefits and related investments have
not been included in the balance sheet. Employees paid an employee contribution of 5% (2021: 5%) of pensionable
earnings after deduction of the contribution-free amount. This 5% was part of the 24% employer's contribution
and is simultaneously paid to the fund. The existing administration agreement with Stichting Pensioenfonds SNS
REAAL has been extended by two years until 31 December 2024.

The variable remuneration for senior management was abolished in 2018 and no variable remuneration has been
paid out since than. Before abolition of the variable remuneration, the revised Regulation on Sound Remuneration
Policies (RBB) came into force as from 1 January 2012. Under this regulation, a possible variable remuneration
awarded to de Volksbank staff was partly awarded in phantom shares. The fair value per phantom share is
obtained by comparing the equity at the end of the year of performance against the number of outstanding
ordinary shares (initial value). Subsequently, the share will annually be revalued with the results of the current year.
The value development of the phantom shares is based on the development of de Volksbank's results, possibly
adjusted for non-recurring income or expenses. The value of the phantom shares is paid in phases in cash, one
part after 1 year and the remaining part after a 4-year time period. The last phantom shares were awarded in
2017. At year-end 2022, there are no phantom shares outstanding (2021: € 3,855). This decrease is the result of
distributions made in 2022.

up. The increase was partly compensated by lower marketing costs.

The European Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive was implemented in Dutch legislation on 26 November 2015.
This directive establishes common standards across the EU and aims to strengthen the protection of depositors. It
ensures that depositors will continue to benefit from a guaranteed coverage up to € 100,000 in case of bankruptcy.
This will be backed by funds that will be collected from the banking sector. A significant component of the rules
is a pre-funded Deposit Guarantee Scheme (DGS). In the DGS, banks pay quarterly contributions into a Deposit
Guarantee Fund (DGF). The level of the contribution paid by de Volksbank depends on the amount of guaranteed
deposits at de Volksbank and the risk profile, partly in relation to the other banks that are part of the scheme. The
target size of the DGF is equal to 0.8% of the total guaranteed deposits of the banks collectively, a target that has to
be reached by 2024.
In 2022, de Volksbank paid € 55 million to the DGS (2021: € 68 million). The lower DGS contribution was mainly due
to lower covered deposit growth year-on-year.
In order to finance an orderly winding up of failing banks, a National Resolution Funds (NRF) was established
in 2015, which is ex-ante financed by contributions raised from the banks. The NRF was replaced by the Single
Resolution Fund (SRF) as from 2016. The SRF builds up over eight years, reaching a target level of at least 1% of the
amount of covered deposits of all credit institutions of all the participating member states.
In 2022, de Volksbank contributed € 14 million to the NFR (2021: €11 million).

The audit fees relate to the financial year to which the financial statements pertain, regardless of whether the
external auditor and the audit firm performed the work during the financial year.
In addition to the statutory audit and the performance of other statutory audits, the auditor also provides a
number of other assurance services. These other assurance services consist of the review of interim financial
information, the assessment of non-financial information as included in the integrated annual report, internal
control (ISAE 3402) reports and activities related to the separation of assets, cost price model, prospectuses
and bond issues. Furthermore, these activities include reporting activities to the regulatory authority and
securitisations and the covered bond programme in relation to mortgage pools within the context of outsourcing.
33 Impairment charges (reversals) of financial assets
ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR IMPAIRMENT CHARGES (REVERSALS) OF FINANCIAL ASSETS
Financial assets measured at amortised cost and fair value through OCI, including loan commitments and
financial guarantee contracts (off-balance sheet positions) are subject to impairments. An impairment is
recognised in the income statement. The accounting principles for impairment are explained in more detail
in the accounting principles of the balance sheet items that are subject to impairments. For more information
about the stage allocation process and associated provisioning methodology, please refer to Section 4.3.3
Provisioning methodology.

Total impairment charges of financial assets 52 -58
Total impairment charges of financial assets amounted to € 52 million in 2022, compared to a reversal of
€ 58 million in 2021. Actual defaults of residential mortgages and SME loans remained very low, but the
deteriorated economic outlook used in our provisioning models resulted in a higher level of impairments. For
a more detailed description of the impairments based on the Expected Credit Loss model in line with IFRS 9, see
Section 4.3 Credit risk.
Residential mortgages
In 2022, we took an impairment charge of € 17 million for residential mortgages, where a reversal of € 46 million
was recognised in 2021. The overall loan loss provision includes a management overlay, which decreased in 2022.
This decrease was mainly driven by a release of the Covid-19-related overlay as the impact of the virus on society

was not as negative as initially estimated, and by a release of the management overlay for an adjusted scenario
simulating the house price development. Conversely, a new management overlay has been included to account for
the risk of high inflation affecting our customers' ability to repay their loan(s). The management overlay decrease
was more than offset by an increase in modelled provisions driven by a less positive macroeconomic outlook, most
notably lower expected house prices, and model improvements.
The reversal in 2021 followed from an improved macroeconomic outlook, most notably rising house prices. The
positive impact from the improved outlook was partly offset by the application of a higher management overlay as
the uncertainty remained high at this point in time.
Consumer loans
Impairment charges on other consumer loans consisted of a reversal of € 3 million, as opposed to a charge of
€ 3 million in 2021. The charge in 2021 was mainly driven by the implementation of a new regulatory definition of
default.
SME loans
Impairment charges on SME loans consisted of a small charge of € 2 million as the credit quality of the portfolio
remained sound. In 2021 there was a reversal of € 12 million, driven by an improved macroeconomic outlook, in
particular an expected reduction in the number of insolvencies.
Other corporate and government loans
Impairment charges on other corporate and government loans rose to € 23 million, caused by increased credit
risk of a few individual loans provided. In 2021, impairment charges on other corporate and government loans
consisted of a reversal of € 4 million as the credit risk on the same loans decreased.
Loans to banks
Impairment charges on loans to banks amounted to € 5 million (2021: nil), driven by increased credit spreads.
Investments
Impairment charges on investments amounted to € 8 million, compared to € 1 million in 2021. This increase was
mainly driven by increased credit spreads on our fixed-income portfolio.
34 Taxation
ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR TAXATION
Income tax consists of current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement in the
period in which profits arise and measured using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date.

Principles for the preparation of the company financial statements
When preparing the company financial statements, de Volksbank N.V. makes use of the option offered in Book
2, Section 362 (8) of the Dutch Civil Code of applying the same principles for valuation and the determination of
the results as are used in the consolidated financial statements for the company financial statements. Reference
is made to the accounting principles for the consolidated financial statements. The presentation and notes in the
company financial statements are based on Title 9, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
For additional information on items not explained further in the notes to the company statement of financial
position, reference is made to the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
The overview as referred to in Book 2, Sections 379 and 414 of the Dutch Civil Code has been filed with the Trade
Register of the Chamber of Commerce of Utrecht.
De Volksbank N.V. is as a public interest entity in accordance with Book 2, Section 398 (7) of the Dutch Civil Code.
The company financial statements fully comply with the Dutch Annual Accounts Formats Decree (Besluit modellen
jaarrekening), model K for the statement of financial position and model L for the income statement.
Subsidiaries are all companies and other entities in respect of which de Volksbank N.V. has the power to govern
the financial and operating policies, whether directly or indirectly, and which are controlled by de Volksbank N.V.
The subsidiaries are accounted for using the equity method. The subsidiaries are regarded as an asset and liability
combination and not as an indivisible asset. The expected credit losses as prescribed in IFRS 9 on receivables
from subsidiaries in the company financial statements are eliminated and included in the carrying amount of the
receivables.
Changes in balance sheet values due to the results of subsidiaries, accounted for in accordance with de Volksbank
N.V. accounting policies, are included in the income statement. The distributable reserves of subsidiaries are
included in other reserves.
Receivables from and amounts due to subsidiaries are intercompany balances, and are valued at amortised cost.
The cashflow and fair value reserve qualify as legal revaluation reserves.
Liquid assets include the non-restricted demand deposits with the Dutch Central Bank and advances to credit
institutions with a remaining maturity of less than one month.

To: the shareholder and supervisory board of de Volksbank N.V.
Report on the audit of the financial statements 2022 included in the
integrated annual report
Our opinion
We have audited the financial statements 2022 of de Volksbank N.V. based in Utrecht. The financial statements
comprise the consolidated and company financial statements.
In our opinion:
• the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of de
Volksbank N.V. as at 31 December 2022 and of its result and its cash flows for 2022 in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EU-IFRS) and with Part 9 of Book
2 of the Dutch Civil Code
• the accompanying company financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of de
Volksbank N.V. as at 31 December 2022 and of its result for 2022 in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of
the Dutch Civil Code
The consolidated financial statements comprise:
• the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2022;
• the following statements for 2022: the consolidated income statement, comprehensive income, consolidated
statement of changes in equity and the consolidated cashflow statement;
• the notes comprising a summary of the significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
The company financial statements comprise:
• the company statement of financial position as at 31 December 2022;
• the company income statement for 2022;
• the notes comprising a summary of the accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Basis for our opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report.
We are independent of de Volksbank N.V. (‘the company’) in accordance with the EU Regulation on specific
requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities, the “Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties”
(Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the “Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-
opdrachten” (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and
other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore we have complied with the “Verordening
gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants” (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics).
We believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Information in support of our opinion
We designed our audit procedures in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming
our opinion thereon. The following information in support of our opinion and any findings were addressed in this
context, and we do not provide a separate opinion or conclusion on these matters.
Our understanding of the business
De Volksbank N.V. is a bank with a focus on mortgages, payments and savings as its most important products for
Dutch retail clients, through the brands SNS, ASN Bank, BLG Wonen and RegioBank. We paid specific attention in
our audit to a number of areas driven by the operations of the company and our risk assessment.
We determined materiality and identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error in order to design audit procedures responsive to those risks and
to obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
In order to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to provide an opinion on the consolidated financial
statements, we have performed a full-scope audit on the consolidated financial information of de Volksbank N.V. as
a whole (no components) and by one audit team.

Materiality
Materiality EUR 18 million (2021: EUR 17 million)
Benchmark
applied
0.5% of shareholder’s equity (2021: 0.5%)
Explanation Based on our professional judgment, a benchmark of 0.5% of shareholder’s equity is an appropriate quantitative
indicator of materiality as it best reflects the financial position of de Volksbank N.V. We determined materiality
consistently with the previous financial year.
We have also taken into account misstatements and/or possible misstatements that in our opinion are material for
the users of the financial statements for qualitative reasons.
We agreed with the supervisory board that misstatements in excess of EUR 0.9 million, which are identified during
the audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements that in our view must be reported on
qualitative grounds.
Teaming and use of specialists
We ensured that the audit team included the appropriate skills and competences which are needed for the audit
of a bank. We included specialists in the areas of IT audit, forensics, sustainability, income tax and capital ratios.
Furthermore, we have made use of our own experts in the areas of the loan loss provisioning, valuation of
derivatives, hedge accounting, employee benefits, and fair value disclosures.
Our focus on climate-related risks and the energy transition
Climate change and the energy transition are high on the public agenda and lead to significant change for many
businesses and society. The executive board reported in section 2 ‘Sustainability statements’ and section 4.9
‘Sustainability risk’ how the company is addressing climate-related and environmental risks also taking into account
related regulatory and supervisory guidance and recommendations. Furthermore, we refer to the ‘Sustainability
statements’ of the integrated annual report where de Volksbank discloses its publication of the climate action plan
in connection to climate related risks and the effects of energy transition.
As part of our audit of the financial statements, we evaluated the extent to which climate-related risks and
the possible effects of the energy transition and de Volksbank’s climate action plan are materially impacting
judgements, accounting estimates and significant assumptions applied by de Volksbank N.V., including those
related to the estimation of expected credit losses. Furthermore, we read the other information included in the
integrated annual report and considered whether there is any material inconsistency between the non-financial
information in section 2 ‘Sustainability statements’ and section 4.9 ‘Sustainability risk’ and the financial statements.
Based on the audit procedures performed, we do not deem climate-related risks to have a material impact on the
financial reporting judgements, accounting estimates or significant assumptions as at 31 December 2022.
Our focus on fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations
Our responsibility
Although we are not responsible for preventing fraud or non-compliance and we cannot be expected to detect
non-compliance with all laws and regulations, it is our responsibility to obtain reasonable assurance that the
financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. The
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
Our audit response related to fraud risks
We identified and assessed the risks of material misstatements of the financial statements due to fraud. During
our audit we obtained an understanding of the company and its environment and the components of the system
of internal control, including the risk assessment process and the executive board’s process for responding to the
risks of fraud and monitoring the system of internal control and how the supervisory board exercises oversight, as
well as the outcomes. We refer to section 4 ‘Risk management’ of the integrated annual report for the executive
boards’ risk assessment, that includes the considerations for the potential for fraud.
We evaluated the design and relevant aspects of the system of internal control and in particular the fraud
risk assessment, as well as the code of conduct, whistle blower procedures and incident registration in close
co-operation with our forensic specialists. We evaluated the design and the implementation of internal controls
designed to mitigate fraud risks.
As part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors with respect to financial reporting
fraud, misappropriation of assets and bribery and corruption, in close co-operation with our forensic specialists.
We evaluated whether these factors indicate that a risk of material misstatement due to fraud is present. In our

risk assessments we considered the potential impact of among others developments of key financial ratios, the
business development and organizational changes.
We incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit. We also considered the outcome of our other audit
procedures and evaluated whether any findings were indicative of fraud or non-compliance.
As in all of our audits, we addressed the risks related to management override of controls. For these risks we
have performed procedures among others to evaluate key accounting estimates for management bias that may
represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud, in particular relating to important judgment areas and
significant accounting estimates as disclosed in the ‘Significant accounting policies’ note to the financial statements.
We have also used data analysis to identify and address high-risk journal entries and evaluated the business
rationale (or the lack thereof) of significant extraordinary transactions. These risks did however not require
significant auditor’s attention during our audit. We did not identify a risk of fraud in revenue recognition.
The following fraud risk identified did require significant attention during our audit. As described in our key
audit matter ‘Estimation of expected credit losses on residential mortgages’, we specifically considered the risk
of management override of controls in connection with assumptions such as macro-economic scenarios and
forward-looking information in the determination of the expected credit losses.
We considered available information and made enquiries of relevant executives, directors (including risk,
compliance, crime, internal audit and legal) and the supervisory board.
The fraud risk we identified, enquiries and other available information did not lead to specific indications for fraud
or suspected fraud potentially materially impacting the view of the financial statements.
Our audit response related to risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations
We performed appropriate audit procedures regarding compliance with the provisions of those laws and
regulations that have a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Furthermore, we assessed factors related to the risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations
that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general industry
experience, through discussions with the executive board, inspection of the integrity risk analysis (SIRA), reading
minutes, inspection of reports from risk, compliance and internal audit and performing substantive tests of details
of classes of transactions, account balances or disclosures.
We also inspected lawyers’ letters and correspondence with regulatory authorities and remained alert to any
indication of (suspected) non-compliance throughout the audit. In case of potential non-compliance with laws and
regulations that may have a material effect on the financial statements, we assessed whether the company has
an adequate process in place to evaluate the impact of non-compliance for its activities and financial reporting
and, where relevant, whether the company implemented remediation plans amongst which for customer integrity.
Finally we obtained written representations that all known instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations
have been disclosed to us. We make reference to the key audit matter on the ‘Estimation of other, non-credit,
provisions and related disclosures’.
Our audit response related to going concern
As disclosed in the Basis of preparation section in the notes to the financial statements, the financial statements
have been prepared on a going concern basis. When preparing the financial statements, the executive board made
a specific assessment of the company’s ability to continue as a going concern and to continue its operations for the
foreseeable future.
We discussed and evaluated the specific assessment with the executive board exercising professional judgment
and maintaining professional skepticism. We considered whether the executive board’s going concern assessment,
based on our knowledge and understanding obtained through our audit of the financial statements or otherwise,
contains all relevant events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a
going concern and whether the company will continue to comply with prudential requirements. If we conclude that
a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in
the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.
Based on our procedures performed, we did not identify material uncertainties about going concern. Our
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future
events or conditions may cause a company to cease to continue as a going concern.

Our key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of
the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the supervisory board. The key audit
matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed. In comparison with previous year, our key
audit matters did not change.
Estimation of expected credit losses on residential mortgages
Risk Residential mortgages are measured at amortized cost less a provision for impairment. The provision for impairment
represents the company’s best estimate of expected credit losses. At 31 December 2022, the total gross mortgage loan
portfolio amounts to EUR 46.2 billion (2021: EUR 48.0 billion) and provision for expected credit losses of EUR 98 million
(2021: EUR 73 million) are reported and disclosed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. The notes to the
financial statements also disclose the ‘Changes in accounting policies, estimates and presentation’ related to the updated
provisioning model and interest-only mortgages.
The provision for impairment is based on expected credit losses which includes assumptions such as the probability
of default, the loss given default, the allocation of loans to stages and the use of macro-economic scenarios and
forward-looking information. In response to the higher estimation uncertainty under the current economic circumstances,
management overlays have been recognized.
The appropriateness of loan loss provisions is a key area of judgment for the executive board. The identification of
expected credit losses and the determination of the recoverability of residential mortgages are inherently uncertain
processes involving assumptions and factors, including scenarios for unemployment and housing prices and impact of
inflationary pressures and changing interest environment. The use of alternative modelling techniques and assumptions
could produce significantly different estimates of loan loss provisions.
As part of our risk assessment, we considered the potential risk of management override of controls and we identified a
significant risk with regard the collateral values as an important factor for loss given defaults and thus the expected credit
losses. Given the relative size of the residential mortgages of de Volksbank N.V., the complex accounting requirements
with respect to calculating provisions for expected credit losses and the subjectivity involved in the judgments made, we
considered this to be a key audit matter.
Our audit
approach
Our audit procedures included, amongst others, evaluating the appropriateness of de Volksbank N.V.’s accounting
policies related to expected credit losses in accordance with IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” and whether the accounting
policies have been applied consistently. We have obtained an understanding of the loan loss provisioning process
and tested the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls across the processes relevant to the expected
credit loss calculations, and performed substantive procedures as well. This included the allocation of loans into stages,
model governance, data accuracy and completeness, arrears management, multiple economic scenarios, post-model
adjustments, journal entry testing and disclosures.
With the support of our own modelling specialists, we assessed the adequacy of the provisioning models used by de
Volksbank N.V. and verified whether the models were adequately designed and implemented. We performed an overall
assessment of the provision levels by stage to determine if they were reasonable considering the risk profile of the
residential mortgage portfolio, arrears management and credit risk management practices and the macro-economic
environment. We challenged the criteria used to allocate loans to stage 1, 2 or 3 in accordance with IFRS 9 and tested
loans on appropriate staging. We tested the data used in the expected credit loss calculation by reconciliation to source
systems.
With the assistance of our own real estate valuation specialists, we tested the collateral values as this is an important
factor for the expected credit loss, in particular for stage 3 loans. We have assessed the indexation methodology for the
collateral valuation, checked the correct application thereof, and performed an independent valuation test for a selection
of collaterals.
With the support of our own economic specialists, we assessed the base case and alternative economic scenarios including
the impact of current macro-economic uncertainties and the recognition and documentation of management overlays. This
included challenging probability weights and the macro-economic forecasts across the scenarios, as well as assessing the
sensitivity of changes in the assumptions in the calculations.
We tested the appropriateness and the associated considerations of post-model adjustments. We also assessed
completeness of the adjustments based on industry sector information, portfolio characteristics and considering inherent
model uncertainties.

Estimation of expected credit losses on residential mortgages (continued)
Our audit
approach
Finally, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the disclosures relating to the provision for impairment losses,
as disclosed in note 7 to the financial statements and by reference in section 4.3 ‘Credit Risk’ of the risk management
paragraph of the integrated annual report, to evaluate compliance with disclosure requirements included in EU-IFRS. In
particular we evaluated that these disclosures adequately convey the degree of estimation uncertainty and the range of
possible outcomes under the different macro-economic scenarios.
Key
observations
Based on our procedures performed, we consider the provision for expected credit losses on residential mortgages to be
reasonable and in compliance with EU-IFRS. The disclosures relating to the provision for expected credit losses meet the
requirements of EU-IFRS.
Estimation of other, non-credit, provisions and related disclosures
Risk In accordance with IAS 37 “Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets”, de Volksbank N.V. provides for
obligations related to, among others, restructuring, legal claims and compliance matters. At 31 December 2022, a total
of EUR 66 million (2021: EUR 102 million) for these non-credit related provisions is recognized and detailed in note 16 to the
financial statements. In note 20 and note 21, the contingent liabilities and legal proceedings are presented. Furthermore, in
the risk management sections 4.1.2, 4.1.3 and 4.5.2 of the integrated annual report developments with regard to legal and
compliance risk are disclosed.
Developments at de Volksbank N.V. with regard to the internal organization, services to customers and the range of
products, as well as heightened regulatory scrutiny, give rise to increased attention from the executive board when
estimating the provisions, specifically in the determination of whether outflows in respect of identified matters are
probable and can be estimated reliably and the appropriateness of assumptions and judgments used in the estimation of
the provisions. Therefore, we consider this a key audit matter.
Our audit
approach
We obtained an understanding of the entity-level controls and the legal and regulatory framework of the company. Further,
we evaluated the design and implementation of controls by de Volksbank N.V. to identify, monitor and disclose provisions
for liabilities and claims, and to assess the completeness and accuracy of data used to estimate provisions.
For significant provisions, such as in connection with restructuring and compensation schemes, we challenged the
provisioning methodology and tested the underlying data and assumptions used. For cases which were settled during
2022, we verified the actual outflows and considered any remaining residual risk.
On a regular basis, we inquired with the risk, compliance, internal audit and legal departments of de Volksbank
N.V. to understand and discuss the existing and potentially new obligations and regulatory matters, amongst which
customer integrity. We examined the relevant internal reports as well as regulatory and legal correspondence to assess
developments and we performed follow-up procedures to examine the company’s assessment of the impact on the
financial statements and the adequacy of risk management disclosures. Where appropriate, we involved our compliance
specialists.
Furthermore, we assessed whether the disclosures provided on the other provisions and off-balance sheet items with
regard to restructuring, legal claims and compliance matters in note 16, note 20 and note 21 to the financial statements are
in accordance with the EU-IFRS requirements. Finally, we evaluated the appropriateness of the compliance and legal risk
disclosures in the risk management paragraph of the integrated annual report.
Key
observations
Based on our procedures performed we consider the provisions to be reasonable and in compliance with EU-IFRS. The
disclosures on provisions, contingent liabilities and commitments, and legal proceedings are considered adequate and
appropriate and meet the requirements under EU-IFRS.

Reliability and continuity IT environment
Risk The activities and financial reporting of de Volksbank N.V. are highly dependent on the reliability and continuity of
the IT environment. Effective general IT controls with respect to change management, logical access, infrastructure and
operations, secure to a large extent the integrity and continuity of the IT systems as well as the operating effectiveness of
the automated controls.
As described in the risk management sections 4.1.2, 4.1.3 and 4.5.2 in the integrated annual report, the IT environment
and the IT organization of de Volksbank N.V. are subject to process improvements. There is a risk that the general IT
control measures may not always operate as intended. The dependency on IT environment could lead to undetected
misstatements in financial reporting. Therefore we identified the reliability and continuity of the IT environment as a key
audit matter.
Our audit
approach
IT audit specialists are an integral part of the engagement team and assess the reliability and continuity of the IT
environment to the extent necessary for the scope of our audit of the financial statements. In this context, we evaluated
the design of the IT processes and tested the operating effectiveness of general IT controls.
As de Volksbank has outsourced a part of their IT organization we have evaluated the outsourced IT processes and IT
general controls from the relevant service providers in the context of the financial audit of de Volksbank. We inspected the
reports on the design and operating effectiveness of controls from these service providers, evaluated testing exceptions
and how complementary user entity control considerations have been addressed which were all tested effective.
Further, we obtained an understanding of the cyber security procedures and reporting. Following certain observations
related to the demonstrability of controls related to among others logical access and infrastructure management, we
performed additional substantive procedures to mitigate the risks.
Key
observations
Our testing of the general IT controls and the substantive tests performed, provided sufficient evidence to enable us to rely
on the adequate and continued operation of the IT systems relevant for our audit of the financial statements.
Report on other information included in the integrated annual report
The integrated annual report contains other information in addition to the financial statements and our auditor’s
report thereon.
Based on the following procedures performed, we conclude that the other information:
• is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements;
• contains the information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code for the management report and
the other information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained through our audit
of the financial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the other information contains material
misstatements. By performing these procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch
Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of the procedures performed is substantially less than the scope
of those performed in our audit of the financial statements.
The executive board is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including the management report
in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and other information required by Part 9 of Book 2 of
the Dutch Civil Code.

• identifying and assessing the risks that the integrated annual report does not comply in all material respects
with the RTS on ESEF and designing and performing further assurance procedures responsive to those risks to
provide a basis for our opinion, including:
• obtaining the reporting package and performing validations to determine whether the reporting package
containing the Inline XBRL instance document and the XBRL extension taxonomy files has been prepared in
accordance with the technical specifications as included in the RTS on ESEF;
• examining the information related to the consolidated financial statements in the reporting package to
determine whether all required mark-ups have been applied and whether these are in accordance with the
RTS on ESEF.
Description of responsibilities for the financial statements
Responsibilities of the executive board and the supervisory board for the financial
statements
The executive board is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in
accordance with EU-IFRS and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Furthermore, the executive board is
responsible for such internal control as the executive board determines is necessary to enable the preparation of
the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
As part of the preparation of the financial statements, the executive board is responsible for assessing the
company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting framework mentioned, the
executive board should prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless the
executive board either intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but
to do so. The executive board should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the
company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements.
The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the company’s financial reporting process.
Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objective is to plan and perform the audit engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and
appropriate audit evidence for our opinion.
Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not detect all
material errors and fraud during our audit.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial
statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the
effect of identified misstatements on our opinion.
We have exercised professional judgment and have maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit,
in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. The
‘Information in support of our opinion’ section above includes an informative summary of our responsibilities
and the work performed as the basis for our opinion.

Our audit further included among others:
• Performing audit procedures responsive to the risks identified, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion
• Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
company’s internal control
• Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and
related disclosures made by the executive board
• Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures
• Evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that
achieves fair presentation
Communication
We communicate with the supervisory board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing
of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant findings in internal control that we identify
during our audit. In this respect we also submit an additional report to the audit committee of the supervisory
board in accordance with Article 11 of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of
public-interest entities. The information included in this additional report is consistent with our audit opinion in
this auditor’s report.
We provide the audit committee of the supervisory board with a statement that we have complied with relevant
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters
that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the supervisory board, we determine the key audit matters: those matters
that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements. We describe these matters in our
auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare
circumstances, not communicating the matter is in the public interest.

To: the shareholder and supervisory board of de Volksbank N.V.
Assurance report of the independent auditor
Our conclusions
We have reviewed the non-financial information in the accompanying Integrated Annual Report for the year 2022
of de Volksbank N.V. at Utrecht. A review is aimed at obtaining a limited level of assurance.
Furthermore, we have audited the disclosures relating to the Net Promoter Score (hereinafter: the NPS disclosures)
within the non-financial information mentioned above. An audit is aimed at obtaining a reasonable level of
assurance.
Based on our review procedures performed nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the
non-financial information does not present, in all material respects, a reliable and adequate view of:
• The policy and business operations with regard to corporate social responsibility
• The thereto related events and achievements in 2022
in accordance with the reporting criteria as included in the section "Reporting criteria".
In our opinion the NPS disclosures are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the reporting criteria
as included in the section "Reporting criteria".
The scope of our assurance engagement is described in the section "Our scope".
Basis for our conclusions
We have performed our review of the non-financial information and our audit of the NPS disclosures in accordance
with Dutch law, including Dutch Standard 3810N, “Assurance-opdrachten inzake maatschappelijke verslagen”
(Assurance engagements relating to sustainability reports), which is a specified Dutch Standard that is based on
the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, “Assurance engagements other than audits or
reviews of historical financial information”. Our responsibilities under this standard are further described in the
section “Our responsibilities” of our report.
We are independent of de Volksbank N.V. in accordance with the “Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van
accountants bij assurance-opdrachten” (ViO, Code of ethics for professional Accountants, a regulation with respect
to independence). This includes that we do not perform any activities that could result in a conflict of interest
with our independent assurance engagement. Furthermore, we have complied with the “Verordening gedrags- en
beroepsregels accountants” (VGBA, Dutch code of ethics).
We believe that the assurance evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
conclusions.
Our scope
The non-financial information is included in the following chapters of the Integrated Annual Report:
• 1.2 Our strategy
• 1.3 Our strategic progress
• 2.1 Introduction
• 2.2 General disclosures
• 2.3 Material topics
• 2.4 Topic-specific disclosures
• Additional information - Our approach to reporting
• Additional information - Principles for Responsible Banking
• Additional information - GRI Content Index
The NPS disclosures consist of the disclosures relating to the KPI Net Promoter Score (NPS) as included in section
“1.3.1. Strong customer relationship” of the Integrated Annual Report.

Reporting criteria
The reporting criteria used for the preparation of the non-financial information are the Sustainability Reporting
Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Standards) and the applied supplemental reporting criteria,
including the UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative Principles for Responsible Banking, as disclosed in
chapters: “Our approach to reporting”, “Definition and methodology of strategic KPIs” and “Definitions of material
topics” of the Integrated Annual Report. The reporting criteria used for the preparation of the NPS disclosures are
disclosed in chapter “Definition and methodology of strategic KPIs”.
The non-financial information is prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards. The GRI Standards used are listed
in the GRI Content Index as disclosed in paragraph “GRI Content Index” of the Integrated Annual Report.
The absence of an established practice on which to draw, to evaluate and measure non-financial information
allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities and
over time.
Consequently, the non-financial information needs to be read and understood together with the reporting criteria
used.
Unaudited corresponding NPS disclosures
No audit, but a review, has been performed on the NPS disclosures for the periods prior to 2022. Consequently, the
corresponding NPS disclosures for the periods prior to 2022 are reviewed but not audited.
Limitations to the scope of our review and our audit
The non-financial information includes prospective information such as ambitions, strategy, plans, expectations,
estimates and risk assessments. Inherent to this prospective information, the actual future results are uncertain.
We do not provide any assurance on the assumptions and achievability of prospective information in the non-
financial information.
In the paragraph “1.3.2 Social impacts” the results of the Climate-neutral Balance sheet are presented. For
the Climate-neutral Balance sheet, calculations are mostly based on external sources and by using several
assumptions. These assumptions and external sources are disclosed in chapter “Definition and methodology
of strategic KPIs” of the Integrated Annual Report, which details the methodology used for the Climate-neutral
Balance sheet based on “The Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry” of the
“Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials’” (PCAF). We have not performed procedures on the content of the
assumptions or external sources, other than evaluating the suitability and plausibility of these assumptions and
external sources used.
The references to external sources or websites in the non-financial information are not part of the non-financial
information as reviewed and the NPS disclosures as audited by us. We therefore do not provide assurance on this
information.
Our conclusions are not modified in respect to these matters.
Responsibilities of the executive committee and the supervisory board
for the non-financial information
The executive committee is responsible for the preparation of reliable and adequate non-financial information in
accordance with the reporting criteria as included in the section “Reporting criteria”, including the identification
of stakeholders and the definition of material matters. The executive committee is also responsible for selecting
and applying the reporting criteria and for determining that these reporting criteria are suitable for the legitimate
information needs of stakeholders, taking into account applicable law and regulations related to reporting. The
choices made by the executive committee regarding the scope of the non-financial information and the reporting
policy are summarised in chapter ”Our approach to reporting” of the Integrated Annual Report.

Furthermore, the executive committee is responsible for such internal control as it determines is necessary to
enable the preparation of the non-financial information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to
error or fraud.
The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the non-financial reporting process of de Volksbank N.V.
Our responsibilities
Our responsibility is to plan and perform the assurance engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient
and appropriate assurance evidence for our conclusions.
Our review of the non-financial information is aimed at obtaining a limited level of assurance. Procedures
performed to obtain a limited level of assurance are aimed to determine the plausibility of information and vary
in nature and timing from, and are less in extent, than for a reasonable assurance engagement. The level of
assurance obtained in a review is therefore substantially less than the assurance obtained in an audit.
Our audit of the NPS disclosures is aimed at obtaining a reasonable level of assurance. Our audit has been
performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not have detected all material
errors and fraud.
We apply the “Nadere voorschriften kwaliteitssystemen” (NVKS, Regulations for quality management systems) and
accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures
regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and other relevant legal and regulatory
requirements. A further description of our responsibilities is included in the annex to this assurance report.

Annex to the assurance report of the independent auditor
Our review and our audit included amongst others:
• Performing an analysis of the external environment and obtaining an understanding of relevant sustainability themes and issues and
the characteristics of the company
• Evaluating the appropriateness of the reporting criteria used, their consistent application and related disclosures in the non-financial
information. This includes the evaluation of the results of the stakeholders’ dialogue and the reasonableness of estimates made by
the executive committee
• Evaluating the consistency of the non-financial information with the information in the Integrated Annual Report which is not
included in the scope of our review and our audit
• Reconciling the relevant financial information with the financial statements, or with information underlying to the financial
statements in case the reconciliation cannot be made directly
• Evaluating the overall presentation and content of the non-financial information
• Considering whether the non-financial information as a whole, including the disclosures, reflects the purpose of the reporting criteria
used
Our review of the non-financial information included amongst
others:
Our audit of the NPS disclosures included amongst others:
• Obtaining through inquiries a general understanding of internal
control, reporting processes and information systems relevant
for the preparation of the non-financial information, without
obtaining evidence about implementation or testing the
operating effectiveness of controls
• Inspected the Principles for Responsible Banking Self-
Assessment and reviewed the accuracy of the data and the
traceability of the process followed and documented by de
Volksbank N.V.
• Obtaining an understanding of the procedures performed by
the internal audit department and the external subject matter
experts of de Volksbank N.V.
• Identifying areas of the non-financial information with a higher
risk of misleading or unbalanced information or material
misstatements, whether due to error or fraud. Designing and
performing further assurance procedures aimed at determining
the plausibility of the non-financial information responsive to
this risk analysis. These procedures consisted amongst others
of:
• Interviewing management and relevant staff at brand and
corporate level responsible for the sustainability strategy,
policy and results
• Interviewing relevant staff responsible for providing the
information for, carrying out internal control procedures on,
and consolidating the data in the non-financial information
• Obtaining assurance information that the non-financial
information reconciles with underlying records of the
company
• Evaluating the suitability and plausibility of the assumptions
and external sources used in the calculations on which the
Climate Neutral Balance sheet is based
• Reviewing, on a limited test basis, relevant internal and
external documentation
• Performing an analytical review of the data and trends in the
information submitted for consolidation at corporate level
• Obtaining an understanding of the systems and processes for
collecting, reporting and consolidating the NPS disclosures,
including obtaining an understanding of internal control
relevant to our audit, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control
• Evaluating the procedures performed by the external subject
matter expert of de Volksbank N.V.
• Identifying and assessing the risks that the NPS disclosures are
misleading or unbalanced, or contain material misstatements,
whether due to error or fraud. Designing and performing
further audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate
to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk that the NPS
disclosures are misleading or unbalanced, or the risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is
higher than for one resulting from errors. Fraud may involve
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or
the override of internal control. These procedures consisted
amongst others of:
• Interviewing relevant staff responsible for providing the
information for, carrying out internal control procedures on,
and consolidating the data in the NPS disclosures
• Obtaining assurance evidence that the NPS disclosures
reconcile with underlying records of the company
• Evaluating relevant internal and external documentation,
on a test basis, to determine the reliability of the NPS
disclosures
• Performing an analytical review of the data and trends in the
information submitted for consolidation at corporate level
We communicate with the supervisory board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing
of the review and the audit and significant findings that we identify during our review and our audit. We also
communicate any significant findings in internal control that we identify during our audit.

OUR REPORTING APPROACH
The core of our reporting approach is based on
the pillars of transparency, relevance, reliability,
accuracy and comparability. Therefore, we not only
report on our successes, but also address our
dilemmas, improvement opportunities and negative
impact. Nevertheless, we are somewhat limited in our
openness as we cannot share any privacy-sensitive and
confidential information.
Our reporting is structured as follows:
• This Integrated Annual Report (IAR) has been
prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting
Initiative (GRI) 2021 standards and the International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The structure
of the Sections 2.2 General disclosures, 2.3 Material
topics and 2.4 Topic-specific disclosures is inspired by
the order of the GRI Standards. Read more in the GRI
Content Index 2022.
• This Integrated Annual Report is about de Volksbank
N.V. and all its business units and brands; we
consistently refer to them as ‘de Volksbank’. In
addition to the IAR we publish the Annual Review
2022 (Jaaroverzicht 2022), which includes a concise
yet comprehensive picture of our business model,
strategic choices and performance, and the external
context in which we operate. All non-financial figures
cover de Volksbank N.V. and all its business units and
brand, unless stated otherwise. For example, the KPI
Living Wage covers the garment companies in the
ASN Investment Universe. Furthermore, we publish the
Pillar 3 Report 2022.
• We also adhere to other multiple non-financial
reporting guidelines. Among which the EU's Non-
Financial Reporting Directive (2014), to which we
fully adhere. The required reference table can be
found in Section Non-Financial Reporting Directive.
We are also committed to the UN Principles for
Responsible Banking of which we also provide
an overview in Section Principles for Responsible
Banking. De Volksbank also structures its disclosure
on sustainability risks along the lines of the TCFD
guidelines, see Section Task Force on Climate-Related
Financial Disclosures for more details and the
reference table.
• This IAR was published on 10 March 2023. The
frequency of our reporting is yearly. We report on
calendar year 2022, which runs from 1 January up
to and including 31 December 2022. This holds
for all the information in the IAR, except for the
key environmental data of own business operations.
The 2022 data, as disclosed in section 2.5.3 Key
environmental data of our own business operations
cover the period 1 October 2021 until 30 September
2022, the 2021 figures cover the period 1 October 2020
up to and including 30 September 2021. Some of the
2021 figures in this section have been restated as a
result of better insights in the underlying data.
• The description of de Volksbank's approach of
acquisitions and disposals goes for both financial
and non-financial information, please refer to Section
Acquisitions and disposals for more information.
• The contents of this IAR originate from internal and
external sources. In the case of external sources, we
have added a reference to the source.
• In order to deliver a relevant report that addresses
the most important topics, we performed a materiality
assessment. In line with the Global Reporting Initiative
we report explicitly on our 8 most material topics,
using references and headers in this IAR. We also
touch on the remaining 10 other material topics, albeit
less prominently and detailed. The process followed
and outcomes can be found in Section 2.3 Material
topics.
• This IAR has been compiled by a multidisciplinary
team. The Social Impact Committee assessed
the contents and progress for the non-financial
information. The Executive Committee and Supervisory
Board of de Volksbank ultimately approved this IAR.
• We attach great value to producing a reliable
and accurate report. On that account we asked our
independent auditor, EY, for a combination of limited
assurance and reasonable assurance on the most
relevant non-financial information included in this
IAR. Details of the engagement provided to EY were
discussed by members of the ExCo as well as the
AC of the Supervisory Board. EY performed its work
in accordance with Dutch Assurance Standard 3810N
‘Assurance engagements relating to sustainability
reports’ as drawn up by the Netherlands Institute
of Chartered Accountants (NBA). No assurance is
provided for any forward-looking information. The
assurance report on non-financial information by EY
can be found in Section Assurance report. The report
on the financial statements can be found in Section
Independent auditor's report.
We highly value your opinion on this report, our
business operations and (potential) issues in the
value and supply chains in which we are active.
We therefore invite you to ask questions, provide
feedback and share tips, please let us know via
verantwoord.ondernemen@devolksbank.nl.
DISCLAIMER
Forward-looking statements reflect our convictions,
plans and expectations at the time of publication.
Words such as ‘ambition’, ‘plans’, ‘intention’ and
‘expectation’ are intended to clearly indicate such
statements in our report. Information about the
future is based on goals and informed estimates.
Nevertheless, new insights and external factors may
negate this information or lead to materially different
outcomes. We do not intend to publicly update this
information during the year. However, we may change
and/or delete this forward-looking information in
future publications, such as the interim results.

Principle 2: Impact and Target Setting
We will continuously increase our positive impacts while reducing the negative impacts on, and managing the
risks to, people and environment resulting from our activities, products and services. To this end, we will set and
publish targets where we can have the most significant impacts.
2.1 Impact Analysis (Key Step 1)
Show that your bank has performed an impact analysis of its portfolio/s to identify its most significant impact areas and determine
priority areas for target-setting. The impact analysis shall be updated regularly and fulfil the following requirements/elements (a-d).
a) Scope: What is the scope of your bank’s impact analysis? Please describe which parts of the bank’s core business areas, products/
services across the main geographies that the bank operates in have been considered in the impact analysis. Please also describe which
areas have not yet been included, and why.
Response
• De Volksbank operates in the Netherlands, the impacts have been identified on country level and not on local level as
the Netherlands is a small and not particularly diverse country.
• De Volksbank is a retail bank and therefore, in the impact identification tool, the focus is on consumer banking.
• The institutional banking identification module is as of yet out of scope of our impact analysis as this is not our main
business activity.
Links and
references
Company profile
b) Portfolio composition: Has your bank considered the composition of its portfolio (in %) in the analysis? Please provide proportional
composition of your portfolio globally and per geographical scope
i) by sectors & industries for business, corporate and investment banking portfolios (i.e. sector exposure or industry breakdown in %),
and/or
ii) by products & services and by types of customers for consumer and retail banking portfolios.
If your bank has taken another approach to determine the bank’s scale of exposure, please elaborate, to show how you have considered
where the bank’s core business/major activities lie in terms of industries or sectors.
Response
• The proportion of our overall consumer banking portfolio in gross income is 93% based on year-end 2021 data.
• Within the consumer banking identification module, mortgages and savings have been identified as our main
products . We also included consumer loans and current accounts in our consumer banking identification module.
• We serve all types of customers, from low to high income citizens, of all genders and all ages.
• Type of customers for consumer banking portfolio is as of yet out of scope of our portfolio composition.

c) Context: What are the main challenges and priorities related to sustainable development in the main countries/regions in which your
bank and/or your clients operate? Please describe how these have been considered, including what stakeholders you have engaged to
help inform this element of the impact analysis.
Response
Climate change threatens human communities and natural ecosystems all over the world. Our response to this challenge is
rooted in our strategy: we aim to create a positive social impact. Our Sustainability Policy Climate has been the cornerstone
in this respect for a long time, based on the Paris Agreement. We engage with different stakeholders, such as customers,
advisers, cooperation partners, industry/businesses, networks and society as a whole. Read more about it in Section 2.2.5
Stakeholder engagement.
The right to housing is embedded in our constitution, and is on the international agenda as one of the Sustainable
Development Goals to make the world a better place. The Dutch housing market is currently at an impasse. Housing
shortage is increasing, and for newcomers to the housing market it is difficult to find an affordable home. It is our ambition
to improve accessibility to housing. A first step towards this is to measure housing accessibility, as this was not done before
in the Netherlands. That is why BLG Wonen, Companen and PwC developed the Housing Accessibility Monitor. This monitor
provides insights into where and for whom different residential segments of the housing market in the Netherlands are
currently (not) accessible.
On top of that, the energy crisis and other crises have a true impact on the financial health of people. We consulted the
Financial Health Report (in Dutch only) drawn up by Deloitte, Nibud, ING and Leiden University. Three quarters of the
Dutch do not yet have their financial situation (fully) in order. One in ten households cannot make ends meet because

their income is insufficient. Seven in ten Dutch households save on a monthly basis. Even among financially healthy
people, there is room for improvement. Many Dutch people are guided by short-term attitudes. Men seem to be financially
healthier than women. Of the cities, the three largest cities are the least financially healthy in the Netherlands.
Based on these first 3 elements of an impact analysis, what positive and negative impact areas has your bank identified? Which (at least
two) significant impact areas did you prioritize to pursue your target setting strategy (see 2.2)? Please disclose.
Response
• Based on the impact analysis the positive and negative impact areas of de Volksbank are: climate stability, resource
intensity (within circularity), equality & justice, housing and finance (both within availability, accessibility, affordability,
quality of resources & services).
• The two impact areas we prioritise are climate stability and availability, accessibility, affordability, quality of resources
& services. Within the latter impact area, we focus on the impact topics housing and finance.
• Besides these two priorities we also signed the Financial Health & Inclusion Commitment, which matches the impact
topic finance.

d) Performance measurement: Has your bank identified which sectors & industries as well as types of customers financed or invested
in are causing the strongest actual positive or negative impacts? Please describe how you assessed the performance of these, using
appropriate indicators related to significant impact areas that apply to your bank’s context.
In determining priority areas for target-setting among its areas of most significant impact, you should consider the bank’s current
performance levels, i.e. qualitative and/or quantitative indicators and/or proxies of the social, economic and environmental impacts
resulting from the bank’s activities and provision of products and services. If you have identified climate and/or financial health &
inclusion as your most significant impact areas, please also refer to the applicable indicators in the Annex.
If your bank has taken another approach to assess the intensity of impact resulting from the bank’s activities and provision of products
and services, please describe this.
Response
Our current strategic objective to have a climate-neutral balance sheet consists of an estimation of the emissions avoided
with our activities and the emissions caused by us. De Volksbank's balance sheet largely consists of (retail) mortgages. The
SME portfolio, project financing and bank capital are also included in our climate performance measurement.
For the impact area 'housing', we are in the process of defining a performance measurement to measure our impact on
housing accessibility.
We are currently working on the Context Analysis for Financial Health & Inclusion. We already have various KPIs that relate
to this theme and in 2023 we will determine what our main contribution to this topic will be.

Response
Climate Stability
• In 2015, we set the goal of having a climate neutral balance sheet by 2030. As an intermediate target, we want to be at
least 75% climate neutral by 2025.
• Since 2015, we have been measuring and reporting on our pathway to a climate-neutral balance sheet. We speak of
a climate neutral balance sheet if we avoid, or even remove, as many emissions from the air with our financing and
investments as we cause. De Volksbank's balance sheet largely consists of (retail) mortgages. The SME portfolio, project
financing and bank capital are also included in our performance measurement on climate.
• At the first measurement at the end of 2014, the balance sheet was 16% climate neutral. There is no baseline for the
climate-neutral balance sheet, as this is based on the PCAF methodology which is improving over time.
• The energy efficiency ratings of our mortgage portfolio in 2015 were as follows: 7% A, 17% B, 31% C, 10% D, 8% E, 13 %
F and 14% G. This is the baseline for the energy efficiency rating of financed homes indicator.

• We are in the process of defining a performance measurement to measure our impact on housing
• In 2022, we translated this theme into three KPIs that we intend to develop further in 2023: 1) enable housing for
households with incomes up to and including twice modal; 2) sustainable recovery from financial care in the event of
major life events; 3) realise new housing units.
Financial health and inclusion
• We are in the process of defining a performance measurement on financial health. We have various measurements on
financial health, but we are working on a true ambition in this field, including our baseline and targets.
c) SMART targets: Please disclose the targets for your first and your second area of most significant impact, if already in place (as well as
further impact areas, if in place). Which KPIs are you using to monitor progress towards reaching the target? Please disclose.
Response
De Volksbank steers towards climate neutrality of its entire balance sheet. The target for 2030 is 100% climate-neutral, with
an interim target of 75% in 2025.
The climate-neutral balance sheet KPI is the balance in CO2 emissions between emitted CO2 emissions and avoided CO2
emissions across all assets. The following indicators help steer towards a climate neutral balance sheet.
• Average energy efficiency rating of financed homes.
• CO2 emissions from retail mortgages in kilotons CO2e.
• CO2 emissions from sustainable financing.
• CO2 emissions climate bonds.
• CO2 emissions business loans.
These indicators do not have a baseline because we calculate the emissions with the PCAF methodology, which improves
over time. The energy efficiency rating of financed homes does have a baseline and we have an internal target on this
indicator. The methodology for the climate neutral balance sheet and the indicators can be found in Section Definition
and methodology of strategic KPIs. The first two indicators are related to the scope of our impact analysis. Also our
Science Based Targets are related to our impact analysis. Since 2022, our Science Based Targets have been approved to
manage the climate neutral balance sheet in line with the 1.5 degree scenario. We underpin emissions reductions from
the climate-neutral balance sheet with these Science Based Targets. In 2030, the Science Based Target for the mortgage
portfolio is a 59% emissions reduction per m2 compared to baseline year 2020.
Housing
Our housing KPI is being developed and will be finalised in 2023, and has a focus on improving housing accessibility. In
terms of the likelihood of finding a suitable home, the differences between income groups are large. For households with
an income up to and including twice modal (€ 76,000), housing accessibility is only 18%. For households from twice modal
upwards, this figure is 50%. At de Volksbank, we are committed to increasing the accessibility to housing, even for people
with a modal income. Moreover, we measure how successful we are in increasing opportunities for people with reduced
access to the (owner-occupied) housing market.
Financial health & inclusion
Our ambition and KPI setting on for Financial Health & Inclusion is under development.

impacts.
Response
Climate stability
De Volksbank has many years of experience in mitigating and adapting to climate change. Our actions have resulted in
for example that our brand ASN Bank was a joint initiator for partnerships like PCAF and PBAF and ASN Bank having a
climate-neutral balance sheet. We will therefore continue these efforts.
In Our Climate Action Plan (CAP) we describe how we plan to take action to reduce our negative impact on the climate. We
provide a summary below on some points disclosed in the CAP .

• We will further strengthen our organisation’s efforts in making our (retail and business) customers aware of the need
to reduce GHG emissions and the potential risks and benefits. In addition, we will support them in finding the best
solutions to reduce such emissions.
• Moreover, we will be reassessing all product and service proposals of the last couple of years with the aim of supporting
our retail mortgage customers in reducing their energy consumption and GHG emissions of their homes by providing
them with loans and advice.
• We found that relatively small adjustments in the credit position of a customer, e.g. to invest in energy-savings
solutions, can lead to a disproportionate administrative burden, partly due to strict regulation. Together with our peers
we will engage with legislators and supervisory authorities to seek appropriate solutions in this respect. We will actively
engage in dialogue with peers on this matter.
• We will reassess the possibilities for our project finance department to participate in a wider range of projects such as
deal sizes, maturities and investment objects. We will finalise these above-mentioned assessments by the end of June
2023.
• The outcomes of the assessments will be the starting point for more detailed actions with starting points in 2024.
For Housing and Financial Health & Inclusion we have not yet created any action plans.

and enable sustainable economic activities. It should include information on relevant policies, actions planned/implemented to support
clients’ transition, selected indicators on client engagement and, where possible, the impacts achieved.
Response
• The highest negative impact on climate is caused by the mortgages of our customers. Therefore we have a sustainability
policy on housing, KPIs on the energy efficiency score of our mortgages and special programmes to encourage
homeowners to make their houses more sustainable.
• We aim to stimulate our customers to make sustainability-related improvements to their homes, such as measures to
save energy.
• We train our financial advisers on sustainability.
• The ASN Mortgage can be raised up to €30,000 for energy-saving measures.
• Customers receive an interest discount when taking out an ASN Mortgage for a home with energy efficiency rating of A
or higher.
• Through ASN Impact Investors, we make it possible for our customers to invest in sustainable equity funds, e.g. the ASN
Biodiversity Fund. ASN Bank discloses the impact of their investment on CO2 emissions to its customers.
• On the housing impact area, BLG Wonen wants to make decent living accessible to everyone. Especially for people for
whom this is not, or does not seem, easy to realise.
• In November 2022, BLG Wonen organised its annual Housing Debate, this time entitled 'Embrace innovation'. The event
focussed on numerous initiatives that have a positive impact on the accessibility to the housing market. Through this
event, BLG Wonen initiates and realises more collaborations between market parties.

Response
• We strive to make a positive impact on SDGs 8, 11, 13, 15 and 17. 
• We introduced a Personal Sustainability Loan. Customers can use this loan that has an attractive rate for sustainable
spending for energy-saving measures or for a Tiny House.
• ASN Bank expanded its product range with sustainable home, home contents and liability insurance products.
Customers have the option to have damage repaired with or replaced by second-hand or refurbished materials. The
insurance premium is invested in sustainable companies, governments and projects.
• We monitor the average energy efficiency score of our mortgage portfolio.
• Energy efficient mortgages: Aiming to make sustainability measures in these houses affordable to everyone, customers
can take out an ASN sustainable housing loan at a low interest rate concurrently with their ASN mortgage.
• In 2022, BLG Wonen participated in the development of the rental mortgage, in which landlords can get financing
provided they base their rent on the points-based system. This mortgage will be implemented in the first quarter of
2023.
• Green bonds: de Volksbank issued Green bonds contributing to more sustainable residential real estate.

with your portfolio. This can include aspects such as identification of significant/salient risks, environmental and social risks mitigation
and definition of action plans, monitoring and reporting on risks and any existing grievance mechanism, as well as the governance
structures you have in place to oversee these risks.
Response
• The integration of short, medium and long-term ESG risks within the risk management framework is based on the ECB
guide on climate-related and environmental risks, the EBA report on management and supervision of ESG risks for
credit institutions and investment firms and the TCFD recommendations.
• As sustainability risk is a key risk, we formulated a Risk Appetite Statement (RAS), which includes risk indicators and risk
limits to monitor sustainability risk. The Risk Management Function monitors the risk indicators for environmental risk
(transition risk as well as physical risk), social risk and governance risk. These risk indicators are reported to the ExCo in
the quarterly risk report.
• We have adopted very strict sustainability policies, including policies in relation to our sustainability pillars Climate,
Biodiversity, and Human Rights.
• To find out how our activities could be linked to human rights risks in international value chains, we follow the United
Nations Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights. Our previous salient human rights risk analysis identified as
one of our most salient issues a living wage in the garment industry. Therefore, our long-term objective is: By 2030, all
the 15 listed brands in which we invest need to have processes in place to ensure the payment of a living wage to the
workers that make the garments.

What are the next steps your bank will undertake in next 12 month-reporting period (particularly on impact analysis, target setting and
governance structure for implementing the PRB)? Please describe briefly.
Response
• The KPIs on housing and Financial Health & Inclusion, the baseline measurement and target setting will be further
developed in 2023.
• On the topic of climate, we will embed the actions formulated in the Climate Action Plan throughout the organisation.
• The Climate-neutral balance sheet KPI will be further improved and actions will be undertaken to reach the goals by
2030. We are the first Dutch bank with approved Science-Based Targets. Also, in 2022 we published our Climate Action
Plan, in which we set out our net zero 2050 goal.
• The organisation of the PRB working group will be evaluated and potentially adjusted.

If desired, you can elaborate on challenges and how you tackling these:
Over the past 12 months, de Volksbank has made good progress on implementing the Principles. Our two key areas of focus are Climate and
Housing and they have been embedded in the strategy of our bank. In 2021, we also committed the PRB's Financial Health & Inclusion topic.
We have updated the Impact Analysis and reconfirmed these three significant impact areas associated with our banking portfolio. We are a
frontrunner with our measurement of climate impact. Subsequently, we also use our expertise on impact measurement for the development of
KPIs on Housing and Financial Health. Data quality and data availability are key and we are embedding our KPI data set in the non-financial data
platform within our bank.

301de Volksbank N.V. Integrated Annual Report 2022
As from 2020, de Volksbank structures its disclosure
on sustainability risks along the lines of the TCFD
guidelines. The TCFD specifically covers climate-related
risks. Even so, we also include social and governance
risks in our sustainability risk management, in addition
to environmental risks such as climate-related risks.
Hence, these social and governance risks are also
included in our sustainability risk disclosures. All TCFD
pillars are discussed in this Annual Report.

311de Volksbank N.V. Integrated Annual Report 2022
The quantitative and qualitative information in
this IAR and the Annual Review 2022 was
collected on the basis of qualitative interviews and
quantitative data requests. For this purpose, we
consulted those responsible within the business
units and staff departments (project managers,
policy officers, programme managers, etc.). Additional
information, such as data on the composition of
our mortgage portfolio, information on employees
and environmental performance, was retrieved
from central or specific information systems.
The aforementioned method for measurement,
estimations and calculations is relevant for all
indicators related to the most material topics, unless
stated otherwise.
The internal control mechanism is based on multiple
levels of control. The Advisory Team Sustainability
is involved in checking and reviewing information
in the draft reports. The Social Impact Committee
reviews and approves the content before the Executive
Committee, AC and Supervisory Board give their final
approval.
In this IAR we presented the progress and results of
our strategic KPIs, see Section 1.3 Strategic Progress.
In the table below we provide more details about the
definition, used methodology and calculation methods
of these strategic KPIs.
Strategic KPI Definition
 
1 Customer-
weighted average
NPS
The customer-weighted NPS involves the
retail customer expressing a satisfaction
rating (in terms of probability of
recommendation). The higher the score,
the more satisfied the customer is.
2 Active multi-
customers
An active multi-customer is a customer
with a current account and at least one
product from another product group.
Both retail and corporate customers can
be considered an active multi-customer.
3 Customer-
weighted average
KRS
The customer-weighted average KRS
involves the retail customers expressing
a relationship rating (in terms of
satisfaction, trust and brand love). The
higher the score, the stronger the
perceived relationship is.
4 Genuine
attention
The extent to which employees feel they
are given genuine attention, based on five
themes (mission & strategy, trust, open
& people oriented, facilitating leadership
and professionalism & personal growth).
5 Climate-neutral
balance sheet
Our balance sheet is climate neutral
when we avoid, reduce or eliminate
as much CO2 emissions as we emit.
From 2021 onwards our climate-neutral
balance sheet is calculated with the PCAF
methodology. Read more about this KPI
below.
1. CUSTOMER-WEIGHTED AVERAGE NPS
De Volksbank measures the customer-weighted Net
Promoter Score (NPS), a customer-loyalty metric,
for all its brands on a quarterly basis. The survey
is conducted by an external party which draws a
representative sample from an external consumer
panel for each brand. The sample size varies per
brand and ranges from 500 to 1,000 customers. The
customer-weighted NPS indicates the ratio between
the so-called detractors and promoters on a scale
from 1 to 10. Respondents are grouped as follows:
'Detractors' (scores 0 - 6), customers are unhappy and
can damage de Volksbank's brand and impede growth
through negative word-of-mouth. 'Passives' (scores 7
- 8), customers are satisfied but unenthusiastic and
are vulnerable to competitive offerings. 'Promoters'
(scores 9 - 10), customers are loyal enthusiasts who
will keep buying and refer others, fuelling growth.
By subtracting the percentage of detractors from
the percentage of promoters the NPS per brand is
calculated, this figure can be somewhere between
-100% and +100%. The total result of the NPS for de
Volksbank is calculated as a weighted average based
on the total number of retail customers per brand and
is reported based on the last quarter's results.
NPS reporting per brand is also based on last quarter's
reporting period. The calculation for the weighted
average NPS for de Volksbank only considers the
total number of retail customers per brand; corporate
customers are excluded. The weighted average is
based on the number of customers at the end of
the middle month of each quarter, aligning the NPS's
measurement method that reflects the average for the
relevant quarter of retail customers only.
2. ACTIVE MULTI-CUSTOMERS
The KPI Active multi-customer is measured every
month using our internal data systems. An active
multi-customer is a customer with a current account
and at least one product from another product group.
Both retail and corporate customers can be considered
an active multi-customer. An active current account is
a current account on which the customer initiated at
least ten transactions for three months in a row. For
customers under the age of 18, five transactions for
three months in a row is enough.
3. CUSTOMER-WEIGHTED AVERAGE KRS
The customer-weighted average Customer
Relationship Score (KRS) for all banking brands (SNS,
ASN Bank, RegioBank) is measured on a quarterly
basis. The customer-weighted average Net Promotor
Score (NPS) (3) is measured for all brands (SNS, ASN
Bank, RegioBank, BLG Wonen), also on a quarterly
basis. Both metrics are measured in the same survey.
The survey is conducted by an external party which
draws a representative sample from an external
consumer panel for each brand. The sample size varies
per brand and ranges from 500 to 1,000 customers.
The customer-weighted average KRS is based on the
customers' satisfaction, trust and brand love regarding
their bank. With an extended matrix the strength of
the relationship is calculated. The calculation results
in a 6-point scale representing the strength of the
relationship: Very weak (1), Weak (2), Moderate (3),
Fairly strong (4), Strong (5), Very strong (6).

The stronger the perceived relationship, the more
likely the customer is to stay as a customer, to buy
more products and services, to share more personal
data, to recommend de Volksbank to others and to
help making social impact together. The total result of
the customer-weighted average KRS for de Volksbank
is calculated as a weighted average based on the total
number of retail customers per brand and is reported
based on the average of the whole year.
KRS reporting per brand is also based on average
year’s reporting period. The calculation for the
customer-weighted average KRS for de Volksbank
only considers the total number of retail customers
per brand; corporate customers are excluded. The
weighted average is based on the number of
customers at the end of the middle month of each
quarter, aligning the customer-weighted average KRS’s
measurement method that reflects the average for the
relevant quarter of retail customers only.
4. GENUINE ATTENTION
The KPI genuine attention is measured twice a year as
part of the employee survey, which is conducted by
a third party among all of de Volksbank’s employees.
In the survey, employees are asked whether they feel
they are given genuine attention, using five themes,
i.e. mission & strategy, trust, open & people oriented,
facilitating leadership and professionalism & personal
growth.
5. CLIMATE-NEUTRAL BALANCE SHEET
As far as the KPI for climate-neutral balance sheet
is concerned, de Volksbank signed the Principles for
Responsible Investments Montreal Pledge in 2015,
which means that we report on the impact of our
investments on the climate in a transparent way.
The same goes for de Volksbank signing the Dutch
Climate Agreement in June 2019, thus endorsing the
reporting on its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from
loans and investments as from 2020. We aligned our
GHG reporting with our long-term goal of obtaining
a climate-neutral balance sheet by 2030 at the latest,
which is a KPI for de Volksbank. We apply the PCAF
methodology to calculate the progress on this KPI.
In this regard, we received limited assurance by an
independent assurance provider on our disclosure in
the Integrated Annual Review 2021.
Reporting requirements
The GHG Protocol ‘Corporate Value Chain Standard’
offers guidance to identify and report on emissions
from relevant loans. These include emissions from
loans and investments reported under scope 3,
category 15: Investments, which is the banks’ most
material category to take into account. The results
of our climate-neutral balance sheet progress are
presented in a way that we coined as a Climate Profit
& Loss account. It shows positive climate impacts
(Emission avoidance and sequestration) and negative
climate impacts (GHG emissions). In order for us to
achieve full climate neutrality, the positive climate
impact side must be equal or greater than the negative
climate impact side. We report on our GHG emissions
in our annual reports in conjunction with our full-year
financial results, as well as in our Interim Financial
Reports after the second quarter of each calendar
year. We may also provide interim updates and
standalone thematic reports when deemed relevant.
Scope
The Climate Profit & Loss account, and therefore the
KPI Climate-neutral balance sheet, includes all relevant
balance sheet items of de Volksbank. Tax assets,
and other assets do not cause GHG emissions and
are therefore set at zero emissions. Derivatives are
also out of scope to avoid double counting. Tangible
and intangible assets are taken into account in the
emission calculations of the business operations.
The rest of the accounting balance sheet (97%)
is taken into account in the calculations of the
climate-neutral balance sheet. The GHG emission
calculations were conducted in collaboration with
Guidehouse, a provider of consultancy services, and
are performed in accordance with the GHG Protocol's
operational control approach. In our GHG accounting
and reporting, we follow the principles of relevance,
completeness, consistency, transparency and accuracy.
Furthermore, financed emissions are always accounted
for with the prudence principle in mind.
Reporting
All seven gases under the Kyoto protocol are taken
into account and expressed in CO2 equivalents using
the 100-year time horizon global warming potentials
as determined by the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC). We disclose the absolute
emissions (scope 1 and 2 combined) of our loans and
investments. When relevant, we also disclose financed
scope 3 emissions. Avoided emissions and carbon
removals are calculated and reported separately from
caused emissions. Apart from absolute emissions,
we report emission intensities in tons of carbon
dioxide equivalents per million euro invested or
lent out. For the mortgage portfolio, we also report
the average energy label based on the latest
available registered energy labels (Rijksdienst Voor
Ondernemend Nederland, RVO) and the most recent
version of the preliminary energy labels.
Process
For new loans and green bonds the most recent
emissions data is used. Emission factors and data
sources used for the calculations are updated annually
in the second quarter to ensure we use recent
data in our calculations. Our Sustainability Expertise
Centre department collects emission data and financial
data from investees and makes calculations for the
climate-neutral balance sheet every quarter. The
results are checked by Guidehouse. The quarterly
results are discussed and approved by the Societal
Impact Committee. The results are also reported in
management and risk reports.
Methodology
PCAF aims to develop a standard for calculating
financed emissions. In recent years, PCAF has grown
into a global collaborative venture to which a large
part of businesses in the Dutch financial services
sector actively contributes. The first Global Carbon
Accounting Standard was introduced in November

2020 taking into account the efforts and expertise
of more than 350 financial institutions around the
world. An update followed mid December 2022 leading
to the second GHG accounting standard by PCAF,
including methodologies for emission removals and
sovereign bonds. Due to the short time period after
publishment we are still applying the first version
of the PCAF GHG accounting standard. We deviate
from PCAF methodology on private mortgages where
we apply a more strict approach and attribute full
emissions to our assets instead of a loan-to-value
based attribution approach. However, we intend to
provide an attribution factor based on loan-to-value
at inception, on which financed emissions in line with
PCAF methodology could be calculated.
Data quality
For each of the asset classes, we apply the
corresponding data quality scores of the PCAF
methodology. The weighted average data quality score
for all assets in the climate-neutral balance sheet
calculation was calculated at 3.0 (1 = highest data
quality; 5 = lowest data quality). We continually strive
to increase the data quality of the data in our
calculations. In 2022, we updated the anonymised
energy consumption data of the customers in our
mortgage portfolio. The gas consumption data and
electricity consumption data covered 91% and 95%
of the private mortgages customer base, respectively.
The consumption data for the business mortgages
have not been updated and we have started using
sector averages based on the PCAF database. The data
quality has been lowered because of this compared to
last year.
For the asset class-specific considerations and data
sources used in our calculations, see the table on the
next page.

1 The update of the PCAF Global GHG standard has been launched mid-December. It provides a methodology for sovereign bonds but we have not been able to
implement the methodology due to the late update. We currently apply the methodology developed by PCAF Netherlands to take into account these emissions.
2 The PCAF Global GHG standard does not provide a methodology for green bonds yet. Green bonds are interpreted as corporate bonds until a methodology is
provided within the PCAF Global GHG standard.
3 As of this year we started using the CBS emission factor which is updated annually. This emission factor aligns with Dutch statistical data including averages on
consumption data by the CBS, and the Climate and Energy Outlooks published by PBL.
